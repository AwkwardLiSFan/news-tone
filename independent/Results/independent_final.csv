Gordon Brown warns UK facing economic 'double cliff edge' from Covid and Brexit,-0.375,Negative,"Former prime minister Gordon Brown has warned the government it will have to introduce further financial measures to stem a surge in unemployment brought on by the 'double cliff edge' of Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Brown, the longest serving chancellor of the modern era who steered the country through the 2008 financial crisis, predicted the current resident of 11 Downing Street, Rishi Sunak, would soon be forced to go back to the commons to extend the 'very limited' wage replacement schemes currently in place. Addressing a Welsh Labour Party event, Mr Brown said: 'I think we've got two cliff edges coming, if it is possible to go over two cliff edges at once. 'We've got October 31 and the end of the furlough scheme, and then we've got the end of the negotiations over Brexit. 'You've got two critical points where at each of them, jobs are at risk.' Pedestrians walk pas the Royal Seabank Hotel in Blackpool as Lancashire enters tier 3 of the government's coronavirus alert system Getty A person wearing a face mask is reflected in an art work entitled ""A=V"" by Ben Cullen Williams in Covent Garden, London REUTERS A gallery technician poses next to The Seagram Murals, by artist Mark Rothko during the New Collection Displays photocall at Tate Britain in London Getty Images A red deer stag stands behind females, called hinds, during the rutting (breeding) season which takes place during autumn, in Bushy Park, south west London AP RAF personnel speak to residents in Selly Oak, close to the University of Birmingham, assisting with Birmingham City Council's 'Drop and Collect' coronavirus test distribution, as the local authority attempt to stem the rise of cases in the area PA A member of staff pours a drink in the Richmond pub in Liverpool as Prime Minister Boris Johnson reads a statement on television, as parts of the North of England are bracing themselves for the most stringent Tier 3 control PA Steampunks attend the 'socially distanced' Haworth Steampunk Weekend, in the quiet village in the Pennine hills of West Yorkshire PA Members of the public watch the koi fish in the Kyoto Garden at Holland Park in London.

His new proposals seem very limited. 'I believe the Chancellor will have to come back to House of Commons quite soon to update, revise and change his plans because it is simply not adequate for the circumstances of today. 'We praised him in March for doing the furlough and I'm afraid now he has proved he is not doing enough to help us through this crisis, and unemployment will definitely rise very fast if he doesn't take further action.' Mr Brown, who served as a leading voice in the global response to the 2008 financial crash, said international cooperation would once again be vital in saving economies from the impacts of the virus. However, he said he saw little evidence of a global response to the financial woes brought on by the virus. 'The G20 is not operational and there is no sense that there is a co-ordinated global strategy,' he said. 'When you get a crisis like this '” and this is a crisis worse than 2008 '” you have got to be very clear what the problem is. 'It is clearly a health problem that's got to be dealt with and I can't understand why '¦ Right at the beginning, when you have no vaccine, no cure and therefore no way of ending the disease, you have got to test, test and test. 'That's what we should have been doing right from the beginning, and the government stopped testing in the first few weeks and I don't think we've ever fully recovered from that.' ",-0.5,Negative
"Brexit: There is 'no point' in Michel Barnier coming to London for talks on Monday, Downing Street says",-0.25,Negative,"There is ""no point"" in Michel Barnier coming to London on Monday for planned Brexit talks, Downing Street has said, after Boris Johnson said negotiations were over unless Brussels adopted a 'fundamental change of approach'. EU leaders refused to back down on Friday despite the prime minister's warning, with Emmanuel Macron telling reporters that they were ""not there simply to make the British prime minister happy"" and European Council president Charles Michel warning: ""What we said yesterday remains right today."" The 27 presidents and prime ministers had said in a joint statement that the UK would have to 'make the necessary moves to make an agreement possible'  - enraging the British side, who accused them of ""an unusual approach to conducting a negotiation"". Officials in the EU capital say Mr Barnier is still planning to travel to London on Monday for further discussions, despite warnings from Downing Street that he might not get the warmest of welcomes. The EU has offered two further weeks of discussions in a bit to avert a no-deal exit from the single market in December. The prime minister's chief negotiator Lord Frost is understood to have told Mr Barnier in a telephone conversation on Friday evening that there would be ""no basis"" for talks on Monday given the EU's position. But Mr Barnier's trip to the British capital was confirmed by Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who said: ""As planned, our negotiation team will go to London next week to intensify these negotiations.""  Downing Street said on Friday that Mr Barnier should 'only come to London next week if you are prepared to discuss all issues"" and that the UK should not be ""required to make all the moves"", adding: 'If not, there is no point in coming.' But Boris Johnson has stopped short of acting on his earlier threat to totally shut down negotiations if no deal was agreed by the summit - though his spokesperson argued that the EU had ""effectively ended"" talks with their statement about not wanting to change their position. Speaking a press conference in London later on Friday, the prime minister said: ""I think we've got to a stage, alas, where they don't seem to want to progress a free trade deal.  ""That was pretty clear from the conclusions of the summit; they don't want to go any further. Unless that fundamentally changes we're going to have to come out on Australian terms but we'll prosper mightily nonetheless."" The prime minister refused to engage on the question of how the car industry or cattle and livestock farmers would cope with high tariffs from no-deal, repeating only that he believed Britain would ""prosper mightily"" under the arrangement.  The three major intractable issues remaining are the question of fishing rights, governance, and a level playing field in regulations, particularly around state aid. Of these, fishing has seen the least progress, though EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has previously hinted the EU is willing to compromise. The issue is particularly serious for the French, whose president Emmanuel Macron escalated the war of words at his own press conference, telling reporters: ""The remaining 27 leaders of the EU, who chose to remain in the EU, are not there simply to make the British prime minister happy."" But despite repeating his mantra that France would not ""accept a Brexit that sacrifices our fishermen"" Mr Macron acknowledged that his fleets would not be able to enjoy the status quo after 31 December.

The rising risk of no-deal comes as polling for The Independent by BMG finds that the public are pessimistic about the coming economic hit from leaving the single market and customs union. 45 per cent of voters believe the economic impact over the next few years will be negative, with just 25 per cent positive. The public have a more positive outlook for the long, term however, with 42 per cent foreseeing positive long-term consequences a decade or more after Brexit and 30 per cent negative long-term effects. Most economists believe that a no-deal Brexit will deal a heavy blow to the UK'™s GDP, and also have a strongly negative long-term effect. ",-0.25,Negative
"Brexit: Britain has 'much more to lose' in fishing talks, warns former French minister",-0.75,Negative,"A former French minister has warned the UK that it has 'much more to lose' in the event of a no deal Brexit than the EU does, amid continued negotiations over issues including fishing rights. Nathalie Loiseau, an MEP who was formerly France's European Affairs Minister, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that talks 'are not going well' and there has not been 'sufficient progress on key issues'. The French politician cited disagreements on EU fishing boats' access to British waters as the chief stumbling block to a post-Brexit trade deal between the two sides.  Ms Louiseau said it remained unclear whether the British government had the political will to 'dig into details' to ensure an agreement was reached before the end of the UK's transition period on 31 December. 'Nobody wants a no deal but we all know as well that the UK has much more to lose because the UK is asking for full access to the single market,' she added.  Her comments come after negotiators failed to reach an 'outline' trade deal by Boris Johnson's self-imposed deadline of 15 October. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab expressed his disappointment on Friday at the position of EU leaders, who said in a joint statement this week that it was up to the UK ""to make the necessary moves to make an agreement possible'. Mr Raab told the BBC that the areas of disagreement are 'really narrow' and that a deal could be achieved with 'flexibility on both sides'.  ""It feels a little bit lacking from the European Union,' he added.  Lord Frost, the UK's chief negotiation with the bloc, tweeted on Thursday that he was also 'disappointed' by the language used by the European Council on Thursday. He said he was surprised by the suggestion that to achieve an agreement 'all future moves' must come from the UK. The prime minister is expected to give an announcement later on Friday concerning the UK's reaction and approach to trade talks with the EU.  ",-0.125,Negative
Brexit: Businesses fear 'dual impact' of coronavirus and no-deal departure from EU,-0.875,Negative,"More than half of UK companies fear that the Covid pandemic will magnify the negative impact of a no-deal Brexit on their business, a survey has found. Since the beginning of the outbreak, there has been speculation that Brexiteers will be spared immediate blame for any disruption when the UK transitions to its new relationship with the EU at the end of 2020, because its impact will be masked by the massive social and economic damage of coronavirus. But some 54 per cent out of almost 1,000 company directors taking part in the survey said that Covid-19 will actually compound the pain of a no-deal Brexit, while just 9 per cent said that the effects of leaving the EU without a trade deal would be mitigated by the pandemic. The survey was released by the Institute of Directors on the day Boris Johnson is due to announce whether he will walk away from talks with Brussels after missing his self-imposed 15 October deadline to secure a free trade agreement. He has previously said that after this date, businesses and individuals should prepare for a possible no-deal Brexit - which he refers to as an 'Australian-style arrangement' because Australia has no trade deal with the EU. Leaving without a deal would mean the UK moving to World Trade Organisation terms, with significant tariffs on many goods imported and exported with its European neighbours. Just one-fifth of businesses questioned by the IoD (21 per cent) said their business was ready for the end of the transition period, when the UK faces significant new bureaucratic burdens as a result of leaving the single market and customs union with or without a deal. With just 76 days to go until the deadline, almost a quarter of firms (24 per cent) said they not sure of being ready by the end of the year and a further fifth (21 per cent) said they had work to do but believed they would complete it in time. One per cent of companies said they had shut down the UK part of their business in response to Brexit, and a further 3 per cent said they plan to before the end of the year. Some 5 per cent said they had either stopped selling to the EU or intended to and 4 per cent said they were being cut out of EU supply chains. Four per cent said they had already transferred staff to the EU and 5 per cent plan to, while 16 per cent said they had relocated or opened up operations on the continent and 8 per cent will do so by the end of the year. IoD senior policy advisor Allie Renison said: ""The prospect of no-deal would be daunting enough, let alone dealing with it in the middle of a global pandemic. These disruptions won't cancel each other out, if anything they would compound the pain for British businesses.  ""When it comes to preparing for Brexit proper, directors' hands have been tied by a number of constraints and competing pressures. Reacting to the pandemic has taken up so much of business leaders' time and energy throughout the year. On top of this, much of the information companies need is still subject to negotiations.  ""Brexit adjustments will further add to businesses' cashflow challenges in the months ahead. The government must look to how it can smooth that process. Financial support as seen in other countries, whether through vouchers to help access advice or through extending tax reliefs to facilitate that adjustment, would give small firms a much better chance of coping."" Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: ""Businesses are experiencing extreme uncertainty, facing the pressures of the coronavirus crisis, a deep recession and the end of the transition period approaching.  ""It is vital that Boris Johnson delivers the oven-ready trade deal he promised was ready and then answers the questions so many businesses are asking about the future arrangements they need to plan for.' And the chief executive of the Best for Britain campaign against no-deal, Naomi Smith, said: ""Far from Covid obscuring the impact of a no-deal Brexit, the dual impact is giving business leaders sleepless nights. ""The best way to soften the double economic blow coming our way this Christmas would be for the the government to agree a trade deal with the EU as soon as possible. A no-deal Brexit would be disastrous in the current climate."" A UK Government spokesperson said: 'With fewer than three months to go, businesses need to prepare now for new procedures whether or not we reach a trade agreement with the EU, so that they can seize the significant opportunities that lie ahead. ""To help businesses get ready, we have launched a major communications campaign in the UK and EU, committed to investing £705m in jobs, infrastructure and technology at the border and provided a £84m support package to boost the capacity of the customs intermediary sector.""

Brexit: EU leaders drop pledge to 'intensify' trade talks as Boris Johnson threatens walk-out,0.125,Positive,"EU leaders have dropped a pledge to ""intensify"" Brexit negotiations after this week's summit, in signs that Brussels is prepared to call Boris Johnson's bluff on his threat to walk away from trade talks. A leaked draft of conclusions prepared by officials ahead of the Thursday meeting had urged Michel Barnier to step up the pace of negotiations to reach a deal. But the final version seen by The Independent, which was drawn up after further behind the scenes negotiation, has a downgraded Brexit section with all reference to intensification removed. The conclusions now simply say that the ""European Council invites the UnionÊ¼s chief negotiator to continue negotiations in the coming weeks, and calls on the UK to make the necessary moves to make an agreement possible"". Mr Johnson on Wednesday night spoke with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and her Council counterpart Charles Michel, telling them he was disappointed at the progress so far. The prime minister said he would wait until after the summit had concluded on Friday to decide whether he would walk out of talks and prompt a no-deal. He had previously said in September that the summit was a deadline for reaching an agreement.  The change to the draft conclusions, which are not yet final and could be changed further by leaders later on Thursday, suggests hawks on the European Council have been successful in arguing for firmer treatment of Britain - even if only in tone. Arriving at the summit, French president Emmanuel Macron said: 'It is possible that there will be no agreement,' adding: 'We are prepared for it.' German chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters: 'We want a deal, but obviously not at any price. It has to be a fair agreement that serves the interests of both sides. This is worth every effort.' This phase of Brexit talks, to strike a trade deal to go with the divorce deal struck last year, has been overshadowed on both sides of the Channel by the Covid-19 pandemic - with a resulting lack of political urgency and attention so far.

"Waiting for Brexit: Another deadline, likely another delay",0.5,Positive," It is yet another vital deadline day in the four-year torturous trek called Brexit but Spoiler Alert!: most likely nothing will happen. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had set the first day of the European Union summit on Thursday as the deadline to get a trade and security deal to replace its EU membership that expired on Jan. 31. A transition period is set to come to an end on Jan. 1, forcing negotiators to work fast if any deal still is to get legislative approval and legal vetting in the little time left.  EU leaders opening their two-day summit have left the talks to the bloc's negotiating team, but with the need for haste they are aiming to reinject vigor into negotiations that have been sluggish on the most important issues.  Beyond the call for speed, the leaders are also set to flaunt their unity, something Britain has failed to dent during years of talks on the withdrawal conditions and now on a bare trade deal with the new non-member. It is indicative that Johnson's call that Oct. 15 would be the deadline has made precious little impact.  Johnson's office said after a video call with EU leaders Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen that the prime minister 'looked forward to hearing the outcome of the European (Summit) and would reflect before setting out the U.K,.s next steps."" Few doubt that Johnson will lean toward continuing the talks for a few more weeks. The negotiations remain in a deep rut over fundamental differences on the issues of state aid, common standards of regulation and fisheries. Both sides acknowledge that little progress was made over the past two weeks on those key issues. Johnson's office said that the prime minister in his talks with the two EU leaders 'expressed his disappointment that more progress had not been made over the past two weeks.'  A trade deal has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of jobs and not exacerbate the economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.  Overall, the EU says Britain is trying to retain the advantages of EU membership without the commitment to play by the bloc's rules. Britain says it is baffled it can't get a quick deal with generous free trade concessions like Canada got a few years ago.  But EU nations like France want the access of U.K. companies to the EU market to be very strict because of the nation's sheer proximity and the similarity in goods and service that are traded. They want to make sure British firms won't be able to undercut their continental rivals with weaker environmental and social regulation and excessive state subsidies.  France is viewed, especially by Britain, as one of the nations most unwilling to compromise, especially on the issue of French boats' access to British fishing waters. Since last month, the member states have also become ardent in demanding legal guarantees on governance of any deal after Johnson introduced legislation in September that breaches the Brexit withdrawal agreement he himself signed with the EU only last year.  It left trust in the Johnson government shattered, and the European Parliament, which must approve any deal, has vowed not to approve any trade deal if the U.K. government doesn't withdraw this legislation. Britain says it will keep the legislation, with the option to use it if necessary.   ___ Jill Lawless contributed from London. ",0.25,Positive
Brexit: EU business chiefs warn no-deal could have 'cascading' consequences for them and risk tens of thousands of jobs,0,Neutral,"A no-deal Brexit could cost ""tens of thousands of jobs"" in continental Europe and have ""cascading"" economic consequences, EU business federations have warned - as the future of trade talks hangs in the balance In a rare joint intervention on the eve of a make-or-break summit in Brussels, the German, Italian and French versions of the CBI put pressure on both sides to ""be pragmatic"" to reach a deal.  Boris Johnson has said he will decide whether to quit talks on Friday after the 27 EU heads of government meet to discuss the way forward. EU diplomats say negotiations could continue into early November, but Mr Johnson has said he could walk away if there is no sign of movement at tonight's meeting.  ""A brutal split between continental Europe and the UK would add further difficulties to the difficulties and would undermine tens of thousands of jobs and activities in all our countries,"" warned the presidents of the Federation of German Industries, the General Confederation of Italian Industry, and the Movement of the Enterprises of France. The groups say the impact of a no-deal at a time ""our companies are devoting all their energy to limiting and correcting the health, social and economic effects of the Covid crisis"" would make the situation all the worse. The statement, from the largest employer groups in the three countries, is a rare acknowledgement of the impact of a no-deal on the continent.  While the potential economic damage to the UK from a no-deal is thought to be significantly higher, EU businesses are also worried, with some sectors more exposed than others. But the federations also urge EU leaders to preserve ""the solidarity of the 27 and the regular functioning of the single market"" - which Union negotiators have suggested British demands would undermine. ""This necessary agreement should not call into question what is at the heart of our European commitment and of our activities throughout the Union's territory: the solidarity of the 27 and the regular functioning of the single market,"" they say.

"Brexit: Portaloos needed for thousands of lorry drivers caught up in ports chaos, minister reveals",-0.25,Negative,"Portaloos will be set up in Kent and potentially in areas 'throughout the country' for lorry drivers caught up in ports chaos after Brexit. Rachel Maclean, the transport minister, revealed the plan - amid predictions of queues of up to 7,000 trucks unable to reach the continent. 'We have detailed plans that we worked up for provision of, not only portaloos, but other facilities for drivers, not only in Kent,' she told MPs. 'We don't want to see them in queues and we want to think about the impact on them,' she added. One MP warned of lorry driver already having to relieve themselves in lay-bys, with a 'proliferation of bottles that look like they're filled with Irn Bru'. Ms Maclean also conceded there will be a big shortage of permits for hauliers, if the UK crashes out of the transition period at the end of the year without a deal, admitting: 'We know it will not be adequate.' There are currently 8,000 firms with permission to drive in the EU - boasting 39,000 trucks - but as few as 2,200 could be available after 1 January. The portaloos plan comes after the revelation that truck drivers will need what has been dubbed a 'passport for Kent' - an access permit to enter the county, to ease congestion. Exporters face two-day delays to reach France, with 70 per cent of trucks not ready for new checks, creating the risk of queues of up to 7,000 lorries snaking through Kent.

It would include a movement reference number for each product, a safety and security declaration, an export health certificates and phytosanitary certificates - in order to drive to France. The EU is expected to impose full goods controls on the UK from 1 January, stopping all freight without the correct documentation as the reality of Brexit bites. The disruption is assumed to build in the first two weeks of January, but could last for three months or longer should France rigorously apply Schengen passport checks on hauliers. Ms Maclean admitted action would need to be taken to help lorry drivers stuck in 'stationary traffic', in Kent and 'a range of other areas throughout the country'. 'We really want to minimise the impact on those drivers who are already working really hard and we don't want to see them in queues and we want to think about the impact on them,' she told the committee. Richard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said lorries had been sent to Italy and Spain at the height of the pandemic to secure supplies for the UK.  But there was now a 'risk to our supply chain', without a deal 'if EU hauliers don't decide to come'.  ",-0.125,Negative
"UK's post-Brexit fishing protections 'pitifully weak', warn conservationists",-0.5,Negative,"Conservation organisations and MPs have said the government's rejection of a series of amendments designed to strengthen protections in the new UK Fisheries Bill indicates the Conservatives' ambition to protect vulnerable habitats is 'pitifully weak' and spells 'the end of sustainable fishing'. The bill replaces many elements of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy, which has governed the UK's fishing fleet since 1972, and will prevent foreign boats from fishing in British waters unless they have obtained a licence to do so. However, amendments including a provision to ban supertrawlers '” boats more than 100 feet long, which can catch and process 250 tonnes of fish in a single day '” from operating in marine protected areas, was rejected, as was an effort to introduce rules to keep fishing quotas within levels deemed 'sustainable' by scientists. The government described the legislation as 'the power to build a sustainable, profitable UK fishing industry and deliver a green Brexit with new protections for our precious marine environment', but since its inception environmental organisations have warned the bill could weaken protections on the UK's fish stocks. After the amendments aimed at banning overfishing supertrawlers were defeated in the House of Commons, the bill received an unopposed third reading and will now go to the House of Lords where peers are expected to further scrutinise the provision for sustainability and environmental protection. Luke Pollard, Labour's shadow environment secretary, told The Independent: 'The Tories have again voted against creating new jobs in our fishing communities and stopping supertrawlers destroying marine habitats. 'Britain's fishers and our seas deserve better.' Helen McLachlan, fisheries programme manager at WWF, said the bill 'sadly falls short of what's needed, and the UK has missed an opportunity to take the first crucial steps towards ocean recovery'. She said: 'Urgent action is needed by the UK government and devolved nations to end overfishing, restore and protect vital marine habitats and build resilience in our oceans. This is vital not only for the health of the marine environment but for the many businesses in our coastal communities.' Currently, the UK is assigned a quota as a proportion of the EU's Total Allowable Catch (TAC) under the relative stability principle (which uses historical data to set catch limits). With the new legislation, the UK will set its own TAC, but the country is still expected to participate in wider negotiations regarding sustainable stock management and quota trading. Victoria Prentis, a junior environment minister, said the bill had to 'balance environmental, social and economic needs'. During the four-hour Commons debate she said the bill represented a 'once in a generation chance' to seize control of the country's natural resources and 'sets in stone our commitment to improving the health of our seas'. But campaigners strongly rejected the government's suggestion the bill would 'make sure we pass on healthier seas which are abundant with life,' as Ms Prentis described it. Melissa Moore, of international ocean conservation organisation, Oceana said: 'It's a sad day for UK fisheries as the bill will enable overfishing to continue as there is no deadline or clear duty to fish sustainably.  'This is bad news for fishermen as more stocks will be at risk of collapse, bad news for coastal communities and bad news for the public who love fish suppers.  'This is yet another example of this government getting rid of environmental commitments we had in the EU, in this case a deadline to end overfishing by 2020, and replacing it with something weaker. The UK government's rhetoric that it would develop gold-standard fisheries management is a joke.' The organisation said the bill represented 'the end of the line for sustainable fishing'. Will McCallum, head of oceans at Greenpeace UK, said: 'Despite enormous public and cross-party political support for banning destructive fishing like supertrawlers and bottom trawling from our offshore Marine Protected Areas, the government's ambition remains pitifully weak. Fishing boats over 100 metres long have absolutely no place in so-called protected areas. Just because their nets do not touch the seabed should not mean they are given every right to haul hundreds of tonnes of fish every day from vulnerable habitats.  'If this government is serious about delivering on its promise to be a world leader in ocean protection, then on day one after Brexit it needs to implement an immediate ban on the most destructive forms of fishing throughout our offshore marine protected areas, including supertrawlers and bottom trawlers.' He added: 'This would be an incredible first step towards achieving 30% ocean protection by 2030 as our Prime Minister pledged to do just last week.' ",-0.375,Negative
Brexit: UK will continue trade talks after Boris Johnson's deadline expires,0,Neutral,"The UK will not walk away from Brexit trade talks this week despite the passing of Boris Johnson's deadline, according to a person close to negotiations. Britain's chief negotiator David Frost is expected to advise the prime minister to stay in talks - and tell him it will be difficult but not impossible to get an agreement. Mr Johnson will make the formal decision to continue the process at the end of the week following an EU leaders' summit in Brussels, where heads of government are expected to warn that not enough progress has been made."" Talks have heated up in the last few days, with both sides trading accusations. UK government sources on Tuesday accused the EU of following their standard 'playbook' and trying to 'run down the clock' by not engaging on issues like fishing. But senior EU figures have equally warned that a deal can only be done if Boris Johnson decides he wants to do one. Dacian Ciolos, Emmanuel Macron's top MEP in Brussels, on Monday told The Independent the PM needed to 'step up to the crease'.  The prime minister had previously said he saw little point talking through autumn, and that if there was a deal to be done it would emerge by this week's summit.  Mr Johnson is set to hold one-on-one talks with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen later today. But both sides continue to dig their heels in on the key issues - at least in public. A draft version of the Thursday and Friday summit conclusions on Brexit circulated by Brussels backchannels ahead of the meeting says that ""progress on the key issues of interest to the union is still not sufficient for an agreement to be reached"" Despite steady progress on minor side-issues, two major sticking points remain before a free trade agreement can be reached. The first is the extent to which EU fishing fleets will have access to UK waters, and the second is the so-called 'level-playingfield' of regulations. The UK has in particular refused to play ball on the question of state aid rules, which Downing Street is thought to want more flexibility on than European rules allow. Britain left the EU earlier in 2020 but remains in the single market and customs union until the end of this year. This second 'economic' Brexit is expected to be more noticeable than the first 'political' Brexit - with disruption to trade flows expected whether a deal is reached or not.

"Germany, France call for UK concessions in EU-UK trade talks",-0.125,Negative," Germany and France on Tuesday pressured the United Kingdom to make concessions in three key areas of Brexit trade negotiations or face a no-deal situation as of Jan. 1 which would hit hard a U.K. economy already hurt by the pandemic.  EU negotiator Michel Barnier left negotiations in Brussels to travel to Luxembourg where EU ministers are meeting to debrief on the state of play and make sure the 27 member nations keep a united front, something which they have done ever since the U.K. decided to leave the EU four years ago.  Germany's Europe minister, Michael Roth, stressed that as the deadline to have an outline deal on a basic trade relationship has whittled down to days and weeks instead of months, key priorities still need to be addressed by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.  'Frankly speaking, we are at a very critical stage in the negotiations,"" Roth said. 'Time is running out. That's why we expect substantial progress"" in key areas centering on rules to ensure fair economic competition, legal oversight of any deal and fisheries.  Roth's French counterpart, Clement Beaune, said that particularly on access of U.K. companies to the EU market, the bloc had to be very strict in making sure British firms would not be able to undercut their continental rivals because of minimal regulation and excessive state subsidies.  'Otherwise we would have unfair competition which is not backed by our citizens, companies and workers,"" Beaune said.   Johnson has long billed the two-day EU summit that starts Thursday as an ultimate deadline, while the 27-nation EU is willing to negotiate until early November to craft a deal, however basic.  Since last month, the member states have also become ardent in demanding legal guarantees on governance of any deal since Johnson in September introduced legislation that breaches the Brexit withdrawal agreement he himself signed with the EU only last year.  The EU has said that any agreement will take about two months for legal ratification, translation into the many EU languages and for approval from the EU parliament, making for an effective cutoff date around Nov. 1.  ___ Follow all AP stories on the Brexit trade talks at https://apnews.com/Brexit.

Emmanuel Macron's top ally in Brussels urges Boris Johnson to intervene in Brexit talks,0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson has been urged to intervene in Brexit talks by Emmanuel Macron's top ally in Brussels, amid fears that negotiators have run out of road ahead of a key summit this week. EU officials believe a political intervention is needed to break the deadlock on the biggest issues of fisheries and regulations - where the two sides have barely moved closer since the start of the year. With just a week left of negotiating time, pressure is mounting for a second ""Cheshire moment"" - a reference to when Mr Johnson and former Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar finally broke the deadlock on Brexit talks last year with a private stroll in the gardens of a remote country house. Macron ally Dacian CioloÈ™, the former Romanian prime minister who now leads the French president's liberal ""Renew"" group in the European Parliament, urged the prime minister to ""step up"" and get personally involved. The last few weeks have seen a flurry of activity in London and Brussels, with teams on both sides shuttling back and forth on otherwise empty Eurostar trains during the pandemic. Despite reports of promising progress on side issues, the politically-charged questions of the so-called ""level playing field"" and whether EU fleets will have access to British waters have proven intractable with the current mandates. Adopting a cricket metaphor for the benefit of Mr Johnson, a notable fan of the sport, Macron-ally Mr CioloÈ™ told The Independent: ""A Brexit deal is in everyone's interests, but it can't come at any cost. Time is short, but the British are known for their pragmatism, now it's up to Boris Johnson to decide if he really wants to step up to the crease and clinch this deal."" Brexit will back on the agenda for the first time in months when EU leaders meet on Thursday and Friday in Brussels. Mr Johnson had previously said the UK would walk out of talks if no deal had been done before the meeting, but EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is understood to be pushing for an extension up to the end of the month.   The French president Mr Macron spoke to Mr Johnson himself by telephone over the weekend, where the two sides ""set out the latest state of play in the negotiations"", according to Downing Street.  The prime minister is said to have told Mr Macron that the ""significant gaps"" to be bridged ""in the coming days"" had to be made ""through the process of intensive talks between chief negotiators agreed with the president of the European Commission"" - apparently ruling out a personal intervention.

Britain set to be left without environment watchdog when Brexit transition period ends,-0.125,Negative,"Britain is set to be left without an environment watchdog to replace the EU's at the end of the Brexit transition period, because of government ""dither and delay"" over legislation. Ministers' flagship Environment Bill was supposed to establish a new enforcement structure for environmental regulations in time for the end of December, when EU rules stop applying. But repeated delays to the legislation mean there is no longer enough parliamentary time for the bill to pass into law before 1 January - leaving a gaping chasm in environmental enforcement. Environmental groups said the bill was ""the most important piece of environmental law of the last decade"" and that the delays would likely lead to extra environmental harm.   ""Boris Johnson's government seems to be treating the Environment Bill like an essay crisis,"" said Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK. ""Delaying this vital piece of legislation until the last minute could lead to less scrutiny, fewer chances to improve it and a cliff edge in the environmental safeguards and their enforcement once EU rules no longer apply."" She called for a ""powerful, independent watchdog that can hold ministers' feet to the fire when it comes to protecting the living world"".       After the resumption of parliamentary business in the summer, bills on immigration, trade, pensions, and the Commonwealth Games were all brought back before MPs - but the environment bill has yet to be so. The government has extended the bill's timetable three times, and Labour says the latest schedule means MPs will not be able to give it detailed scrutiny until 1 December - the start of a process that takes months. Luke Pollard, Labour's shadow environment secretary, said: ""The government's dither and delay highlights a worrying lack of focus on the urgent need to protect our environment. We cannot afford any more government incompetence. Ministers need to act now."" The government says it is committed to resuming passage of the bill. A Defra spokesperson said: 'We are committed to a greener future, which is why we are setting ambitious goals for nature and biodiversity in our landmark Environment Bill, as well as introducing new ways to reward farmers for protecting the environment and investing £640m in the Nature for Climate Fund.    Getty  AFP/Getty  Getty  Getty  EPA  Getty  Getty                   'We remain the first major economy to legislate for net zero, and as we build back greener from the coronavirus pandemic we are committed to shaping a cleaner and more resilient society.' The UK left the EU earlier this year, but the Brexit transition period under which all EU rules continue to apply to Britain is set to end on 31 December.

"Brexit: Many small businesses still not ready for leaving EU despite £70m campaign, MPs warned",-0.5,Negative,"Well over a third of small businesses are still not convinced that the UK will transition out of the EU at the end of this year, despite a government information campaign costing £70 million to let them know, MPs have been told. Prime minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly vowed that he will not request an extension to the transition period which ends on 31 December, and is ready to take the UK into a no-deal Brexit if a free trade agreement cannot be reached in that time. But the senior civil servants running the transition project told the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee that many of the 200,000 firms which export to Europe are expected to be 'frustrated' by new red tape which will suddenly be required in the New Year. The UK has deferred some of the additional paperwork until July, but new EU import requirements are expected to be implemented from 1 January. The Cabinet Office's director general of transition, Jess Glover, told the cross-party committee: 'If I'm a small business and I want to export a goods to the EU, I won't be able to do that unless I have built in the import requirements that the EU has in place.  'What will happen to me as that small business is that I won't be able to do the thing that I want to do. I will then learn that I haven't been able to do that thing and I will then, I think, learn that there's something I need to do in order to be able to export my business. But I will have to face that frustration.' Nigel Farage has spent his political career campaigning for the UK to leave the EU.

But he told the committee that, with just 84 days to go, many small businesses still did not expect the transition to go ahead as Mr Johnson has said. Many were preoccupied with the coronavirus crisis and had not turned their minds to the new post-Brexit arrangements, the committee heard. 'When we've been doing polling, we've seen that a number of small businesses - I think it was 43 per cent at the last count -still believed there was going to be an extension at the end of the transition period,' said Mr Chisholm. 'I can understand why they might think that because of the learned behaviour from the previous administration but '¦ there isn't going to be an extension and they really need to be ready for the end of the calendar year in December. 'We've been trying to get that message out very clearly through our public communications through engagement, small business groups, through statements from political leaders, and through our information campaigns.' Mr Chisholm said he believed the figure had since reduced to around 36 per cent - still well over a third of the total. But he said: 'We want to get it right down because it's really important that small businesses are not thinking they can just postpone their preparations, they need to get ready now.''¨The committee was told that companies expecting an extension had 'no motivation or incentive to do anything about getting ready' for the abrupt change in the business environment when the UK leaves EU rules and regulations on 31 December. Businesses will be targeted with campaigns running up to the end of the year to try to persuade them to take action, the MPs heard. ",-0.125,Negative

If there was disruption, would it be the fault of the ports, or the police, or the haulage companies, or the UK or the EU, he was asked. Without missing a beat, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster expressed himself through the words of the heavily-tattooed, deep-voiced singer-songwriter from Sussex. 'If things go wrong, then - to paraphrase Rag'n'Bone Man - put the blame on me,' he told the committee. Fans of Rag'n'Bone Man's 2016 hit Human will know, of course, that he actually urged listeners: 'Don't put your blame on me.' Pedestrians walk pas the Royal Seabank Hotel in Blackpool as Lancashire enters tier 3 of the government's coronavirus alert system Getty A person wearing a face mask is reflected in an art work entitled ""A=V"" by Ben Cullen Williams in Covent Garden, London REUTERS A gallery technician poses next to The Seagram Murals, by artist Mark Rothko during the New Collection Displays photocall at Tate Britain in London Getty Images A red deer stag stands behind females, called hinds, during the rutting (breeding) season which takes place during autumn, in Bushy Park, south west London AP RAF personnel speak to residents in Selly Oak, close to the University of Birmingham, assisting with Birmingham City Council's 'Drop and Collect' coronavirus test distribution, as the local authority attempt to stem the rise of cases in the area PA A member of staff pours a drink in the Richmond pub in Liverpool as Prime Minister Boris Johnson reads a statement on television, as parts of the North of England are bracing themselves for the most stringent Tier 3 control PA Steampunks attend the 'socially distanced' Haworth Steampunk Weekend, in the quiet village in the Pennine hills of West Yorkshire PA Members of the public watch the koi fish in the Kyoto Garden at Holland Park in London.

Boris Johnson news: Brexit deal 'some way off' one week ahead of PM's deadline as Keir Starmer attacks Covid response,0,Neutral,"A Brexit deal is 'some way' away as negotiations on a key obstacle remain fraught, the UK's chief negotiator has said. But Lord Frost added that Britain's door 'would never be closed to a deal' even if Boris Johnson's 15 October deadline is missed. Meanwhile, following talks with Mr Johnson, the European Council president Charles Michel urged Britain to put its 'cards on the table' because although the EU wanted a deal, it would not agree to one if the cost was too high. As difficult as Wednesday was on the Brexit front, coronavirus threw up more challenges still for the government. Earlier, Sir Keir Starmer challenged Mr Johnson over his government's coronavirus testing failures at PMQs, accusing him of 'messing up' his response to the crisis. The Labour leader has also demanded ministers publish scientific evidence for the 10pm pub curfew. In the north of England, regional leaders are in revolt over how local lockdowns have affected their cities. The leaders of Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle city councils have written to the government, arguing its strategy is failing and that they should be put in control.  On a sunnier note, Grant Shapps and Matt Hancock have now created a taskforce designed to reduce the burden of the 14-day quarantine  for travellers to the UK. It will explore how a new testing regime can 'facilitate more Covid-secure travel whilst protecting the population from imported cases'. Johnson faces backlash over Tory conference 'bluster' Boris Johnson is facing business backlash after devoting his Conservative Party conference speech to a rose-tinted vision of the distant future. Labour accused the PM of 'bluster' after he largely ignored the immediate challenges of preventing job losses, while the CBI said the economic crisis showed why No 10 must agree a Brexit trade deal with the EU. Our political editor Andrew Woodcock has more: PM accused of 'bluster' as he sets out vision of life in 2030 Tories spent £16m on election win We now know exactly how much it cost the Conservatives to win the 2019 general election: £16,486,871. Or around £200,000 for every seat won.
 The Electoral Commission have published a comprehensive breakdown of the party's spending - including the £1.6m spent on Lynton Crosby's firm CTF Partners. Another £700,000 was spent on the strategic advisory firm Hanbury Strategy.
 Unite cuts Labour money - and says Starmer 'not listening' It seems Keir Starmer has not been left-wing enough for Unite. The union's executive is cutting the affiliation money it gives to Labour by 10 per cent.   The union, run by Jeremy Corbyn ally Len McCluskey, is angry about the party's new direction - despite recent poll results, which suggest a growing number of people are warming to the party. Starmer and his team were 'just not listening', a union source told the BBC.   McCluskey remains bitter about Labour's decision to pay whistle-blowers who spoke to Panorama about antisemitism, describing it as 'an absolute mistake'.
 Senior Tory urges MPs to join campaign demanding 'life as normal' Top Tory rebel Steve Baker is urging fellow MPs to join a new campaign against the 'irreparable damage' from Covid restrictions - demanding a return to 'life as normal'.
 Launched by academic the US, The Great Barrington Declaration calls instead for 'focused protection' for high-risk people, while the majority are granted full freedoms 'until we reach her immunity'.
 Baker told The Independent it was 'a credible plan B', saying: 'It may be that there won't be a vaccine or, if it comes, it may not do what is hoped. In either case, we need a plan B and this is the only credible plan B, supported by a wide range of specialists in their subjects.' It comes as 14 Tories voted against the 'rule of six' and another dozen abstained, with a larger rebellion expected against the 10pm curfew, set for debate in the Commons next week.
 US-led 'Great Barrington Declaration' attacks 'irreparable damage' from restrictions - calling for 'herd immunity' instead Northern leaders demand control over Covid measures Northern leaders are in revolt over the threat of tougher Covid-19 restrictions - which Boris Johnson is expected to announce within days. Surging infection rates - Manchester's has doubled in a week to more than 500 cases per 100,000 people - are piling pressure on the PM to act. But the leaders of Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle city councils have written to the government, arguing its strategy is failing and that they should be put in control.
 'The existing restrictions are not working, confusing for the public and some, like the 10pm rule, are counter-productive,' the Labour politicians say.
 No 10 is expected to bring in a simplified three-tier 'traffic light' system for regional restrictions in the coming days.
 'We do not support further economic lockdowns,' four city council bosses tell prime minister - as he mulls just that  New restrictions to be announced for Scotland   It's a very big day for Nicola Sturgeon, who is set to announce new coronavirus restrictions for Scots this afternoon in a statement to the Scottish parliament.
 Scotland's first minister has insisted the new measures would not amount to 'another lockdown' - having already ruled out measures such as school closures and Scotland-wide travel restrictions.
 However, there is speculation the SNP leader could shut down bars and restaurants on a temporary basis. Whatever she announces, the new measures are expected to begin this Friday.
 Incidentally, a majority of MSPs at the Scottish parliament seem set to vote against granting legislative consent to the UK Internal Market Bill today - although this will not stop the UK government from pressing ahead with the law-breaking Brexit legislation. Cabinet minister 'deeply uncomfortable' with Covid restrictions Is the government considering a short 'circuit breaker' lockdown?  Cabinet minister Liz Truss has declined to comment on whether the government could bring in a two-week shutdown, but said that all measures were kept under review.
 'We're not going to comment on what future plans could be,' she told Times Radio. 'The whole point is we're keeping this under review and we are making sure that we respond to what's happening on the ground.'  Intriguingly, Truss said she was deeply uncomfortable with Covid restrictions. 'I'm a freedom lover, I would not like to see these restrictions in place in normal circumstances.' The trade secretary gave nothing away either about reported plans for a simplified 'traffic light' system for regional restrictions across England. She told BBC's Breakfast: 'Of course our advisers will be looking at that and telling us what is the appropriate step to take next.' Len McCluskey's intervention: 'Far-left games'? Or standing up for members? Plenty of debate over Unite's decision to cut money given to Labour by 10 per cent - and union boss Len McCluskey's warning to Keir Starmer not to move away from the left. 'Len McCluskey maintains his one-man crusade to ensure perpetual Tory government - what a guy,' tweeted Mike Buckley, head of Labour for a European Future. Former Labour minister Andrew Adonis claims Ernest Bevin 'would have been appalled at the far-left games being played by Len McCluskey while the country goes through this Johnson and Cummings crisis'.
 But Labour activist James Foster retorted: 'It's good to see someone listening to their members, Len McClusky. Well done.'
 'Basic' Brexit trade deal now 'best-case scenario', says Irish minister Ireland's foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney has had some interesting things to say about Brexit this morning. He said a permanent agreement was not possible this year, but the two sides might still agree a basic trade deal. 'It's clear that the best-case scenario is to get a basic trade deal, but that would be a significant achievement,' said Coveney, who said there was more optimism than a few weeks ago. 'There are two obstacles to get that. When the agreement was made, the ambition from both sides was to have a very comprehensive partnership agreement that involved lots of things, including trade on a level playing field.
 'It's quite clear that we are not getting a permanent agreement on those areas '¦ The focus is on that and to get a basic trade deal, but there are two big obstacles and one around the level playing field provisions.'
 Coveney said the second barrier is around fishing. 'You will hear a lot about fishing in the weeks ahead,' he said. 'The position on fishing has hardened on both sides. I don't believe the EU will finalise a future agreement on trade without fishing. These are two very real problems.'
 UK may need 'circuit breaker' lockdown, says Sage scientist A 'circuit breaker' period of tightened restrictions across the UK should be considered to help control the spread of Covid, one of the No 10's scientific advisors has said.
 Making it clear he was speaking in a personal capacity, Calum Semple, from the University of Liverpool, told the BBC that the measure 'would have been a really good idea' a couple of weeks ago.
 'It's always easier to reduce an outbreak at the earlier stage than to let it run and then try to reduce it at a later stage,' the Sage member said. 'So, yes, circuit breakers are certainly something we should be thinking about on a national basis.'

Brexit: UK and EU 'some way from deal' with key talks 'only just beginning',-0.125,Negative,"Talks on the key obstacle to a Brexit agreement are 'only just beginning', the UK's chief negotiator says - warning the two sides are 'some way from a deal'. David Frost revealed a new UK offer to limit future state aid, put forward last week, is 'not an extensive text' and that 'details' will not be produced until next year. 'We are some way from a deal at the moment, if I'm honest,' he told a Lords inquiry - with the date for the UK to crash out of the transition period less than three months' away. Lord Frost also did not deny that vital security data - to target terrorists and organised criminals - will be automatically 'deleted' if it ends in a no-deal Brexit. But he insisted the UK would not shut the door to a deal, even if Boris Johnson's deadline of mid-October is missed, saying: 'Our door would never be closed.' Michael Gove, the prime minister's effective deputy, pointed to tensions as he attacked the portrayal of the EU as 'upholders of virtue' - with the UK as a 'potential rogue'. He admitted the extra red tape for business - even if a deal is reached, outside the single market and customs union - mean there was little difference from a no deal. And he refused to commit to withdrawing the clauses in the Internal Markets Bill that break international law, even if the EU backed down, saying: 'Wait and see.' The comments came as the EU's team arrived in London for fresh talks, due to last until Friday, with more negotiations in Brussels next week, before the EU Council.

"Brexit: No-deal more likely by the day, top EU official says",0.5,Positive," A top European Union official dealing with the United Kingdom said Tuesday that a cliff-edge rupture between the two without even a basic trade deal by the end of the year is becoming more likely by the day.  European Vice President Maros Sefcovic told the European Parliament that 'time is short"" to reach a deal before a Brexit divorce transition period ends by year's end, effectively giving negotiators less than four weeks to broker a deal which must subsequently go through a lengthy approval process. And he pointed his finger at British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for making things even more difficult when he decided last month to introduce a bill that breaches the legally binding Withdrawal Agreement it struck with the bloc to make sure it could leave on Jan. 31. Sefcovic said it made Britain less trustworthy and called the plans ""a heavy blow to the British signature and reliability. Respecting agreements is first a matter of law, but also of trust and in good faith.""  He said the plans left the EU with no choice but to launch legal action against Britain. If passed into law, the Internal Market Bill would undermine the EU's previously agreed oversight of trade to and from Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K and shares a border with EU member Ireland. The bloc is furious that Britain plans to breach portions of the withdrawal treaty that were put in place to maintain an open Irish border, which has underpinned peace since Northern Ireland's 1998 Good Friday accord.  Sefcovic said the EU would never change anything to the Brexit divorce deal.  'The full and timely implementation of the withdrawal agreement is simply not debatable,"" he told the European Parliament.  Under such adversarial conditions, negotiators from both sides continue to look for common ground to broker a rudimentary trade deal to avoid a barrage of uncertainty, tariffs and red tape that would hurt economies on both sides when the transition window ends on Jan. 1. But while negotiators have inched close to agreement in many areas during six months of talks, they remain deadlocked over European fishing boats' access to U.K. waters, and over the level of support governments can give to industry. The EU is concerned that British plans to subsidize sectors such as technology will amount to unfair competition. ",0.125,Positive
No-deal Brexit looms as Boris Johnson says he will quit trade talks unless EU changes approach,0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson has set the UK on course for a no-deal Brexit on 31 December, announcing that he is ready to walk away from talks on a free trade agreement with the EU unless Brussels shows 'a fundamental change of approach'. Although the PM did not explicitly say he was halting negotiations, his official spokesman later told reporters: 'The trade talks are over. The EU have effectively ended them by saying that they do not want to change their negotiating position.' With just 76 days to go to the UK's transition to post-Brexit relations with the EU, the decision sets the scene for the imposition of tariffs on European imports and a huge increase in red tape at Britain's ports. The prime minister was accused of taking a 'hideous gamble with the country's future' as he said it was time for the UK to prepare for an 'Australian-style arrangement' with the EU, which effectively means a no-deal Brexit as Australia has no trade deal with Europe.  The dramatic move came after a two-day European Council summit ended in Brussels without the progress which Mr Johnson last month said was necessary to stay at the negotiating table. However, Brussels made clear that it was not giving up hope of reaching agreement, declaring that chief negotiator Michel Barnier's team will travel to London for talks next week as planned. And European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen held out an olive branch by saying that she wanted talks to 'intensify', following British dismay that this promise was dropped from the official summit conclusions signed by the 27 EU leaders. 'The EU continues to work for a deal, but not at any price,' said Ms von der Leyen. 'As planned, our negotiation team will go to London next week to intensify these negotiations.' But Downing Street said there was 'no point' in Mr Barnier coming to London unless he is 'prepared to discuss all of the issues on the basis of legal texts in an accelerated way without the  UK being required to make all of the moves'.  Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: ""The trade talks are over. The EU have effectively ended them by saying that they do not want to change their negotiating position.  'The EU can either fundamentally change its position or we can leave on Australian terms.' A Treasury forecast in 2018 found that a no-deal Brexit could knock as much as 9.3 per cent off the UK's national income over the next 15 years, compared to 6.7 per cent with a free trade agreement.  Mr Johnson's spokesman was today unable to provide any updated financial analysis, beyond saying that the PM thought the UK would 'thrive'. He declined to comment  whether companies concerned about no-deal Brexit should now trigger any contingency plans they have to move staff and operations out of the UK. But he said he did not think there was 'any reason' for households to start stockpiling supplies of goods which they  fear may run short in the New Year. Business leaders urged Mr Johnson to 'stay at the table and find a route through'. CBI director general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said: 'After four years of negotiations and so many hurdles crossed, this is no time to give up.  'Neither side can afford to fall at the final fence. A deal is the only outcome that protects Covid-hit livelihoods at a time when every job in every country counts.' The chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation said the UK was 'heading into very dangerous territory' with shoppers set to pay 'a heavy price' and industry suffering from delays and disruption at the borders. Calling on leaders on both sides to 'find a way past the current impasse', Ian Wright said: ""In the event of a no-deal Brexit '¦ imported food and drink from the EU will face eye-watering tariffs averaging 18%, kick starting price rises.  ""A no-deal outcome is bad for food and drink businesses, bad for food security, and bad for every household in Great Britain.' Mr Johnson said the EU had 'refused to negotiate seriously' with the UK on its request for a simple free-trade deal guaranteeing zero tariffs and zero quotas, similar to that signed with Canada. Talks have foundered over fundamental differences over fisheries, state and and Brussels' demand for a level playing field on regulation. Mr Johnson said it was clear after this week's two-day summit that the EU was not ready to reach agreement on terms acceptable to the UK. 'From the outset, we were totally clear that we wanted nothing more complicated than a Canada style relationship based on friendship and free trade,' said the PM.  ""To judge by the latest EU summit in Brussels, that won't work for our EU partners. They want the continued ability to control our legislative freedom, our fisheries, in a way that is completely unacceptable to an independent country.  ""And since we have only 10 weeks until the end of the transition period on 1 January, I have to make a judgement about the likely outcome and to get us all ready. ""Given that they have refused to negotiate seriously for much of the last few months and given that this summit appears explicitly to rule out a Canada-style deal, I've concluded that we should get ready for 1 January with arrangements that are more like Australia's based on simple principles of global free trade.  ""And we can do it, because we always knew that there would be changed on 1 January, whatever type of relationship we had.  'And so now is the time for our businesses to get ready and for our hauliers to get ready, for travellers to get ready. And of course we're willing to discuss the practicalities with our friends, where a lot of progress has already been made on such issues as social security, aviation, nuclear co-operation, and so on.' Mr Johnson said that the UK could approach the end of the transition period 'with high hearts and with complete confidence'. Despite most economists believing that a no-deal Brexit will deal a heavy blow to the UK's GDP, Mr Johnson claimed that ""we will prosper mightily as an independent free trading nation controlling our own borders, our fisheries and setting our own laws'. Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson Christine Jardine said: ""Boris Johnson's handling of Brexit has been disastrous and these reckless comments are just further evidence of the prime minister's incompetence. 'At a time when the UK is already facing the biggest crisis in generations as a result of coronavirus, we cannot afford to crash out of the EU without a deal in place or to accept a rushed, bad deal. The government cannot allow people's livelihoods to be put further at risk, when so many are already struggling to get by.' The chief executive of the Best for Britain campaign against a no-deal Brexit, Naomi Smith, said: 'The Prime Minister was elected on a promise to secure a trade deal with the EU. To be clear, the EU has not abandoned the idea of a free trade deal with us and it would be the Prime Minister's decision to abandon these talks. 'Without a deal, tariffs would destroy the competitiveness of many UK industries, meaning the current economic crisis will cut deeper into people's lives. 'At the same time the government readily admits that most businesses are not prepared for no-deal. They don't have the cash reserves to make the necessary changes and the government still hasn't put in place the correct customs infrastructure. 'The EU has signalled its desire to carry on talks. Walking away now would be a hideous gamble with the country's future.' ",0.125,Positive
Brexit: What happens if we have no deal?,0,Neutral,"The threat of no-deal Brexit looms over the UK once again, with Boris Johnson having gone to the wire in talks to secure a free trade agreement with the European Union. Mr Johnson told his cabinet this week that leaving the EU without a deal should hold 'no fear' for Britain, but was he right?  What would be the effects of a no-deal exit? In September, Michael Gove set out what the government considered the 'reasonable worst-case scenario' even if a deal is struck by year's end. Whitehall concluded that up to 70 per cent of lorries travelling to the EU may not be ready for new, third-country border controls imposed by Europe. Freight flow could fall to less than two-thirds of normal, creating 7,000-vehicle queues in Kent lasting for two days due to lack of holding capacity. Government assumptions about the easing of what it called 'sustained disruption' after three months rely partly on France relaxing border checks, or increasing its capacity to carry them out. Many businesses, including the vast majority of smaller ones, will not be ready for the end of the transition period on 31 December, planners concluded. Experts think such a worst-case scenario is more likely to materialise if there is no deal, and French border authorities see no reason to co-operate with the British. Senior health figures are still raising concerns about the potential interruptions to medicine supply with just weeks until the transition period ends - particularly given the pressure heaped on the NHS by coronavirus. Layla McCay, international director of the NHS Confederation, wrote in The Independent this month: 'The UK and EU should not underestimate the foreseen and unforeseen challenges that will arise in less than 100 days for patients should a free trade deal not be reached. Covid-19 has already put the health and care workforce, the pharmaceutical industry and patient groups under immense strain, the exacerbating effect of failing to agree a free trade agreement could see it snap.' On Wednesday night the Nuffield Trust, a leading health think-tank, warned that medical supplies needed to fight the second wave of coronavirus may also be hit by no-deal Brexit. The trust added that medical equipment imports from the EU had reached an all-time high this year. In 2019 the Department of Health announced its intention to buy in an 'express freight service' to transport small medical consignments to the UK in the event of no deal. It has also been stockpiling medical devices, blood, supplies for clinical trials and more. A new tariff regime will come in overnight on 1 January as the UK begins trading on World Trade Organisation terms. Plans announced by Liz Truss, the trade secretary, earlier this year would see prices of items like wine, cheese and pasta sourced from the EU rise significantly. And a 10-per-cent tariff on imported European cars could add thousands of pounds to their cost.
 Minced beef, cucumbers, lettuce and other items may also rise in price.
 According to the government, its tariffs will apply to all imports except those from countries with which Britain has a free trade agreement. The British Retail Consortium claimed in an analysis in September that supermarket shoppers would pay £1.3bn a year more on groceries. It warned that a no-deal Brexit would have 'a massive impact' on the finances of people on low pay. British exporters like car manufacturers and fishermen are expected to take a serious hit as well. A government economic analysis published in November 2018 suggested that no-deal Brexit could cause GDP to fall by as much as 9 per cent over the next 15 years relative to where it would otherwise have been. The document obviously could not have foreseen the coronavirus pandemic, and in any case is full of caveats and hedges due to the difficulty of modelling future economies.
 However, just this week, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned that failing to clinch a trade agreement could dent the UK's economy by 6.5 per cent in the coming years, and put at risk its recovery from the damage Covid-19 has already inflicted. Police, spies and even government ministers have been warning for years that no-deal Brexit will cut off the UK from many key tools used to fight international crime. Likewise, European investigators' partnerships with their British colleagues will be damaged. Britain needs to negotiate a new security treaty with the EU to maintain access to bodies such as Europol, powers including the European Arrest Warrant and vital policing and intelligence databases. Senior police officers have warned that the loss of EU tools could create a public safety risk by allowing suspects to abscond and making it harder to extradite foreign nationals. Officers forced to use outdated conventions would spend hours in stations negotiating red tape, and the change will cost forces at least £20m extra a year. In November 2018, then-security minister (now defence secretary) Ben Wallace warned: 'A no-deal situation would have a real impact on our ability to work with our European partners to protect the public."" And in October last year, the former head of MI5 said he could not see 'any security upside from Brexit', even with a deal. ""It's hard to imagine that we will be in quite such a good place after Brexit but we need to do our best to compensate for any deficit,"" Lord Evans said. The withdrawal agreement that Boris Johnson's government negotiated with the EU included a 'protocol' designed to protect peace in Northern Ireland, as enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement. Northern Ireland has the UK's only land border with the EU, and under the protocol will stick to European rules on goods. In order to maintain peace along the border with the Republic of Ireland and, in particular, avoid a so-called 'hard border' with infrastructure that might become a target and recruiting tool for terrorists, the two sides agreed that necessary paperwork would be carried out on goods arriving in Northern Ireland from England, Wales or Scotland, rather than at the Irish land border. The plan would allow Brussels to trust that goods entering NI which might later cross the porous frontier into the Republic met its standards. However, if Westminster fails to secure a Brexit deal, that regulatory border in the Irish Sea would become one across which tariffs would have to be paid, cleaving the UK's internal market in two. Into this fraught situation Mr Johnson has introduced his internal market bill, which seeks to allow goods to be traded on even terms between all four UK nations. However, the controversial measure would allow ministers to rewrite the rules previously enshrined in the withdrawal agreement, including on the movement of goods in Northern Ireland. It could mean that the EU feels it necessary to implement checks on the Irish land border - the very scenario the protocol was designed to prevent. UK MPs have warned MI5 that a hard border would increase the terror threat. Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, admitted the bill would breach international law and it has drawn widespread criticism. Nonetheless, MPs have passed it and it awaits a final vote in the House of Lords. Without going so far as to invoke Murphy's Law - 'whatever can go wrong, will go wrong' - it is important to note the possibility that unintended consequences may arise from a no-deal Brexit. Will the Northern Ireland situation jeopardise a trade deal with the US? (Both the Trump administration and Joe Biden have expressed concerns over the internal market bill.) Will Scottish independence rear its head again? (A poll found a majority in favour of secession this week.) Still more unknown possibilities surely abound. ",-0.125,Negative

It comes as figures show the economy grew by only 2.1 per cent in August - far below what was expected and a dramatic slow down in the recovery. Rishi Sunak to announce local furlough scheme We are expecting the chancellor announcement of local support measures for workers in pub and restaurants forced to close under fresh coronavirus restrictions expected to come in next week. The new scheme will see workers paid two-thirds of their wages until businesses are allowed to reopen, according to The Times. That will not quite be enough to satisfy union demands that the treasury match the 80 per cent rate of the original furlough scheme - but does go further than Sunak's wage support measures announced at the end of September. Treasury says measures will 'provide a safety net for those businesses that may have to close in the coming weeks and months' One-third of infections spreading through pubs, says minister Almost one-third of all coronavirus infections are spreading through pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues, business minister Nadhim Zahawi has said. Evidence presented to MPs showed some 30 per cent of all Covid-19 cases are being contracted through visits to venues such as pubs and restaurants, Mr Zahawi told the BBC on Friday morning.

EU chief negotiator in London for 'intensified' Brexit talks   The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier is in London today for talks with UK counterpart Lord Frost - with less than a week before Boris Johnson's self-imposed deadline to reach a trade agreement.
 The PM's official spokesman said that following the conclusion of talks on Friday they would resume in Brussels 'early next week'.
 Despite the urgency in trying to reach some form of breakthrough before the EU Council summit, there are no plans for the negotiators to continue discussions over the weekend.
 The No 10 spokesman said: 'We have been perfectly clear about the need to work towards the 15 October European Council. The EU has agreed to intensified talks, those have been taking place this week and you will see more of them next week.'
 UK's economic recovery slows down dramatically The UK economy grew by only 2.1 per cent in August as the recovery from lockdown slowed - despite Rishi Sunak's Eat Out to Help Out scheme, official figures show.
 The latest monthly GDP estimate, which came in well below 4.6 per cent growth forecast by analysts, will cause great concern for the chancellor.
 It came after a 6.6 per cent increase in output in July. The slowdown means the economy remains 9.2 per cent below its peak reached before the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics reported.
 GDP remains 9.2 per cent below February's peak, despite Eat Out to Help Out scheme Media leaks on Covid curbs becoming 'corrosive', says minister Business minister Nadhim Zahawi has been trying to put a brave face on those new figures on GDP showed a struggling economy.   'This is a really tough year economically,' he told BBC's Breakfast. 'Undoubtedly 2020 is going to be a difficult year. The direction of travel is still positive, it's still over 2% growth.' The minister refused to confirm government plans for new restrictions expected to come in next week - widely briefed to the media - and said 'leaks' to newspapers were becoming 'corrosive'. Zahawi told Sky News: 'This is really bad that people are leaking this stuff and I hope that whoever's doing this will stop because actually it's counterproductive, it's confusing and it's corrosive.'
 Asked about a £3,000 pay rise for MPs, Zahawi said he would consider donating it to a charity in his constituency. Manchester mayor wants existing furlough scheme to be extended Will Rishi Sunak's scheme go far enough for leaders in the north? The chancellor's new scheme, set to be announced today, will see workers paid two-thirds of their wages until businesses are allowed to reopen, according to The Times. But Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has warned 'the damage to the economy of the month will be deep and lasting' if the government does not extend the furlough scheme in full. Reacting to the news that 465 jobs are set to be lost at Manchester Airport, he tweeted: 'The government's line is that these jobs are 'not viable'. I say that they are.'
 Government 'striking red pen' through northern economy, says Labour Labour's shadow business minister Lucy Powell has spoken of 'fury' in the north over coronavirus curbs set to come in next week - and the lack of clarity about how, why and when they will be imposed. 'There's a huge amount of frustration, and frankly fury, up here in the north at the way we are being treated by this government,' she told BBC's Breakfast. 'They seem to be sitting in offices in Whitehall, striking a red pen through large swathes of our economy and our society.' Powell also told Sky News she fears new local furlough payments 'won't be sufficient' to help affected workers, and called on the government to resume giving cash grants for businesses 'as a matter of urgency'.
 Large parts of the north of England are expected to be placed in the highest tier when the government's new, three-tier traffic light system is rolled out. Barnier 'tells officials Brexit talks must continue until end of October'   Brace yourself for a wild ride on the Brexit rollercoaster: the rhetorical games are about to get intense over the next few weeks.   EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has reportedly told a meeting of European ambassadors that a trade deal is now close, but cannot be done any time too soon.   The negotiations will have to continue beyond next week's big EU Council summit because national leaders will be too be edgy to agree on any compromises during the summit itself, according to The Times. The newspaper says a confidential briefing note also shows Barnier has warned EU leaders - including Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron - not to react to any of Boris Johnson's efforts to turn the summit into a deadline.
 Barnier's team is said to be worried the French president is especially defensive about potential concessions on fishing rights right now. 'Macron is on a short fuse,' said one anonymous official. Pay rise for MPs? 'Insult' to the public, says campaign group The business secretary Nadhim Zahawi's claim he is considering giving his £3,000 pay rise to charity has sparked renewed interest in MPs' salary bump.
 The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) has said next year's pay would be based on public sector year-on-year three-month growth figure of 4.1 per cent - meaning an extra £3,360 for MPs.
 Jeremy Hutton of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'IPSA must be tin-eared if it really thinks a pay rise for MPs should be considered this year '¦ A pay rise in parliament would be an insult to hardworking taxpayers who've had a very tough year.' No-deal Brexit would spark 'fair degree of chaos', says Tory MP Sir Roger Gale has been talking about his fears if the government cannot reach a trade deal agreement with the EU this autumn.
 The Tory MP for North Thanet say fellow members from Kent 'are very concerned about the potential impact upon freight traffic across the channel'.
 He told Sky News: 'If there is no deal - it's going to be bad enough if there is - without a deal I think we are facing a fair degree of chaos after 31 December.'
 Sir Roger said Boris Johnson's Internal Market Bill - which commits the UK to breaking key parts of last year's withdrawal agreement - had not helped the negotiations.

Brexit: Time running out for deal as EU hints Boris Johnson's deadline may need to flex,0,Neutral,"EU and UK negotiators will get back to the negotiating table next week in Brussels, ahead of Boris Johnson's deadline to get a free trade agreement and avert a no-deal Brexit. The prime minister had said he wants an agreement secured by the European Council summit on Thursday and Friday of next week, and threatened to walk away if none is secured - but progress has been scarce so far. Despite some agreement on side issues like social security cooperation and human rights, the biggest sticking points - fishing access and the so-called 'level playing field for regulations' - are as far away as ever. Downing Street said there had been 'useful discussions' in informal talks this week, but the prime minister's spokesperson emphasised that there were still big differences on 'important issues'. It comes amid reports that Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator has told member states that while a deal is possible, one is unlikely to be worked out in time for next week's summit. The EU has also emphasised time pressure throughout the process, citing the need for several months to consider and ratify any agreement struck. But the European parliament, the EU institution most keenly aware of the time pressures because of its central role in ratification, has said it could work with an agreement that arrived by the end of the month. That difference in deadline of two weeks is likely to prove crucial and may present a window of opportunity for a deal.    The Times reports that Mr Barnier has told EU diplomats that negotiations could continue until the end of the month, rather than stopping at the end of this week. The event would not be a surprise, given the Brexit process since 2016 has been characterised by constantly slipping and postponed deadlines. Mr Barnier visited London on Friday for informal discussions. 'We have had useful discussions this week,' the prime minister's spokesperson told journalists in Westminster. 'Progress has been made in some areas, however there still remains differences on some important issues but we remain committed to trying to agree an FTA [free trade agreement]. 'We continue to want an agreement, we continue to want an FTA but it is important that we can agree on some issues.' Mr Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen agreed last weekend to intensify talks. Speaking in Dublin on Thursday, the European Council president Charles Michel said it was up to the UK to put its cards on the table.

Brexit news - live: Farmers make final plea over chlorinated chicken as Tony Blair denies breaching quarantine,-0.125,Negative,"The National Farmers' Union has called on parliament to adopt an amendment to the Agriculture Bill which they say will protect UK food standards in future trade deals. Peers had suggested the change - which was voted down in the Commons last week - which would have required agricultural and food imports to meet domestic standards amid warnings over chlorinated chicken or hormone-treated beef entering the UK market from the US. Meanwhile, Tony Blair has denied claims he breached coronavirus quarantine restrictions by failing to self-isolate for 14 days upon returning to the UK from a trip to the US. The former UK prime minister was pictured at a London restaurant some 10 days after returning from Washington last month, the Sunday Telegraph reports. No-deal Brexit 'would not be a picnic' Over on the Andrew Marr Show, Michael Gove admitted a no-deal Brexit would not 'be a picnic'.  Even though he said he would prefer to leave the EU with a free trade agreement, the Tory MP said the UK was 'ready if required to leave on what have been called Australian terms.'  'It could be called Mongolian or Afghan terms as well as Australian, Andrew Marr butted in.  An Australian-style arrangement effectively means a no-deal Brexit, as Australia has no trade deal with Europe.

Additional reporting by PA Our Whitehall editor, Kate Devlin, reported on MPs overturning the amendment to the Agriculture Bill at the time:  Amid growing Tory rebellion Farmers make plea over food standards amendment The National Farmers' Union has called on parliament to adopt an amendment to the Agriculture Bill which they say will protect UK food standards in future trade deals. The government won a vote in the Commons last week to reject the House of Lords amendment to the bill which would have required agricultural and food imports to meet domestic standards. The National Farmers' Union president, Minette Batters, wrote in the Mail on Sunday: ""I hope that parliament will, next week, put the Agriculture Bill to bed, accept Lord Curry's amendment to strengthen the Trade and Agriculture Commission, provide a legal basis from which to operate and give MPs the role in agreeing our future trade deals."" Boris Johnson spoke to Ms Batters after the government won the vote last week and made ""a cast-iron commitment not to undermine Britain's farmers in trade deals"", she added. Peers suggested the amendment to block the import of foodstuffs produced abroad with lower animal welfare standards, amid warnings over chlorinated chicken or hormone-treated beef entering the UK market from the US.

His remarks were followed by a statement from his official spokesperson: 'Trade talks are over. The EU effectively ended them by saying they do not want to change their negotiating position.' It comes as German chancellor Angela Merkel said both sides would have to make concessions.

They are continuing to resist pressure from the PM to accept the highest level of coronavirus restrictions. Regional mayor Andy Burnham and council leaders wrote: ""At our last meeting with Downing Street officials yesterday morning, we were told they would arrange a further meeting later in the day to provide a response to our requests.
 ""That did not happen and, despite being on standby all day today, we are still waiting for it to be arranged. We can assure the prime minister that we are ready to meet at any time to try to agree a way forward. ""We can also say with confidence that we have done, and will continue to do, everything within our power to protect the health of our residents, including being the first area in the country to agree to local restrictions back in July.
 ""We are not convinced that closing hospitality venues is the only way to protect hospitals and we want to look at other measures, such as reinstating shielding arrangements and introducing tougher instant closure powers on non-compliant pubs, restaurants, shops and other business premises.
 ""We firmly believe that protecting health is about more than controlling the virus, and requires proper support for people whose lives would be severely affected by a Tier-3 lockdown.
 ""We do not believe that the current proposals provide adequate support and that is why we await further talks.""
 Scientific adviser warns Boris Johnson action to beat Covid-19 must be 'fast and hard' Boris Johnson's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has issued a warning that action against coronavirus must be 'fast and hard' to get the disease under control, writes Andrew Woodcock.

Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said leaving the EU without a deal would have a ""devastating"" impact on the motor industry, hitting the economy and jobs in every region of the country.

Brexit: Boris Johnson could walk out of talks as early as Friday as no-deal looms,-0.125,Negative,"Boris Johnson will decide after the conclusion of a crunch EU summit on Friday whether to press ahead with trade negotiations with the EU or walk away with no deal, Downing Street has said. The announcement amounts to an admission that Mr Johnson has missed his self-imposed deadline of 15 October to seal a deal, and that there will be no breakthrough in talks with the presidents of the European Commission and European Council this evening. A source close to the talks has said that UK chief negotiator David Frost will advise Mr Johnson to stay at the table in the hope of a deal before the transition to post-Brexit arrangements on 31 December. But it is understood that the PM wants to take account of the conclusions of this week's European Council and the tone taken by EU leaders at the summit on Thursday and Friday before deciding on how to take the Brexit process forward. The prime minister said in September that he saw little point talking through autumn, and that if there was a deal to be done it would emerge by this week's summit.  The PM's official spokesman said: ""Some progress has been made this week, primarily in technical areas of the negotiations. ""But there are still differences, with fisheries being the starkest. We need to get substance settled and not having a common text to work from has made progress doubly difficult 'The prime minister's 7 September statement was very clear about the significance of 15 October. He will need to take a decision on next steps following the European Council in the light of his conversation with President (Ursula) von der Leyen, and on advice from his negotiating team. I cannot prejudge what that decision will be.' It is understood that the UK side have been pushing to intensify talks over the last few weeks to make the final push for an agreement, and have been frustrated by what they see as a lack of ambition from Brussels. A particular bone of contention has been the EU's refusal to discuss legal texts of the agreement which both sides have said they want to reach by the end of 2020 - less than 80 days away. Talks have heated up in the last few days, with both sides trading accusations. UK government sources on Tuesday accused the EU of following their standard 'playbook' and trying to 'run down the clock' by not engaging on issues like fishing. But senior EU figures have equally warned that a deal can only be done if Boris Johnson decides he wants to do one. Dacian Ciolos, Emmanuel Macron's top MEP in Brussels, on Monday told The Independent the PM needed to 'step up to the crease'.  With both sides digging their heels in, publicly at least, there was little expectation of any breakthrough in Mr Johnson's talks with Ms von der Leyen and Council president Charles Michel this evening. A draft version of the summit conclusions on Brexit circulated by Brussels backchannels ahead of the meeting says that ""progress on the key issues of interest to the union is still not sufficient for an agreement to be reached"" Despite steady progress on minor side-issues, two major sticking points remain before a free trade agreement can be reached. The first is the extent to which EU fishing fleets will have access to UK waters, and the second is the so-called 'level playing field' of regulations. The UK has in particular refused to play ball on the question of state aid rules, where Downing Street is thought to want more flexibility than European rules allow. Britain left the EU in January but remains in the single market and customs union until the end of this year. This second 'economic' Brexit is expected to be more noticeable than the first 'political' Brexit - with disruption to trade flows expected whether a deal is reached or not. ",0,Neutral
Brexit: Government spends £80m on ferries in hope of seeing off threat to medical supplies,0.125,Positive,"The government has been forced to spend almost £80m of taxpayers' money on hiring ferries in the hope of avoiding disruption to vital medical supplies caused by Brexit at the end of 2020.

A previous government attempt to secure additional ferry capacity ended in fiasco last year, when then transport secretary Chris Grayling was forced to cancel a contract with a company with no boats, paid £50m to others for terminating arrangements despite no services being provided and was sued for £33m by Eurotunnel after it was frozen out of the scheme. But Mr Shapps insisted that the new contracts would ensure the 'smooth and successful' flow of critical freight despite the disruption expected to be caused by Brexit. He said they were negotiated under the 'freight capacity framework' introduced after the earlier ferry farce, under which only experienced freight operators can bid for contracts and termination costs are limited to 'a fraction of the full contract amount'.   'As the transition period comes to an end, we are putting the necessary measures in place to safeguard the smooth and successful flow of freight,' said Mr Shapps.  'Securing these contracts ensures that irrespective of the outcome of the negotiations, lifesaving medical supplies and other critical goods can continue to enter the UK from the moment we leave the EU.' But Best for Britain chief executive Naomi Smith said: 'Given the government's last ferry contracts ended in a court battle, many will rightly question whether this is the best way to ensure vital medical supplies and other critical goods can be smoothly delivered to the UK after the transition period ends. 'Supply chains are already experiencing unprecedented levels of disruption due to Covid and a no-deal Brexit could create huge new logistical problems for medicine suppliers and those relying on them, particularly given how late these arrangements have been made. 'With time and money now in very short supply, the government would do well to channel its energy into securing an agreement with the EU to prevent the possibility of shortages in the new year.' ",0,Neutral
Conservative conference: Boris Johnson says Britain cannot go back to 'old normal' after coronavirus,-0.125,Negative,"Boris Johnson was hit by a business backlash after devoting a major speech to a rose-tinted vision of the distant future, rather than offering solutions to the expected wave of Covid-driven job losses and the impending threat of a no-deal Brexit.  Business groups welcomed the prime minister's promises to invest in wind-power and infrastructure and to rely on the private sector to deliver a boost to national productivity once the pandemic is over.  But they warned that companies need immediate help to get them through a 'precarious' period ahead, when chancellor Rishi Sunak's support for workers through the furlough scheme is withdrawn on 1 November and the UK switches to post-Brexit trading relations with the EU on 31 December.  Labour accused the PM of 'bluster' after he largely ignored the immediate challenges of preventing job losses and scaling up coronavirus testing to instead focus on his hopes for a Britain of hydrogen-powered trains and zero-carbon jets in 2030.  In his keynote speech to the Conservative Party's virtual annual conference, Mr Johnson said that the end of the pandemic must not mean a return to the normality of 2019,  but should usher in an 'acceleration of social and economic change' to deliver a 'bright future' in a decade's time. The prime minister promised to press ahead with manifesto plans to introduce long-term fixed-rate mortgages on 5 per cent deposits to reverse the 'disgraceful' decline in home-ownership among the under-40s over the past decade.

And he pledged to invest £160m in wind turbine manufacturing to help the UK become 'the world leader in low-cost, clean power generation', with offshore wind powering every home in the country by 2030. But there was little flesh on the bones of his pledges, and business groups raised concerns about the imminent crisis facing many firms. CBI director general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said: ""Too many firms are overwhelmed by the enormity of the Covid impact on their cashflow and confidence. Government can act today to show a clear and consistent rationale on restrictions, delivering targeted help as the virus' impact evolves, and ramping up mass testing for the critical months ahead.  ""And there's no avoiding the importance of delivering a new trade agreement with the EU for our economy.' The British Chambers of Commerce welcomed the PM's commitment to invest in clean, renewable energy. But director general Adam Marshall said: 'Businesses continue to face challenges in the here and now, and the economy remains on a knife-edge. The prime minister must take similarly bold measures to support jobs and improve the test and trace system to shore up business confidence in the months ahead.'  And the Institute of Directors' Roger Barker said that, while business leaders would  welcome the PM's vow to put 'wind in the sails of enterprise', they were also ""acutely aware of the precarious state of the economy, with the impending end of the furlough scheme and the conclusion of the Brexit transition period'. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: 'We have an unemployment crisis '“ with more job losses being announced every day. Yet this reality was missing from Boris Johnson's sunny speech.' Setting out his plans to 'build back better' after the Covid crisis, Mr Johnson said: 'After all we have been through it isn't enough just to go back to normal. We have lost too much. We have mourned too many.   'We have been through too much frustration and hardship just to settle for the status quo ante '“ to think that life can go on as it was before the plague; and it will not."" History showed that events like wars, famines and plagues 'are more often than not the trigger for an acceleration of social and economic change', he said.  Rather than contenting themselves with 'a repair job' after such catastrophes, people tend to see them as 'a time to learn and to improve on the world that went before'. The PM said that the UK was suffering from 'chronic underlying problems' even before the virus struck, with poor skills, inadequate transport infrastructure, insufficient homes and 'far too many people'¦ who felt ignored and left-out'. 'We cannot now define the mission of this country as merely to restore normality,' he said. 'That isn't good enough.' Mr Johnson effectively admitted that he had been wrong to scoff at green energy, claiming that 'some people 20 years ago said that it wouldn't pull the skin off a rice pudding'. However the phrase was in fact used by Mr Johnson himself seven years ago in 2013, when he was Mayor of London.  Reeling off previous pledges to build or renovate 48 hospitals,  improve road and rail links, recruit 50,000 nurses and 20,000 police officers and 'fix the injustice of care home funding', Mr Johnson said: 'We are resolving not to go back to 2019 but to do better.' And he said that the key to a more prosperous future was to 'raise the overall productivity of the country'. He compared the situation to 1942, when a wartime government prepared to build a 'new Jerusalem' when peace returned. In the event, the war was followed by the creation of the NHS and modern welfare state by Clement Attlee's Labour government, after they ousted Churchill's Conservatives in the 1945 election. Mr Johnson rejected the argument that the failings of  the private sector-led test and trace system meant that the public sector should drive the UK's rebuilding after the pandemic. He said that the tough lockdown restrictions  and the massive taxpayer support provided by chancellor Rishi Sunak went against Conservative 'instincts' but were adopted because there was 'no reasonable alternative'. Maintaining high state spending after the pandemic would lead to 'disaster', he warned, adding: 'We must be clear that there comes a moment when the state must stand back and let the private sector get on with it'¦ 'We must build back better by becoming more competitive, both in tax and regulation.' The PM also took a 'culture war' swipe at Labour, saying: 'We are proud of this country's culture and history and traditions '“ they literally want to pull statues down, to rewrite the history of our country, to edit our national CV to make it look more politically correct.' And he claimed that an unidentified 'they' were 'secretly scheming to overturn Brexit and take us back into the EU'. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said Mr Johnson had offered 'bluster' in place of a plan to deal with the country's immediate challenges.  ""The British people needed to hear the prime minister set out how he and his government will get a grip of the crisis,' said Ms Rayner. 'We end this Conservative conference as we started it: with a shambolic testing system, millions of jobs at risk and an incompetent government that has lost control of this virus and is holding Britain back.' The Scottish National Party's leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, said: ""The prime minister offered absolutely nothing to the millions of people who stand to lose their jobs, and see their incomes slashed, as a result of Tory cuts to the furlough scheme and the reckless decision to impose an extreme Brexit in the middle of a pandemic.' And Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""The prime minister's speech utterly failed to deliver a credible plan to beat coronavirus. With the government's tracing system in meltdown, a quarter of the UK in lockdown and millions set to face unemployment, this speech was nothing more than a pipe dream.  'People and business need not only reassurance from the prime minister, but concrete measures to help them face the next six months of this pandemic. They got neither.' ",0,Neutral
Angela Merkel says EU will also have to compromise to reach Brexit trade deal,0.25,Positive,"The European Union will also have to make compromises if a Brexit trade deal is to be signed, Angela Merkel has said. In a rare intervention aimed at cooling tensions over stalling negotiations, the German chancellor said it would not just be down to the UK to change its position. Her comments come after EU leaders issued a statement saying it was for the UK to 'make the necessary moves to make an agreement possible' - angering the government in London. UK chief negotiator David Frost on Thursday night said he was ""disappointed"" at the tone struck by the European Council, and ""surprised"" by the suggestion that to get an agreement ""all future moves must come from UK"". Lord Frost, who was recently enobled by Boris Johnson, said the EU's statement was ""an unusual approach to conducting a negotiation"". Boris Johnson is set to make a decision later on Friday about whether to accept an offer by the EU to extend talks until the end of the month. The PM had previously said today's summit was his final deadline and that there was little point in talking about the issue into the autumn - but has since suggested the decision has not yet been made on whether to walk out.  Speaking on the doorstep of the Thursday and Friday summit, Ms Merkel told reporters: 'In some places things have moved well, in other places there is still a lot of work to be done.  'We have asked the United Kingdom to remain open to compromise, so that an agreement can be reached. This of course means that we, too, will need to make compromises.' The three major intractable issues remaining are the question of fishing rights, governance, and a level playing field in regulations, particularly around state aid. Of these, fishing has seen the least progress, though EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has previously hinted the EU is willing to compromise.

UK chides EU but says gaps to Brexit trade deal are narrow,0.125,Positive," Britain's foreign minister said Friday that there are only narrow differences remaining in trade talks between the U.K. and the European Union, but insisted the bloc must show more 'flexibility' if it wants to make a deal  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce whether he will make good on his threat to walk away from the talks a deal was not struck by the first day of the EU summit, which was Thursday. An agreement remains elusive, and EU leaders said in a joint statement that it was now up to the U.K. ""to make the necessary moves to make an agreement possible.' U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Britain was disappointed by the bloc's tone. 'There is a deal to be done but there needs to be flexibility on both sides,' he told the BBC. 'It feels a little bit lacking from the European Union.' Raab said differences remained on only two issues: EU boats' access to U.K. fishing waters, and 'level playing field' rules to ensure fair economic competition between Britain and the bloc. 'The issues are really narrow now,' Raab said.  Britain left the EU's political structures on Jan. 31 and will make an economic break when a transition period ends Dec. 31. The two sides are trying to strike a rudimentary free trade deal and avoid a 'no-deal' exit that would hit business and jobs on both sides and compound the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic. But months of talks have ground to a halt on the issues of fishing '” highly symbolic for maritime nations on both sides '” and rules to ensure common regulatory standards and fair competition. The EU fears the U.K. will gain an unfair advantage by slashing food, workplace and environmental standards and pumping state money into businesses once it is free of the bloc's rules. London took umbrage at the EU's tone late Thursday, with chief U.K. negotiator David Frost tweeting that he was surprised by the 'suggestion that to get an agreement all future moves must come from U.K. It's an unusual approach to conducting a negotiation.'  German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the veteran diplomat, sought to soothe tempers, saying that 'we asked Britain to be willing to compromise. This of course means that we too have to make compromises.' Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier signalled he expected the talks to continue. 'The negotiations aren't over,' he said. adding that his team would be London-bound for more talks next week and planned to host negotiations in Brussels the week after that. Britain has not publicly agreed to that timetable. He also insisted that EU negotiators 'are prepared to speed up negotiations,' countering Frost who said in a tweet: 'Surprised EU is no longer committed to working 'intensively' to reach a future partnership.'  Trust between the two sides, already frayed by years of Brexit acrimony, took a nosedive last month when Johnson introduced legislation that breaches parts of the withdrawal agreement he himself signed with the EU only last year.  The European Parliament, which must approve any deal, has vowed not to approve any trade deal if the U.K. government doesn't withdraw this legislation. Britain says the bill, which has yet to become law, is needed as an insurance policy in case the EU behaves unreasonably after Brexit. ___ Raf Casert reported from Brussels. ",-0.5,Negative
EU offers Boris Johnson two-week extension to Brexit trade talks,-0.125,Negative,"Boris Johnson is facing the momentous decision of whether to walk out on Brexit trade talks, after the EU offered to extend them beyond the prime minister's deadline to the end of October. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier told reporters in Brussels that he had proposed a two-week extension to negotiations, offering to work through the weekend if necessary to get an agreement. 'I can confirm that we're available, we shall remain available until the last possible day,' he said, after a meeting of EU leaders in the Belgian capital to discuss the issue. 'The negotiations aren't over, we want to give these negotiations every chance of being successful to give every chance of agreement.' The prime minister, who would trigger a no-deal Brexit if he decides to refuse the offer, this week said he would wait for the conclusions of the summit before making a decision about whether to extend on Friday. He faces the choice amid a growing revolt at home over his handling of the Covid-19 crisis, and with early signs that a second wave of the pandemic is about to hit the UK. But a statement prepared by EU leaders after their discussion gave no hint of compromise, and was even downgraded from an earlier draft that promised 'intensified' discussions, in case the wrong message was sent. To hammer the point home, the leaders said it was up to the UK to change its position. 'As of tomorrow I will be speaking with my counterpart David Frost [the UK chief negotiator],' Mr Barnier told reporters. 'On Monday we'll be in London for the full week, including the weekend if necessary, the following week in Brussels. 'That's what I have proposed to the British team to negotiate in the short space of time still left to us, so that we can negotiate this agreement through to the end of October.' Lord Frost, the UK's chief negotiator, said he was 'disappointed' by the outcome of the summit. He had previously been expected to advise the prime minister to extend discussions. [I'm] surprised by the suggestion that to get an agreement all future moves must come from UK. It's an unusual approach to conducting a negotiation The negotiator, who was recently given a seat in the House of Lords by Boris Johnson, said he was 'surprised by the suggestion that to get an agreement all future moves must come from UK', dubbing it an 'unusual approach to conducting a  negotiation'. Speaking alongside European Council president Charles Michel, Mr Barnier said that sticking points remain in three perennial areas: the level playing field on regulations, governance of any deal, and fisheries. Of these, the two sides appear to be furthest apart on fisheries, where neither side wants to give ground in a politically charged atmosphere. Some movement appears to have been made on the question of the level playing field, which has largely boiled down to an argument about whether the UK will have freedom to give more state aid to companies after it leaves the single market.  The issue of governance has become particularly important following a UK decision to override parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement with its Internal Market Bill, an episode has led some EU member states to call for stronger enforcement measures for any future deal, diplomats say.

"Shoppers will be able to get cashback even when not buying anything, amid fears of 'cash deserts'",-0.625,Negative,"Customers will be able to get cashback at shops without having to make a purchase, according to Treasury proposals to protect the UK public's access to cash. Cashback was the second most commonly used method by British consumers for withdrawing cash in 2019, after ATMs. There were 123 million cash back transactions last year, amounting to a total value of £3.8bn. The benefits of shops being able to offer cashback, in addition to providing customers with a means to access cash if an ATM is unavailable, include the facilitation of local cash recycling.  According to the Treasury, this reduces costs in the cash system as it lowers the need to transport and redistribute notes and coins via cash centres. But EU regulations made it difficult for shops to offer cashback without a purchase, as under the EU's Second Payment Directive, only authorised businesses such as banks are allowed to provide payment services in the UK. The Treasury said that after the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December, the government is considering a change in the rules to allow more businesses to offer cashback without purchase. It comes as the coronavirus pandemic has pushed consumers towards card and digital payments instead of cash, due to people feeling uncomfortable handling cash that has passed through many hands. Banks also continue to announce branch closures to cut jobs in order to steer themselves through the pandemic, further narrowing options for people who prefer to use cash. Charities have warned that the accelerated move away from cash poses a problem for vulnerable people and fears of 'cash deserts' are rising. But the Treasury, alongside the Bank of England, Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCS)  is keen to find out how cashback can play a greater role in the future and ensure no one gets left as people gravitate towards digital payments. An independent initiative to help communities retain free access to cash, the Community Access to Cash Pilots, was launched in February to experiment with scalable solutions to inform national policy. Natalie Ceeney, chair of the initiative, said: 'I'm very pleased to see the government has made progress on its commitment to protect access to cash. It is essential that we work towards a solution that commits banks, regulators, government and wider stakeholders to keeping cash viable for the millions in detail. 'This is increasingly urgent. Last year we warned that the UK was sleepwalking into a cashless society. Covid-19 has placed even greater strains on the whole system. The devil is in the detail and I look forward to seeing the government's proposal in full.' LINK, the UK's largest ATM network, announced alongside PayPoint in September that it would be trialling cashback without purchase in several locations as part of the pilot initiative. CEO John Howells said in response to the Treasury's call for evidence: 'Access to cash, including from ATMs, is under great strain because people are choosing new ways to pay and as a result of Covid-19. 'But the UK is not ready to go cashless yet and LINK welcomes the government's intention to legislate to support cash access. LINK strongly believes that all communities should have free and convenient access to cash and we look forward to working with community representatives, regulators and industry to maintain this position for years to come.' Consumer advice company Which?, which has long campaigned for the government to protect cash as a payment option, said the Treasury's consultation was a positive step, but warned that businesses refusing to accept cash in light of the pandemic was still a problem. Earlier this year, Which? found that in a study of over 2,000 people, one in 10 were refused by shops when trying to purchase essential items with cash during the pandemic. Gareth Shaw, Head of Money at Which?, said in a statement: 'We are strongly supportive of the FCA taking responsibility for protecting cash, as a current oversight of the cash system is fragmented with no one body accountable. 'While legislation protecting access is key, it risks being undermined if people cannot spend cash on the things they need. In its new role, the FCA should also look at the problem of cash acceptance.' ",0.375,Positive
"Medical supplies needed to fight second wave to be hit by no-deal Brexit, think tank warns",0,Neutral,"Medical supplies crucial to fight a second wave of coronavirus face being disrupted by a no-deal Brexit, a leading health think tank has warned.   They could be interrupted without an agreement on a future trading relationship with the EU, the Nuffield Trust said.   The warning came as the author of a new report said 'negotiators on both sides have not been putting health first' in talks, despite the ongoing global pandemic.   The trust found that imports of medical equipment from the EU hit their highest ever level in March this year.   Leaving the EU's single market without a deal would mean maximum disruption at customs, it adds in the report.   A breakdown in UK-EU relations, in the event of an acrimonious no-deal, could also harm information sharing.   Post-Brexit immigration plans could also mean far fewer people from the EU coming to the UK to take up roles in social care, posing another 'serious problem'.   Nuffield Trust policy analyst Mark Dayan, who wrote the report, said: 'A resurgent second wave of the pandemic is at the forefront of people's minds but the NHS's ability to cope with this extreme demand will be impacted by the decisions taken now in negotiating chambers in London and Brussels.
 'The effects of leaving the single market, even with a deal, will be felt immediately. Given the demand pressure seen during the first wave on protective equipment and medicines there is a real risk to supply should EU controls on medical exports cover the UK.
 'It is not yet clear whether any agreement about the UK's future relationship with the EU after the end of the transition period has the safeguards needed for health and social care services to access the supplies, workforce and data sharing they need to combat the pandemic. Addressing these concerns will often fall on goodwill and cooperation between the two sides.
 'Unfortunately, despite all that has happened this year, negotiators on both sides have not been putting health first. As negotiations enter the crucial final stage we need to see greater prioritisation of health care issues to avoid damaging the NHS and care services and undermining the response to Covid-19.'

No-deal Brexit hangs in the balance at EU summit as Boris Johnson threatens walk out,0,Neutral,"A no-deal Brexit hangs in the balance as Boris Johnson says the outcome of Thursday's EU summit will dictate whether Britain will walk out of talks. EU leaders will meet for their first Brexit summit since the start of the pandemic - a date which the prime minister has long said was his final cut-off. But despite no agreement being in sight, the prime minister is considering whether to prolong the exercise, potentially until the first week of November, to give the teams more time.  Mr Johnson is expected to be told by his chief negotiator David Frost that a deal is still possible, despite a lack of concrete progress on key issues so far - with fishing right a major sticking point.  The prime minister spoke to the presidents of the European Commission and European Council president on Wednesday night, where he ""expressed his disappointment"" that intensified discussions had led to little progress.  Council president Charles Michel said he and Ms Von der Leyen had ""pressed again for progress to be made at the negotiation table"", while a leaked draft of tomorrow's conclusions suggests leaders are unlikely to give ground. Downing Street said the prime minister would wait for the summit to conclude before he decided whether to pull out, with a decision expected after leads head home.  This phase of Brexit talks, to strike a trade deal to go with the divorce deal struck last year, has been overshadowed on both sides of the Channel by the Covid-19 pandemic - with a resulting lack of political urgency and attention so far. 'The prime minister noted the desirability of a deal, but expressed his disappointment that more progress had not been made over the past two weeks,"" a Downing Street spokesperson said of the discussion, which was held by video conference. 'The prime minister said that he looked forward to hearing the outcome of the European Council and would reflect before setting out the UK's next steps in the light of his statement of 7 September.' Ms von der Leyen said there was ""still a lot of work ahead"", adding: ""The EU is working on a deal, but not at any price. Conditions must be right, on fisheries, level-playing field and governance."" Failure to have a deal in place by 31 December is expected to ramp up the economic damage caused by Brexit.   On Wednesday transport secretary Grant Shapps admitted EU-UK flights could be grounded if no workaround could be found, while the government has finally begun to prepare for chaos at ports in Kent. UK moves to row back on commitments it made over Northern Ireland, in breach of international law, have not helped matters, with diplomats in Brussels warning that serious legal safeguards to prevent a repeat on any new deal are now required.  While the question of fisheries looks as intractable as ever, chinks of light have appeared on the issue of the so-called 'level playing field' - the extent to which the UK will abide by EU rules that has also dogged previous rounds. Both sides have made minor concession that could unblock the way - with the UK giving some indication of how its domestic regime might work, and the EU edging away from an insistence on the European Court of Justice having a role. But diplomats warn that it could be for nothing if other issues sink the talks. The prime minister said in September that he saw little point talking through autumn, and that if there was a deal to be done it would emerge by this week's summit.  A draft version of the summit conclusions on Brexit circulated by Brussels backchannels ahead of the meeting says that ""progress on the key issues of interest to the union is still not sufficient for an agreement to be reached"".

Brexit: UK urged to conclude trade deal with EU to limit cost,0,Neutral," A leading international economic watchdog urged the British government to conclude a free trade agreement with the European Union in the coming days and weeks to support the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. In its latest survey of the the British economy the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Wednesday that a trade deal that ensures a close relationship will minimize the costs of Brexit. The OECD, which monitors and advises its 37 member countries, said the British economy will likely end this year 10.1% smaller than the start of the year after the impact of the pandemic, which led to a wide-ranging lockdown in the spring. After a summer lull, the resurgence of the virus has led to further restrictions on businesses by the government, both nationally and locally. It warned that the economy won't have recovered all the ground lost in the spring by the end of 2021 as it is factoring growth of 7.6% for that year. That forecast is based on the assumption that the U.K. and the EU will have reached a free trade arrangement.  Alvaro Pereira, on OECD director, said in a news conference that any form of Brexit 'obviously compounds' the economic effects of the pandemic but that a trade deal would 'help minimize the impact.' Though a trade deal would ensure there are no tariffs and quotas on trade in goods between the two sides, there would be technical costs, partly associated with customs checks as well as non-tariff barriers on trade in services. A summit of EU leaders on Thursday had been set as a deadline for the trade by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. But the talks are now widely expected to continue for a few more weeks. Though the U.K. left the bloc on Jan. 31, it is in a transition period that effectively sees it abide by EU rules until the end of this year. ",-0.625,Negative

Boris Johnson had set Thursday as his deadline for securing an agreement. Mr Coveney told reporters in Luxembourg: ""There are a number of weeks left in this negotiation, not a number of days, so when the European Council meets at the end of this week there will be a detailed stocktake on where we are in these negotiations. But certainly I don't see that there will be any major breakthrough this week."" Meanwhile, Ireland's government announced its 2021 budget was based on the assumption of there will be no bilateral trade deal between the UK and EU, further hinting at the lack of progress. For his part, Mr Johnson insisted Britain had 'no fear' of a no-deal exit in a cabinet meeting, while acknowledging that time was running out. His spokesperson called for 'urgency and realism' on the part of the EU. But Germany's Europe minister, Michael Roth, urged the PM not to play down the potential fallout from no deal. He said: ""This would be very bad news for everyone, for the EU and even more so for the United Kingdom. In the midst of the most serious economic downturn in decades, it would inflict [on] our citizens yet another serious economic setback.  At home, UK businesses were accused of taking a 'head-in-the-sand approach' to the end of the Brexit transition period by Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew. Outrage predictably ensued with Tim Rycroft, of the Food and Drink Federation, saying Lord Agnew's claim was neither helpful nor accurate. On Tuesday evening, Keir Starmer shattered the consensus on coronavirus lockdown restrictions by calling for a three-week nationwide 'circuit-break' in England, to include half-term, in order to drive down infections.  'The government has not got a credible plan to slow infections. It has lost control of the virus. And it is no longer following scientific advice,"" Sir Keir told a press conference. MPs overturn measures to uphold food standards after Brexit MPs overturned measures designed to protect domestic food standards in future trade deals, amid fears over chlorinated chicken. The Commons voted last night by 332 votes to 279 to strike out a Lords amendment which would have required both agricultural and food imports to meet the UK's standards after Brexit. MPs were also denied a vote on a key measure designed to help prevent the likes of chlorinated chicken from America entering Britain.
 Amid growing Tory rebellion Redundancies hit highest rate in a decade   Redundancies are at their highest rate in more than a decade, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said - as the rate of unemployment rose to 4.5 per cent (up from 4.1 per cent in the previous quarter).   In total, 673,000 jobs were lost between March and September. 'However, in total there were still nearly 700,000 fewer [jobs] than in March, before the lockdown,' said the ONS' Jonathan Athow.
 Employment in the UK now stands at 1.52 million people  Sage scientists wanted 'circuit breaker' lockdown weeks ago As Boris Johnson announced the details of a three-tier strategy in England, it emerged the government's scientific advisers had called for an urgent 'circuit break' lockdown for England three weeks ago. Members of Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) warned a package of interventions was needed to stop an exponential rise in coronavirus cases, minutes from a 21 September meeting show.  
 The Sage advisors wanted a short 'circuit breaker' of two to three weeks to cut the number of cases - closing all bars and restaurants, gyms and hairdressers, as well as a ban on all contact with members of another household inside a home.
 The scientists also advised universities and limit teaching to online unless face-to-face contact was deemed 'essential'.
 The latest breaking news, comment and features from The Independent. France will accept 'no weakness' on fishing rights, says minister The French continue to dig their fisherman's sandals in over access to British waters after Brexit. ClÃ©ment Beaune, France's Europe minister and a close political ally of Emmanuel Macron, told business leaders: 'We will have no weakness on this issue of fisheries, that is clear.'   Elsewhere, French MEPs told European Parliament colleagues to vote against any trade deal which does not guarantee 'continuous access to British waters'.   A reminder that on Monday Emmanuel Macron's top ally in Brussels, Dacian CioloÈ™, who leads the Renew group in the European parliament, told The Independent it was time for Boris Johnson to 'decide' whether he actually wants a deal - and personally intervene to make it happen.   UK's services industry could 'suffer' badly after Brexit, peers warn The UK's £225bn professional and business services industry risks could 'suffer' badly after Brexit - even if Boris Johnson's government manages to strikes a trade deal with the EU, a House of Lords subcommittee warned.
 The committee warned that 4.5million jobs were at stake in the sector, and many who work in legal services, accountancy, engineering, PR and management consulting were at risk of losing significant amounts of business to the EU at the end of the transition period.
 Committee chair Baroness Donaghy said: 'This sector, and the people who depend on it for their livelihoods, will suffer if its needs are not reflected in the UK's negotiations with the EU. We are concerned that they have been overlooked in the negotiations so far.'
 We're still following the science, Tory minister insists Communities secretary Robert Jenrick said the government had taken 'robust action' - despite being accused of ignoring its own scientists after documents showed that a 'circuit-breaker"" lockdown was recommended by Sage three weeks ago. 'We listened to that advice as we always do and we did take action but these are balanced judgments,' said Jenrick - claiming the government 'certainly can' still say it is still being led by the science. Asked whether some northern areas with high infection rates such as Manchester and Newcastle should be in the higher alert level, Jenrick said the current status had been agreed with the local leadership. 'I hope they don't have to go into Tier 3. There is no plan for them to do so.'
 No 10's rejection of Sage advice 'alarming', says Labour   So how has Labour responded to the news the government's own scientific advisers wanted something close to full lockdown for England three weeks ago?
 'The revelations in this paper are alarming,' said shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth. 'The government now needs to urgently explain why it ignored its own scientists and what it will be doing to get control of the virus.'
 'Quite self-evidently they have rejected significant recommendations from the scientists.'
 Conservatives' Covid curb sceptics out of step with public MPs will debate and vote on Boris Johnson's new three-tier system later today before new measures come into effect on Wednesday (so long as the government gets its expected majority). How significant will the Tory rebellion be? Around two dozen Tory MPs had negative things to say about the tougher, Tier 3 regulations in the Commons on Monday. But the party's lockdown scepticism appears out of step with the British public. The latest YouGov poll shows 40 per cent of people reckon the new measures don't go far enough, 19 per cent think they get the balance right, while only 15 per cent say they go too far. Almost two-thirds of voters agree the government lacks a clear plan for the crisis. UK faces £40bn a year tax rises, IFS warns Chancellor Rishi Sunak will have to hike taxes by at least £40bn a year by 2025, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).
 Significant annual rises will be necessary to tackle mushrooming public debt, the respected think tank has said. The IFS also predicted that government borrowing this year will reach a level 'never before seen in the UK outside of last century's world wars'.
 Chlorinated chickens will stay 'prohibited', minister claims Environment secretary George Eustice has defended the government's refusal to protect food standards in law - and claimed a 'prohibition' on chlorinated chicken would not change. On Monday, MPs voted to overturn measures aimed at protecting current UK food standards in future trade deals after Brexit. But Eustice said any new legal protection 'wasn't necessary' and the government had given assurances to the National Farmers' Union (NFU) that it would 'uphold our standards'. 'We will be maintaining food standards - it's a manifesto commitment,' he told BBC Scotland. 'We already have a prohibition of the sale of things like chlorine-washed chicken or hormones in beef and that's not going to change.'
 Asked if the UK would walk away from trade talks if the US insisted on lower standards of food imports, Eustice said: 'I don't think they will jeopardise a trade agreement.'

Brexit: Boris Johnson to speak with European Commission chief ahead of crunch summit,0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson is to hold talks with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday, on the eve of his self-imposed deadline for a breakthrough in Brexit trade talks. But it is not thought the pair's second phone contact in the space of a month heralds a surprise breakthrough in negotiations which have been mired for months in unproductive discussions over fisheries, state aid and Brussels' demand for a level playing field on standards as the price of access to the single market. One UK source said the planned discussion was expected to be 'routine'. The prime minister this morning told cabinet that negotiations are 'at a crucial stage' but he still believes a deal can be done in time for the UK's transition to post-Brexit trading arrangements on 31 December. Chief negotiator David Frost is in Brussels for talks with Michel Barnier ahead of a crucial summit of EU leaders on Thursday.  But Lord Frost has recently indicated that the UK may not walk away from the talks if it does not get a deal at the 15 October summit, as Mr Johnson previously threatened. The negotiator told MPs last week that he would instead report back to the PM on the best way forward.

'It is the third unilateral deadline that Johnson has imposed without agreement,' Barnier was said to have remarked. 'We still have time.' Sources said that Mr Barnier had described the negotiations as being in 'a difficult phase', adding that while the tone had become more constructive,  'movement on three key issues was still necessary'. He reportedly told ministers that the UK was seeking to keep the issue of access to British fishing waters 'on the table to the last moment to ensure it can command the highest price for it', but was at the same time asking to remain part of the EU's energy single market, which was worth 'five times' as much as fish economically. Mr Johnson is coming under increasing pressure from business to avoid a no-deal Brexit, which would mean the UK switching to World Trade Organisation rules from 1 January, including tariffs on a wide range of goods which would force up prices in the shops. CBI deputy director-general Josh Hardie said: 'More than three-quarters of businesses want a deal that will support people's jobs and livelihoods amid these incredibly uncertain times. The best way to help preparations is to agree a deal in the coming weeks.' The Republic of Ireland has framed its 2021 budget on the assumption of a no-deal Brexit reducing growth by 3 per cent, and foreign minister Simon Coveney today warned that 'time is running out' for a deal, which must be reached by the end of October to allow time for ratification in European and national parliaments. Germany's Europe minister Michael Roth said that Britain needs to take 'decisive steps' to address remaining issues. He told reporters in Luxembourg: 'I would like to emphasise again that the negotiations are now at a very, very critical stage and we are under very serious time pressure. 'We will see in the next few days whether a positive outcome can be achieved, or whether we have to intensify our preparations for a scenario without an agreement. 'And let me be very clear '“ and this is also a message to our British friends '“ no one should play down the risks of a no deal. This would be very bad news for everyone, for the EU and even more so for the United Kingdom. 'In the midst of the most serious economic downturn in decades, it would inflict our citizens yet another serious economic setback. 'The European Union continues to negotiate constructively and with full intensity to prevent this scenario. We have consistently worked in this direction on the basis of the political declaration that the UK and the EU agreed last year. 'It is now up to the UK to make the decisive steps in key areas '“ in particular in the level playing field, governance and fisheries.' European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic played down the prospect of a breakthrough on Thursday, saying the summit would be 'an important moment to take stock' of the trade negotiations. 'We continue to work for a deal, it's very difficult but it's still possible and our door will remain open until the last useful day,' he said. The prime minister's official spokesman said 'time is in short supply' to reach a post-Brexit trade deal. The spokesman said there was a need for 'more urgency and realism' so that progress can be made on the 'significant gaps' that remain in areas such as fisheries and the level playing field. Asked about Mr Barnier's suggestion that talks would continue in the coming weeks, the spokesman restated the UK's desire for progress by the European Council summit on Thursday. 'There is a need for us to provide clarity in the middle of this month,' the spokesman said. The spokesman said the PM had told cabinet colleagues on Tuesday morning that 'there is still a deal to be done'. But he indicated that Mr Johnson remains ready to take Britain to a no-deal Brexit, which the PM refers to as an 'Australian-style outcome', as Australia has no trade deal with the EU. 'The PM reiterated that, while we want a deal on the right terms, if we can't get there we are ready and willing to move forward with an Australian-style outcome, which holds no fear,' said the spokesman.

Brexit: Business fury over minister's 'heads in the sand' accusation,-0.25,Negative,"A government minister has sparked a backlash from businesses after accusing them of a 'head-in-the-sand' failure to prepare for Brexit, and warned their companies may be at stake as a result.  With just 80 days to go until the UK completes its transition to post-Brexit arrangements and no trade deal agreed with Brussels, Lord Agnew told a Commons committee that thousands of exporters have still not registered for the crucial EORI trading number needed to keep selling to the EU.  The Treasury and Cabinet Office minister said that there 'seems to be a lack of urgency on the part of too many traders'.   But the chief operating officer of the Food and Drink Federation, Tim Rycroft, retorted: 'I don't think it's accurate or helpful for ministers to assert that traders have not engaged in Brexit planning.  'If any traders have their head in the sand it's because, after many frustrating months awaiting critical answers, they probably think it's more likely they'll find those answers in the sand than they will from the Government.' The policy director of freight hauliers' trade body Logistics UK, Elizabeth de Jong, said: 'Rather than ignoring the UK's upcoming departure from the EU, Logistics UK has been proactively urging its members to make sure that they and their customers prepare as much as possible for the new trading conditions we will face."" And CBI deputy director-general Josh Hardie said: 'Businesses are doing all they can to prepare for Brexit. But firms face a hat-trick of unprecedented challenges: rebuilding from the first wave of Covid-19, dealing with the resurgence of the virus and uncertainty over the UK's trading relationship with the EU.  'More than three-quarters of businesses want a deal that will support people's jobs and livelihoods amid these incredibly uncertain times. The best way to help preparations is to agree a deal in the coming weeks.""

And he told the cross-party committee: 'The bit that worries me the most is the trader readiness. 'There's been a head-in-the-sand approach by traders which has been compounded by what I would call the quadruple-whammy of two false alarms '“ two extensions at the very last minute '“ then followed by Covid and now followed by the recession. 'The traders are not as ready as they should be.' Lord Agnew said he hoped his comments would 'send another shot over traders' bows to warn them that it is their businesses that are at stake from 1 January and they really must engage in a more energetic way.' The committee heard that 250,000 UK exporters do not sell outside the EU and have no experience of the new red tape which will be required following Brexit. Of these, at least 40,000 have not yet applied for an EORI number, which is a basic requirement for them to keep exporting. Lord Agnew said it was hoped that the smartphone app will be ready for rollout in November, but described it as the 'icing on the cake' of the new border system. But asked whether failure to deploy it in time would cause 'a major problem with traders descending on Dover', he replied: 'You have, you're absolutely right.' The government minister indicated that hopes of clearing gridlock at the big Channel ports would depend in part on companies learning from the painful experience of lengthy delays and fines for not having the right paperwork. He said: 'To be brutal about it, how many times is a lorry driver going to drive into Kent, take a £300 fine and park up at Manston for 36 hours while he gets his paperwork sorted?'¨'I hope to goodness that they won't let them do that more than once. That's the consequence of not being ready - you turn up, you get a fine, you get parked in a holding bay while they sort your paperwork out, there will be congestion and they might send you home because they can't sort your paperwork out. Lord Agnew said that the 4,000-truck holding centre at Manston was 'not in a particularly good geographic position' for taking traffic from Dover and was only '85 per cent ready to go'. The MPs were told that other inland sites were being setting up, including at Ebbsfleet and Ashford in Kent. ",0,Neutral
"Brexit: 'Catastrophic' risk to lawyers, architects and other professionals being ignored, peers warn",-1,Negative,"Architects, engineers, lawyers and other professionals have been forgotten in the Brexit talks and could suffer a 'catastrophic' hit, peers warn today. Firms in the vital services sector face potentially huge new obstacles to trading in the EU - but cannot prepare 'because they are not sure what to prepare for', the report concludes. Yet the sector is worth a colossal £225bn to the UK economy, providing 4.6 million jobs, while the UK and EU fight over fishing rights worth a miniscule amount in comparison. Ministers must secure mutual recognition of qualifications, the right to cross-border travel and prevent national governments imposing their own restrictions, the Lords EU services sub-committee said. Different restrictions enforced by separate EU capitals would be 'catastrophic for the UK's professional and business services', its inquiry was told, it notes. Baroness Donaghy, the committee's chair, said: 'We are concerned that they have been overlooked in the negotiations so far.' The committee's report comes with just 79 days until the end of the post-Brexit transition period, during which existing rules and regulations have been maintained. It points out that Boris Johnson's deal called for an 'ambitious, comprehensive' deal for services, including 'most favoured nation' status for both sides. But, the report said, free trade in services requires people to be able to move across borders, for firms to be able to set up offices and mutual recognition of standards and qualifications.

He has called the use of this quote ""fundamentally dishonest"" as it was taken from a 2011 speech discussing the option of referendum before David Cameron entered negotiations with the EU. Such a vote was never held. Twitter/Led By Donkeys Furthermore, it is member states - not Brussels - that make many of those rules, which raises the threat of 'national reservations' to protect sectors from foreign competition. Warning a free trade deal was, by itself, 'no silver bullet', Baroness Donaghy said: 'These barriers to trade must be prevented. 'It is essential that issues such as EU member state national reservations to the agreement, the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and business mobility are dealt with properly in a future UK-EU agreement. 'Despite being so close to the end of the transition period, many businesses, especially SMEs [small businesses], are not well prepared, not least because they are not sure what to prepare for.' The sector includes 'advertising, legal services, market research, accountancy, audit, architecture, engineering, PR and management consulting'. The hoped-for trade deal must 'explicitly commit not to tie market access' to having an established local office or residency rights, the report said. While freedom of movement will end, arrangements for business travel should be 'as ambitious and comprehensive as possible'. The alarm is also raised over the UK's failure to secure a 'data adequacy' agreement with the EU - something not expected to be agreed until long after the end of the transition, on 31 December. In June, the security minister, James Brokenshire, admitted the UK was taking 'sensible steps to prepare for a situation where that decision may not be in place'. ",0,Neutral
Brexit: Trade talks in a rut as yet another deadline looms - 'Time is in short supply',0.125,Positive," Almost by tradition, another Brexit deadline is looming. Just as much by tradition, talks are expected to continue afterward.  British negotiators traveled to European Union headquarters on Monday to start what has long been billed as another do-or-die session between both sides. The divorce was settled at the end of January when the U.K. left the spurned bloc. Now, the end of a transition period is drawing close and both sides have to decide what kind of trade deal, if any, they want.  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has long billed the two-day EU summit that starts Thursday as an ultimate deadline. The 27-nation EU is willing to go on until early November to craft a deal, however basic, that could still save hundreds of thousands of jobs and prevent an even worse economic crisis than the coronavirus pandemic has already wrought. On Monday, Johnson's spokesman said the U.K. still viewed this week's talks as crucial.  'Time is in short supply,' said James Slack. 'We will work as hard as we can to see if we can get an agreement by Oct. 15. The EU themselves indicated to the U.K. negotiating team in July that mid-October was the last possible date for a deal.' The urgency was highlighted by weekend phone calls between Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the Council president, were calling other EU leaders to make sure the bloc remained united.  In Paris, pressure was incraesed by yet another warning for businesses to prepare for a drastic rupture, possibly without a deal.  After months of talks, Britain and the EU appear to remain deadlocked on the key issues of fishing and rules to ensure fair economic competition. If there is any hope for a deal, neither side is letting on. 'Intensive discussions continue in Brussels this week,"" said EU Commission spokesman Daniel Ferrie, refusing to elaborate.  Negotiating teams led by Michel Barnier on the EU side and David Frost on the British end have struggled for months to make progress and have three fundamental issues left to deal with. The EU wants to make sure British firms will not go low on regulation and high on subsidies to undercut EU companies if any deal on zero tariffs and zero quotas is agreed upon. The member states have also become ardent in demanding legal guarantees on governance of any deal since Johnson last month introduced legislation that breaches the Brexit withdrawal agreement he himself signed with the EU only last year '” a move that has demolished trust between the two sides. 'Our position is simple clear and steadfast: If there is no level playing field, there is no access to our market,' said France's EU minister, Clement Beaune. The last crucial issue is about fishing rights, which affects only a fraction of GDP on both sides but has gained symbolic heft. Britain demands to fully rule its waves, while France and others have big fishing industries to accommodate. If Britain has made it already legally binding that it will not extend a transition period beyond Jan. 1, that deadline seems set in stone. The EU has said that any agreement will take about two months for legal ratification, translation into the many EU languages and for approval from the EU parliament, making for an effective cutoff date around Nov. 1.  During the negotiations on the withdrawal deal since the 2016 U.K. referendum to leave, both sides often threatened with deadlines, but still found a belated agreement last year on the U.K. departure.  __ Jill Lawless from London and Angela Charlton from Paris contributed.  ___ Follow all AP stories on the Brexit trade talks at https://apnews.com/Brexit.

"Brexit news - live: 'No major breakthrough' on trade deal this week, Irish foreign minister predicts",1.125,Positive,"Britain and the EU are unlikely to agree a Brexit deal by this week's European Council meeting the Irish foriegn minister, Simon Coveney, has said. Boris Johnson had set Thursday as his deadline for securing an agreement. Mr Coveney told reporters in Luxembourg: ""There are a number of weeks left in this negotiation, not a number of days, so when the European Council meets at the end of this week there will be a detailed stocktake on where we are in these negotiations. But certainly I don't see that there will be any major breakthrough this week."" Meanwhile, Ireland's government announced its 2021 budget was based on the assumption of there will be no bilateral trade deal between the UK and EU, further hinting at the lack of progress. For his part, Mr Johnson insisted Britain had 'no fear' of a no-deal exit in a cabinet meeting, while acknowledging that time was running out. His spokesperson called for 'urgency and realism' on the part of the EU. But Germany's Europe minister, Michael Roth, urged the PM not to play down the potential fallout from no deal. He said: ""This would be very bad news for everyone, for the EU and even more so for the United Kingdom. In the midst of the most serious economic downturn in decades, it would inflict [on] our citizens yet another serious economic setback.  At home, UK businesses were accused of taking a 'head-in-the-sand approach' to the end of the Brexit transition period by Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew. Outrage predictably ensued with Tim Rycroft, of the Food and Drink Federation, saying Lord Agnew's claim was neither helpful nor accurate. On Tuesday evening, Keir Starmer shattered the consensus on coronavirus lockdown restrictions by calling for a three-week nationwide 'circuit-break' in England, to include half-term, in order to drive down infections.  'The government has not got a credible plan to slow infections. It has lost control of the virus. And it is no longer following scientific advice,"" Sir Keir told a press conference. MPs overturn measures to uphold food standards after Brexit MPs overturned measures designed to protect domestic food standards in future trade deals, amid fears over chlorinated chicken. The Commons voted last night by 332 votes to 279 to strike out a Lords amendment which would have required both agricultural and food imports to meet the UK's standards after Brexit. MPs were also denied a vote on a key measure designed to help prevent the likes of chlorinated chicken from America entering Britain.
 Amid growing Tory rebellion Redundancies hit highest rate in a decade   Redundancies are at their highest rate in more than a decade, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said - as the rate of unemployment rose to 4.5 per cent (up from 4.1 per cent in the previous quarter).   In total, 673,000 jobs were lost between March and September. 'However, in total there were still nearly 700,000 fewer [jobs] than in March, before the lockdown,' said the ONS' Jonathan Athow.
 Employment in the UK now stands at 1.52 million people  Sage scientists wanted 'circuit breaker' lockdown weeks ago As Boris Johnson announced the details of a three-tier strategy in England, it emerged the government's scientific advisers had called for an urgent 'circuit break' lockdown for England three weeks ago. Members of Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) warned a package of interventions was needed to stop an exponential rise in coronavirus cases, minutes from a 21 September meeting show.  
 The Sage advisors wanted a short 'circuit breaker' of two to three weeks to cut the number of cases - closing all bars and restaurants, gyms and hairdressers, as well as a ban on all contact with members of another household inside a home.
 The scientists also advised universities and limit teaching to online unless face-to-face contact was deemed 'essential'.
 The latest breaking news, comment and features from The Independent. France will accept 'no weakness' on fishing rights, says minister The French continue to dig their fisherman's sandals in over access to British waters after Brexit. ClÃ©ment Beaune, France's Europe minister and a close political ally of Emmanuel Macron, told business leaders: 'We will have no weakness on this issue of fisheries, that is clear.'   Elsewhere, French MEPs told European Parliament colleagues to vote against any trade deal which does not guarantee 'continuous access to British waters'.   A reminder that on Monday Emmanuel Macron's top ally in Brussels, Dacian CioloÈ™, who leads the Renew group in the European parliament, told The Independent it was time for Boris Johnson to 'decide' whether he actually wants a deal - and personally intervene to make it happen.   UK's services industry could 'suffer' badly after Brexit, peers warn The UK's £225bn professional and business services industry risks could 'suffer' badly after Brexit - even if Boris Johnson's government manages to strikes a trade deal with the EU, a House of Lords subcommittee warned.
 The committee warned that 4.5million jobs were at stake in the sector, and many who work in legal services, accountancy, engineering, PR and management consulting were at risk of losing significant amounts of business to the EU at the end of the transition period.
 Committee chair Baroness Donaghy said: 'This sector, and the people who depend on it for their livelihoods, will suffer if its needs are not reflected in the UK's negotiations with the EU. We are concerned that they have been overlooked in the negotiations so far.'
 We're still following the science, Tory minister insists Communities secretary Robert Jenrick said the government had taken 'robust action' - despite being accused of ignoring its own scientists after documents showed that a 'circuit-breaker"" lockdown was recommended by Sage three weeks ago. 'We listened to that advice as we always do and we did take action but these are balanced judgments,' said Jenrick - claiming the government 'certainly can' still say it is still being led by the science. Asked whether some northern areas with high infection rates such as Manchester and Newcastle should be in the higher alert level, Jenrick said the current status had been agreed with the local leadership. 'I hope they don't have to go into Tier 3. There is no plan for them to do so.'
 No 10's rejection of Sage advice 'alarming', says Labour   So how has Labour responded to the news the government's own scientific advisers wanted something close to full lockdown for England three weeks ago?
 'The revelations in this paper are alarming,' said shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth. 'The government now needs to urgently explain why it ignored its own scientists and what it will be doing to get control of the virus.'
 'Quite self-evidently they have rejected significant recommendations from the scientists.'
 Conservatives' Covid curb sceptics out of step with public MPs will debate and vote on Boris Johnson's new three-tier system later today before new measures come into effect on Wednesday (so long as the government gets its expected majority). How significant will the Tory rebellion be? Around two dozen Tory MPs had negative things to say about the tougher, Tier 3 regulations in the Commons on Monday. But the party's lockdown scepticism appears out of step with the British public. The latest YouGov poll shows 40 per cent of people reckon the new measures don't go far enough, 19 per cent think they get the balance right, while only 15 per cent say they go too far. Almost two-thirds of voters agree the government lacks a clear plan for the crisis. UK faces £40bn a year tax rises, IFS warns Chancellor Rishi Sunak will have to hike taxes by at least £40bn a year by 2025, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).
 Significant annual rises will be necessary to tackle mushrooming public debt, the respected think tank has said. The IFS also predicted that government borrowing this year will reach a level 'never before seen in the UK outside of last century's world wars'.
 Chlorinated chickens will stay 'prohibited', minister claims Environment secretary George Eustice has defended the government's refusal to protect food standards in law - and claimed a 'prohibition' on chlorinated chicken would not change. On Monday, MPs voted to overturn measures aimed at protecting current UK food standards in future trade deals after Brexit. But Eustice said any new legal protection 'wasn't necessary' and the government had given assurances to the National Farmers' Union (NFU) that it would 'uphold our standards'. 'We will be maintaining food standards - it's a manifesto commitment,' he told BBC Scotland. 'We already have a prohibition of the sale of things like chlorine-washed chicken or hormones in beef and that's not going to change.'
 Asked if the UK would walk away from trade talks if the US insisted on lower standards of food imports, Eustice said: 'I don't think they will jeopardise a trade agreement.'

English villages wake up to find they're Brexit's new border: 'It's taking back control',0.375,Positive," Four years after Britain voted to leave the European Union Brexit can still seem abstract. But in the county known as the Garden of England, it is literally taking concrete form. Just beyond the ancient oaks and yews that surround medieval St. Mary's Church in the village of Sevington, bulldozers, dump trucks and cement mixers swarm noisily over a field. They are chewing up land to create part of Britain's new border with the European Union '” a customs clearance depot with room for up to 2,000 trucks. No one asked local people for permission, and even in this Brexit-backing area, the disruption is straining support for the U.K.'s rupture with the EU. 'The first anyone knew about it was when a sign went up saying the footpaths had been closed,' said Sharon Swandale, whose home in the village of Mersham used to be a 20-minute walk from Sevington. Closure of the path for construction work means it's now an almost 4-mile (6.4-kilometer) drive. This county, Kent, voted by 60%-40% to leave the EU in Britain's 2016 referendum, but Swandale said visions of truck stops and customs depots were not uppermost in their minds. 'That was never part of the actual selling and the marketing for Brexit,' she said. The two prosperous villages of Sevington and Mersham are 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the Channel Tunnel to France and 20 miles (32 kilometers) from Britain's biggest ferry port at Dover. Between them, the two routes carry 4 million trucks a year, filled with food and all manner of other essential items. Those goods moved back and forth freely while Britain was part of the EU's single market and customs union. The U.K. left the bloc's political structures in January, and will make an economic break when a transition period ends Dec. 31. That means Britain must erect a customs border with the 27-nation EU, its biggest trading partner. Opponents of Brexit say it is a waste of money and effort that will hurt businesses on both sides. For supporters, it's all part of taking back control of the country's borders and trade. But everyone agrees it means new red tape, with the need for customs declarations and inspections. If the U.K. and the EU fail to strike a free trade deal before the end of the year, tariffs will be slapped on many goods, bringing more disruption, bureaucracy and expense. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government has been reluctant to disclose details of its border plans. But last month it admitted its 'reasonable worst-case scenario' involved '7,000 port-bound trucks in Kent and associated maximum delays of up to two days.' The government's plans for limiting the disruption include converting parts of a highway into a temporary parking lot for trucks, and imposing a 'Kent access pass' '” essentially a passport that truckers heading for the EU must have to enter Kent from other parts of Britain. The Sevington site is intended for customs checks, and could also be a 'temporary traffic management facility' '” a parking lot '” for trucks if there are border delays, the government says. The 27-acre field is one of 10 sites around the country earmarked for potential border infrastructure, under powers the government has given itself to buy and build without consulting local authorities or residents first. 'Up to now no local resident has seen the plans,' said Rick Martin, chairman of Sevington parish council, adding that locals are worried about gridlock and the effect the site will have on property prices.  'People are quite perplexed at the moment about what it's going to look like when there's 1,000 lorries parked across the road,' he said. Sevington and Mersham are ancient settlements, mentioned in the 1086 census known as the Domesday Book, but the residents can't be said to reject modern life. They already live with the hum of traffic on the M20 highway that cuts through the area, and the sound of trains whooshing at 185 mph (300 kph) toward the Channel Tunnel. That makes them even more determined to preserve the remaining rural character of their communities. With the support of local politicians, villagers are trying to limit the damage by saving an adjoining field, also bought by the government but not yet slated for development. It's the last green space between them and the sprawling town of Ashford nearby. 'It would be the perfect place to save as a green buffer between all the development here and the village,' said Swandale, a member of the Village Alliance, a local campaigning group. Construction has already chased off the skylarks that used to inhabit the future customs site. Swandale says preserving the other field could save great crested newts and dormice and the paths used by walkers, cyclists and horse riders. 'It's taking back control,' she said, echoing the Brexiteer slogan. 'It's having this for the local people, it's using it. It's planting trees to reduce carbon, it's increasing its biodiversity. '¦ It would go a long way to mitigate this development.' Britons still don't know whether New Year's Day 2021 will bring the government's worst-case scenario or a smoother exit. Talks on a U.K.-EU trade deal are deadlocked over fishing rights and fair-competition rules. At a summit this week, EU leaders will assess whether a breakthrough is possible. There are only weeks left to seal a deal if it is to be ratified by year's end. Paul Bartlett, a Conservative member of Kent County Council who lives right beside the huge construction site, acknowledges the customs facility on his doorstep came as a surprise. But as a staunch supporter of Brexit, he is determined to see the positive side of the new customs site. 'We need jobs,"" he said, after the coronavirus pandemic plunged the U.K. into recession. ""I hope we'll have 300 jobs and there's a good system of apprenticeships that young people can sign up to and develop a career for themselves. 'It's a beautiful part of the country to live in, and sometimes you've got to take the rough with the smooth.' ",0,Neutral

Meanwhile, trade secretary Liz Truss rebuffed fresh calls to guarantee food standards in law after Brexit and avoid chlorinated chicken from the US. Elsewhere, two Tory select committee chairs, Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt, have launched an inquiry into the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. It was another difficult day for the government regarding Covid-19 as northern leaders raged at Boris Johnson's failure to keep them in the loop about impending lockdown restrictions. Finally, Thursday saw the appointment of Allegra Stratton as Downing Street's White House-style spokesperson. The former ITV journalist, who had been working as Rishi Sunak's communications chief, will front televised briefings for the government. Trump thanks Johnson for support getting over 'China virus' Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to express his gratitude for Boris Johnson's 'friendship and support', after the pair spoke on the phone on Wednesday. After talking about his recovery from coronavirus - which he described using the term 'China Virus' - the president went on to say confidently that he would work with the British prime minister 'for many years to come'. This, of course, depends on what happens in the US election on 3 November. Brexit bill has UK on course to 'dictatorship', says ex-Supreme Court chief A ex-president of the Supreme Court has warned that the government's Brexit legislation risks taking the UK down a 'very slippery slope' towards 'dictatorship'. Lord Neuberger, who presided over the UK's highest court for five years until 2017, described the Internal Markets Bill as 'quite extraordinary and worrying', saying that some of its clauses ""freely breach its obligations under international treaties"" and also ""make regulations which it would appear the courts are not entitled to review"". The judge made the comments in a virtual meeting with lawyers on Wednesday evening. Here's more on the story from my colleague Jon Stone: Lord Neuberger is second former supreme court judge to speak out this week Starmer tells PM to back farmers with food standard laws  Labour leader Keir Starmer has urged Boris Johnson to address growing concerns that post-Brexit trade deals could undercut British farmers, and allow lower quality food into the country. This comes amid worries around a potential trade deal with the US, which critics say could lead to products such as chlorinated chicken appearing on British supermarket shelves. A million people have now signed a petition calling on the government to protect high food standards.  ""No one wants lower quality food on our plates, but unless the prime minister shows some leadership and backs British farmers there is a real risk this could happen,' Starmer said. Johnson 'set to close pubs in north of England' It looks like Boris Johnson will follow the path laid out by Nicola Sturgeon. No 10 has decided to shut pubs and restaurants across large parts of the north of England on Monday, according to The Times. The PM is said to have signed off on the big 'circuit breaker' move last night alongside financial support for affected businesses (the newspaper says chancellor Rishi Sunak has 'won the right' to be consulted whenever pubs are shut down).   The government is also expected to introduce its simplified, three-tier system of restrictions - with Merseyside and other parts of the north placed in the highest tier. What does it mean for the Tory rebels, who don't like existing restrictions? What does it mean for Labour?   Keir Starmer suggested his party would vote against the 10pm curfew next week - demanding the government publishes the scientific advice behind the early closing. Will he remain so adamant if Johnson brings in 'emergency' measures on Monday?
 Three-tier system could be introduced next week to simplify lockdowns Confidence slumps in Boris Johnson's government Confidence in the handling of the coronavirus pandemic by Boris Johnson's government has slumped since the beginning of lockdown, according to researchers at UCL.
 Some 56 per cent recently reported having no confidence, on balance, in No 10's response to the crisis - up from 25 per cent at the start of lockdown.
 Only 6 per cent of people reported having 'no confidence at all' in the government's handling in March - but this has increased to 27 per cent.
 Minister refuses to confirm pub closures for north Robert Jenrick has declined to confirm whether pubs and restaurants in parts of northern England will be forced to close again next week.
 Speaking to the BBC's Breakfast, the communities secretary said it 'was not sensible' for him to speculate about the possible measures, despite being repeatedly asked.   Although he did tell the programme: 'It is correct to say the number of cases in the north west and the north east and a number of cities, particularly in the Midlands like Nottingham, are rising fast and that is a serious situation.  
 'We are currently considering what steps we should take, obviously taking the advice of our scientific and medical advisers, and a decision will be made shortly.'
 Tory committee chiefs launch inquiry into government's handling of pandemic A big move this morning from two former Tory cabinet ministers, who have launched a joint parliamentary inquiry into the government's handling of the Covid pandemic. They saying No 10's own probe will come 'too late'.
 Greg Clark, chair of the Commons science and technology committee and Jeremy Hunt, chair of the health committee, said 'important lessons need to be learned' to help inform decisions through the next phase of the crisis.
 Their two committees - alongside MPs who sit on them - will aim to produce a joint report in the Spring of 2021, but insisted there will be 'staging posts' along the way.
 In their sessions the chairs are expected to call on ministers and on professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific, who have often appeared alongside Boris Johnson at No 10, to give evidence to MPs.
 Chairs of Commons science and health committees warn PM's promised independent inquiry will come 'too late' for the months ahead European Council chief meets Irish premier   The president of the European Council Charles Michel is visiting Dublin today to discuss Brexit negotiations with Ireland's premier Micheal Martin.
 Michel shared his frustration with Downing Street after Wednesday's phone call with Boris Johnson - saying it was time for the UK to 'put its cards on the table'.
 Yet No 10's chief negotiator David Frost and Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove sounded upbeat when speaking to MPs on Wednesday. Frost suggested he was in favour of a 'dispute settlement mechanism' for any state aid row - one of the big sticking points in talks.   Intriguingly, No 10's latest press release said 'significant areas of difference remain, particularly on fisheries' - but did not mention state aid as a key point if difference as it usually does. Asked by MPs whether it was fair to say there's a '66 per cent chance' of a trade deal, Gove said that was 'about right'.   Hunt calls for 'more transparency' as he launches Covid inquiry Tory MP Jeremy Hunt - the head of the Commons' select committee - has been explaining why he and his colleague Greg Clarke have taken the bold step of launching an inquiry in the government's coronavirus response. 'More transparency would be beneficial,' Boris Johnson's former leadership rival told Sky News. 'It is clear that we got some things wrong at the start of the pandemic, and I think that's to be expected - we have to be prepared change tact as the data changes.'
 He also told Sky News he hoped most of us could get a vaccine by spring 2021. 'If I was a betting man, I would say I think we probably will find a vaccine before Christmas - and I'm hopeful we can get it to the bulk of the population by Easter.'
 Who is Allegra Stratton, Boris Johnson's new spokesperson? Former journalist Allegra Stratton is to be the face of the government's new daily press conferences. If Boris Johnson's new regime goes to plan, she'll become face familiar across the nation. But just who is she?

Liam Fox fails in bid to lead World Trade Organisation,0.125,Positive,"Liam Fox has said he is ""disappointed"" after he failed in his bid to become the director-general of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The Tory right-winger failed to make the last round of the contest, which will be between South Korea's Yoo Myung-hee and Nigeria's Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. Dr Fox, who famously said the EU-UK trade deal after Brexit would be the 'easiest in history', had been nominated by Boris Johnson for the role. The decision to put the South Korean and Nigerian candidates through to the final round means that the WTO is set to be run by a woman for the first time in its 25-year history. The final decision about who will lead the organisation, replacing Brazil's Roberto Azevedo, will be made next month. The UK has never held the WTO presidency, though Briton Eric Wyndham White was the founding chief of its precursor organisation, the GATT, from 1948 until 1968. Holding the prestigious role would have been a coup for Boris Johnson and his allies, who have put international trade at the centre of their pitch to sell Brexit to the British public. In a statement on Thursday, the former defence secretary Dr Fox said he would be 'returning to Westminster' to represent his constituents. 'I am proud to have been nominated by the prime minister was the UK's nominee for the position of director-general of the World Trade Organisation,"" Dr Fox said in a statement.

Brexit: EU demands Boris Johnson 'puts UK cards on table',-0.25,Negative,"The EU has lashed out at Boris Johnson for failing to engage in the Brexit talks, telling him: 'Time for the UK to put its cards on the table'. Charles Michel, the European Council president revealed his frustration with the prime minister after talks intended to unlocks the stalled negotiations. 'The EU prefers a deal, but not at any cost,' Mr Michel warned - after the UK's chief negotiator admitted no 'extensive text' on state aid rules would be submitted. Downing Street said after the talks that  the two sides would aim to 'bridge gaps' before a milestone European Council summit schedule next week, but said 'significant differences' remain. It is the second time in recent days that Mr Johnson has been accused of failing to offer anything new to bring a deal closer - despite his own 15 October deadline for striking one being just a week away. After his weekend talks with Ursula von der Leyen, the Commission president, EU sources made clear its irritation that he was failing to get down to crucial details. The criticism came as the EU's team arrived in London for fresh talks, due to last until Friday, with more negotiations in Brussels next week before the  European Council meeting. Both sides now appear privately  resigned to talks continuing long beyond that summit on the 15th - long pinpointed as the deadline - if a trade agreement is to be achieved. The EU has attacked the UK for failing to explain how it will regulate state aid, or settle disputes, in order to deliver the 'level playing field' Mr Johnson signed up to a year ago. However, earlier, the UK's chief negotiator admitted talks on the key obstacle to an agreement were 'only just beginning - with the two sides are 'some way from a deal'.

'We are some way from a deal at the moment, if I'm honest,' he told a Lords inquiry - with the date for the UK to crash out of the transition period less than three months' away. Lord Frost also did not deny that vital security data - to target terrorists and organised criminals - will be automatically 'deleted' if it ends in a no-deal Brexit. But he insisted the UK would not shut the door to a deal, even if Mr Johnson's deadline of mid-October is missed, saying: 'Our door would never be closed.' Asked at a later hearing of a House of Commons committee whether there will be a deal by the PM's self-imposed deadline, Frost said only: 'My job is to get as far as we can before the 15th and then I will have to advise the prime minister whether the conditions for a basis of an agreement are in place at that point, and what happens thereafter.' Lord Frost told the Commons Committee on the Future Relationship with the EU that it remains the UK's stated policy that it will prepare to leave on World Trade Organisation terms if no deal is in place by the end of next week, telling MPs: 'It is really important that we try to bring some certainly to stakeholders, given the imminent end of the transition period and all the preparations that need to be done.' Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told the committee he believed there was a 66% chance of a free trade agreement with the EU, while Lord Frost said: 'I think a deal is eminently achievable and could be achieved, but equally it is possible that we won't get there.' Mr Gove pointed to tensions as he attacked the portrayal of the EU as 'upholders of virtue' - with the UK as a 'potential rogue'. He admitted the extra red tape for business - even if a deal is reached, outside the single market and customs union - mean there was little difference from a no deal. Mr Gove took inspiration from the world of pop as he said he was prepared to take responsibility for any traffic gridlock caused in Kent caused by the transition out of the EU, telling the Commons committee: 'If things go wrong, then - to paraphrase Rag'n'Bone Man - put the blame on me.' And he refused to commit to withdrawing the clauses in the Internal Markets Bill that break international law, even if the EU backed down, saying: 'Wait and see.' Lord Frost told MPs that differences over fisheries was 'the most difficult issue remaining', and confirmed that the UK had offered a transition period away from the current quota system to allow continental fleets to adapt to new arrangements. 'Obviously there's going to be an effect on EU fishing communities, and it seems entirely reasonable for us that - providing that the endpoint is one we wish to get to - therre could be some glide path to get there,' he told the Commons committee.
 But he added: 'I don't think we would wish to conclude an agreement that didn't satisfy the reasonable expectations of UK fishermen.' Mr Michel, who represents the interests of member states, spoke with Mr Johnson  by phone on Wednesday.  Downing Street later released a statement saying that the call had allowed both sides to 'take stock of negotiations"" 'The prime minister outlined our clear commitment to trying to reach an agreement, underlining that a deal was better for both sides,"" said a spokesman. ""He also underlined that, nevertheless, the UK was prepared to end the transition period on Australia-style terms if an agreement could not be found.  'Although some progress had been made in recent discussions, they acknowledged that significant areas of difference remain, particularly on fisheries. Chief negotiators should continue to work intensively in the coming days to try to bridge the gaps.  'The prime minister reiterated that any deal must reflect what the British people voted for and that businesses and citizens needed certainty very soon on the terms of our future relationship. 'They agreed to remain in touch on this issue.' ",0,Neutral
Boris Johnson news: Brexit deal 'closer and closer' as PM says life cannot go back to normal,-0.5,Negative,"The UK and the EU are getting 'closer and closer' to a Brexit trade deal, according to diplomats in Brussels. EU officials are said to be gearing up to negotiate until as late as mid-November to avoid a damaging no-deal scenario at the end of the year. It comes as Boris Johnson claimed life 'cannot go back to normal' after the pandemic - but said he expected no more social distancing by October 2021. The PM promised 5 per cent deposits for first-time buyers and extra investment in wind power at his conference speech.  MPs voted to retain the rule of six restricting gatherings to six people - despite a backbench rebellion as senior Tory MPs urged the prime minister to change direction. The regulation was approved by 287 votes to 17, with Labour abstaining. Chemical weapons body confirms nerve agent Novichok in Navalny's blood Blood samples taken from Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny confirmed the presence of a nerve agent from the banned Novichok family, the global chemical weapons watchdog said on Tuesday. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said in a statement that the biomarkers in his blood and urine had ""similar structural characteristics as the toxic chemicals belonging"" to the Novichok group. The findings confirm results released by Germany, where Navalny was treated after falling ill on a flight in Siberia on 20 August. Berlin asked the OPCW to take samples from Nr Navalny and test them after German doctors concluded he had been poisoned with Novichok. The precise substance in Nr Navalny's samples that was detected by the OPCW's designated laboratories was not on the list of banned chemical weapons, but is a new and undeclared variant in the Novichok family, the statement said.

Infected Trump working from White House residence US president Donald Trump is working from makeshift office space in the White House residence rather than the Oval Office, with only a few senior staff gaining face-to-face access while he receives treatment for Covid-19, officials said on Tuesday. They said aides were looking at potential West Wing work spaces while he recover, with the Oval Office, where Trump normally works, off limits now that several staffers have been infected and forced to work from home. Aides said they were looking at where else he might safely work in the West Wing. ""He has space up in the residence and we are working out additional work space for him with appropriate medical precautions and logistics, so that he can fully carry out his duties and maintain the safety of himself and all those around him,"" said one official. Social care groups call for action, not words, from Johnson on funding Social care organisations called for action from Boris Johnson on funding reform for the sector after the prime minister again pledged to set out a plan to deal with the situation. Mr Johnson used his address to the virtual Conservative Party conference to insist he would ""fix the injustice of care home funding"". However, groups and charities involved in social care insisted a detailed strategy was now urgently needed. The Prime Minister told the virtual conference: ""We will fix the injustice of care home funding, bringing the magic of averages to the rescue of millions. ""Covid has shone a spotlight on the difficulties of that sector in all parts of the UK - and to build back better we must respond, care for the carers as they care for us."" Nuffield Trust deputy director of policy Natasha Curry branded the speech a ""missed opportunity"". Simon Bottery, senior fellow at The King's Fund, said the Prime Minister's words were a long way from his original promise to take action. He said: ""The social care system is not fit for purpose and while the Prime Minister's speech puts welcome focus back on the issue, this is still a long way from his earlier promise to fix social care 'once and for all'.' Raab condemns 'serious and egregious' human rights violations by China The UK has sought to increase international pressure on China over human rights abuses, with Dominic Raab refusing to rule out a boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022. At the United Nations, the UK was one of 39 countries to raise concerns about the security crackdown in Hong Kong and the abuse of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab told MPs at Westminster that evidence of abuses in Xinjiang was being reviewed to see whether it amounted to genocide. He told the Foreign Affairs Committee: ""I have made clear that there is evidence of serious and egregious human rights violations, gross human rights violations."" But to be classed as genocide, Mr Raab, a former war crimes lawyer, said it had to be proved that the deliberate intention was the destruction of a minority group. ""Certainly, I think the more that we see of that evidence, and I think the more the international community addresses its mind to it, the more I think we do need to look very carefully at what action we take,"" Mr Raab said. ""I think the concerns of what's happening to the Uighurs - the detention, the mistreatment, the forced sterilisation - is something that we can't just turn away from."" Biden victory could be problem for Johnson government, says Lord Darroch Former British ambassador to the US Lord Darroch believes a Joe Biden victory could present a problem for Boris Johnson's government. ""I think Joe Biden is an anglophile, but I think that a UK-US trade deal may not the priority that it would be if it was a second Trump term,' he told Channel 4 News. He added some of Mr Biden's team were ""not massive fans"" of Mr Johnson but said the fundamentals of the US-UK relationship would likely be as strong as ever. Lord Darroch also said that 'most Americans have decided how they're going to vote' in next month's election.  'If you're going to vote for Donald Trump you will be impressed by the sort of superpower appearance, the theatre of his resurrection, his return to the White House,' he said. ""If you were going to vote Joe (Biden), you'd probably be appalled by the theatre and disturbed by the idea that he may be infecting the staff in the White House and some of his colleagues by his reappearance too soon. ""I kind of doubt that what's happened is really going to make much difference to the election."" Former pensions secretary Esther McVey explains why she voted against the regulations: Tory rebels fail to block rule of six regulations Boris Johnson has faced a backbench rebellion over Covid-19 gathering restrictions, as senior Tory MPs urged the prime minister to change direction. Twelve Conservatives voted against the rule of six regulations in England, while several others abstained after voicing concerns during an at times testy debate in the Commons.
 They questioned the rationale behind children not being exempt from the Government's restriction, which bans social gathering of more than six people.
 The motion on the regulations was approved by 287 votes to 17, majority 270, with Labour abstaining.
 Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, asked whether the Government had considered a ""rule of eight"" instead, and Tory Huw Merriman said he could not vote in favour of the motion as he fears the rule of six would ""do more harm than good"". Tory former minister Steve Baker added: 'We're hearing about people who are being destroyed by this lockdown, strong, confident people, outgoing people, gregarious people who are being destroyed and reduced to repeated episodes of tears on the phone.' Priti Patel 'living in a whole other reality on immigration' How the home secretary can blame the mess of the system after a decade in power on lefty lawyers and 'do-gooders' is unclear, writes Jess Phillips:  The government are distracting from their failings by returning to what they know - getting tough on immigration Heseltine joins anti-no deal rally Tory grandee Lord Heseltine is among MPs speaking at an online rally on Thursday against a no-deal Brexit.

Brexit: UK and EU negotiators making minor progress but 'big gulfs on big issues',0.375,Positive,"British and EU negotiators are making some progress on side-issues in Brexit trade talks but are still unable to find common ground on the big issues - with just a week to go until a make-or-break summit. With the clock ticking down to the European Council meeting, EU diplomats from member states have been briefed by the Commission that the two sides are close to a deal on social security rights. A round of talks last week were described as ""one of the most positive so far"" by diplomats, the Reuters news agency reports. ""We seem to be getting closer and closer to a deal, even though the no-deal rhetoric in public might suggest the opposite,"" an optimistic EU source told the news agency.  But EU and UK officials sounded a note of caution on the reports. One on the EU side said the claims of significant progress were not coming from Michel Barnier's team, while a UK official warned: ""A deal is possible but not certain."" Another EU source told The Independent that progress on social security issues was ""hardly a key topic"" and that there were still ""big gulfs on the big issues"". These major sticking point are the issue of fishing rights, and the extent to which the UK would align to EU rules - the so-called ""level playingfield"". It is these two issues that have seriously dogged talks, and which will require one side at least to move politically to unblock. Boris Johnson has said the UK will drop out of negotiations if nothing has been agreed by the end of next week's summit, which is due to take place on Thursday and Friday.  The EU side, too, says the end of the month is the last date a deal can realistically be agreed and then implemented in time to prevent a no-deal exit from the single market and customs union at the end of the year. Britain is trying to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU in record time to replace the benefits it enjoys from the economic trappings of EU membership. These benefits will end on 31 December when the transition period ends, following the ""political"" Brexit at the beginning of this year.
