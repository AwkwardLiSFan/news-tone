Campaigners in last-ditch push to protect farming standards post-Brexit,0,Neutral,"Campaigners are staging a last-ditch attempt to enshrine food safety and animal welfare standards in UK law after Brexit, as the agriculture bill returns this week for debate and a series of votes in both houses of parliament. The government is said to be adamantly opposed to legislating for a continuation of the high standards required under EU law, with farmers asked instead to rely on ministerial assurances that standards will be upheld after Brexit. A spokesperson dismissed concerns as 'unhelpful scaremongering.' Thousands of people signed online petitions and wrote to their MPs over the weekend, as green campaigners and farmers' groups raised awareness of the issue. The National Farmers' Union has gathered more than 1m signatures for its campaign, which is also supported by the chef Jamie Oliver. Farmers are concerned that allowing food to be imported that does not meet the UK's current safety and animal welfare standards will open the country up to inhumane and unsafe imports, and undermine domestic production. They are not convinced by assurances that ministers will uphold standards post-Brexit without a legally binding commitment in the agriculture bill. Several amendments thave been tabled in the bill's passage through the Lords, but most are likely to fall unless a last-minute deal can be found with wavering 'green Tory'MPs. Katie White, the head of campaigns at the World Wide Fund for Nature, said: 'MPs must seize this historic moment to support British farmers and protect the health of people and planet by voting through improvements to the bill that enshrine our high food and environmental standards in tough nature laws for generations to come.'The Guardian understands, however, that a sizeable Tory rebellion is unlikely and major concessions are likely to be rejected, although there could be compromise on other issues. Ministers have repeatedly said that chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef from the US would continue to be banned in the UK, but have offered less concrete assurances on other aspects of food safety. In the government's view, enshrining a commitment to EU or equivalent standards in the agriculture bill would tie the hands of negotiators seeking a post-Brexit trade deal with the US, which wants its agricultural producers to have full access to the UK market. Sonny Perdue, the US agriculture secretary, said last week: 'We absolutely will not agree to policies that restrict our methods of production to any other standards outside of this country [the US]. While we will absolutely accede to international standards of health and safety which we believe to very measurable and objective, we do not intend to abide by any types of methods of production based on perception or anything else that's not scientific.'The Future British Standards Coalition published a report on Monday showing that trade bills were possible even if the UK were to mandate higher standards in domestic law. The FBSC is concerned that current provisions in the agriculture bill have loopholes that would allow standards to be weakened without consultation. Under current government plans, the Food Standards Agency would prepare reports on foods and agricultural products and imports before they could enter the UK market. The reports would be sent to ministers, who would then make the decision on whether or not to accept the advice. Ministers could also change existing food and agricultural production standards without the need for a parliamentary debate or vote. The government has set up a Trade and Agriculture Commission to provide assurances that standards will be upheld, but it has been criticised as lacking real powers. A government spokesperson said: 'This government has been clear it will not sign a trade deal that will compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards, and claims to the contrary are unhelpful scaremongering. We are a world leader in these areas and that will not change. 'Chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef are not permitted for import into the UK. This will be retained through the EU Withdrawal Act and enshrined in UK law at the end of the transition period. The government is focused on getting trade deals that protect and advance the interests of our farmers and consumers. If a deal isn't the right one, we will walk away.'Campaigners are also hoping that an amendment on the use of pesticides may garner some support from MPs. Under the amendment, which had substantial support in the Lords, pesticide use would be restricted around schools, nurseries, hospitals and homes. There may also be further assurances from ministers on government plans to pay subsidies to farmers based on the actions they take to protect the environment, instead of payments based mainly on the hectarage of land they farm, as at present.

The Observer view on the information commissioner's Cambridge Analytica investigation,0,Neutral,"The 2018 Observer investigation into a hitherto obscure political consultancy sparked the most serious crisis yet to disrupt the world's secretive social media giants and shed terrifying light on how their collection of our data reshaped political campaigning. Today, Cambridge Analytica is a household name. But renewed controversy about the activities of the now defunct company demonstrates how our media and legislatures are still struggling to digest the full implications of the scandal. Last week, Britain's information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, announced she had wrapped up a long investigation into the use of personal data in political campaigning in a letter to parliament that warned of 'systemic vulnerabilities in our democratic systems'ù. The letter confirmed that Cambridge Analytica had exploited Facebook data and said that, as investigators closed in on the company, it drew up plans to take its data offshore to avoid scrutiny. The commissioner summed up how reporting on this topic, led by Pulitzer-nominated Carole Cadwalladr in the Observer, transformed the way that people around the world understood the value of their personal data and their relationships with social media giants. 'How people's information was being used became a dinner table topic, prompting undercover news reports, a TV dramatisation and a Netflix documentary,'said Denham. Denham underlined that the investigation led to fines on Vote Leave, Leave.EU and Facebook, with the latter 'given the maximum financial penalty we could levy'ù. Cambridge Analytica has since collapsed; if it hadn't, it would probably have attracted further regulatory action, she added. The investigation and its findings might have been expected to prompt alarm and a debate about protecting our data and our democracy. Instead, comment over the past week has largely dismissed its findings or misread them. Several focused on CA's purchase and use of commercially available personal data and software, as if that negated the exploitation of Facebook users' private profiles. But the company was always open about using commercial software and data; that was combined with information scraped from Facebook to give it an unmatched ability to profile US voters. One report claimed that the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) had '[dispelled] many of the accusations put forward by whistleblowers and digital rights campaigners'ù, listing concerns about Russian interference in Brexit and interference in the 2016 presidential election. Yet the ICO confirmed that CA and its partner companies held on to parts of the Facebook data until at least 2017 and used it for political campaigning. 'It is suspected'that those campaigns included the 2016 US presidential election, the ICO's letter notes. A devastating Channel 4 report claimed recently that Donald Trump's 2016 campaign worked with a team from Cambridge Analytica and used data to target black voters for suppression through ads on Facebook. On Russian meddling, the ICO said that possible evidence it had found of 'Russia-located activity'fell beyond its remit and had been referred to the National Crime Agency for further investigation. Beyond that, it noted no 'additional evidence of Russian involvement'in material on the CA servers it seized; it stretches credulity to present that as a full investigation into potential Russian influence on Brexit. Other reports focused on the ICO's confirmation of its earlier conclusion that CA was not actively involved in the Brexit referendum, while inexplicably ignoring its findings about the Canadian data company AggregateIQ (AIQ), which did work on the winning Vote Leave campaign and was described by whistleblowers as an unofficial 'department'of the scandal-hit firm. The ICO said there was a range of evidence demonstrating a 'very close relationship'with Cambridge Analytica's parent company, SCL, which included paying some of AIQ's Facebook invoices, but didn't untangle it further. AIQ denies having a relationship that went beyond that between a software developer and its client. Media reporting, including the Observer's, has always focused on AIQ. It was Cambridge Analytica employees, and figures from the unofficial Leave.EU campaign, who claimed in the aftermath of the vote that the company played a large role, before later back-pedalling. Critics of Cadwalladr's reporting argue that 'Cambridge Analytica's main data-related crime was overselling its own capabilities rather than actually hacking democracy'ù. Others have resorted to trolling and personal attacks, often laced with misogyny. Yet her exposure of Cambridge Analytica prompted political and judicial inquiries on both sides of the Atlantic and permanently altered public understanding of data abuse. It paved the way for sweeping changes to how social media companies regulate political campaigns and advertising. The ICO report confirmed massive mishandling of private data and its exploitation for political campaigning. The Observer is proud of its role in the exposure of these abuses. ",0,Neutral
Belgian ambassador throws King Charles II treaty into EU fishing debate,0.375,Positive,"All is fair in love and cod war. And with the EU's coastal states under pressure to give way on Britain's demands for greater fishing catches in its waters post-Brexit, any old argument is worth a try. When the issue of the future access of European fishing fleets was being discussed by EU ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday the Belgian government's representative, Willem van de Voorde, made a notable intervention. To the confusion of some, and the delight of others, the ambassador cited a treaty signed some 350 years ago by King Charles II which had granted 50 Flemish fishermen from Bruges 'eternal rights'to English fishing waters. It was an important historical footnote illustrating the long relationship between Belgian fishermen and British waters, Van de Voorde suggested. When the Privilegie der Visscherie was given in 1666, Bruges was part of the Southern Netherlands, controlled by Spain. The offer had been Charles's way of showing gratitude for the hospitality he received when he stayed there during the interregnum that followed the decapitation of his father, King Charles I, and his own restoration to the throne. 'I wasn't quite sure what he was on about but I think he was joking,'said one confused diplomat who had listened to Van de Voorde's intervention. 'But, then, you never know.'While the validity of the Belgian claim is somewhat unlikely, the tensions in Brussels over fishing access for European fleets from 1 January are very real. The UK has demanded a radical increase in fishing catches in its exclusive economic zone as it leaves the EU's common fisheries policy. Some in Brussels recognise the need to satisfy this demand - it was one of the key arguments made for Brexit during the 2016 referendum - certain coastal countries, including France in particular, are insisting on the status quo. During the same meeting of ambassadors, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, pointed out that EU revenues from fishing in UK waters was around £650m, compared with £150m for British fishing in UK waters. 'I think he was suggesting that there was an argument for a change in the balance,'said one EU source. 'It is going to be difficult though; no sign of France changing its mind yet.'On Thursday, France's European affairs minister, ClÈment Beaune, said Paris would not 'sell out' its fishing communities to get a deal. After meeting with his Dutch counterpart, Stef Blok, in The Hague, Beaune told reporters: 'Our fishermen will not be a bargaining chip for Brexit, they will not have to pay the price for Britain's choices. 'Beaune said a deal was still possible but 'not by sacrificing the interests of our fishermen. ' A bad deal would be the worst outcome. And so we are ready for a no-deal scenario, and we will not accept a bad compromise.'",0.625,Positive
Two-thirds of British voters think EU nationals should not have free movement,0.25,Positive,"Two-thirds of voters believe that EU nationals should have to apply to come to Britain rather than enjoy free movement, a new survey has shown. The latest in annual surveys of British attitudes to politics by the National Centre for Social Research found widespread support for ending freedom of movement once the transition period is over. However, the figure has been dropping since the 2016 referendum when almost three-quarters supported the ending of freedom of movement. After the 2016 referendum support for requiring EU migrants to apply for the right to live and work in the UK dropped from 74% to 62% in 2020. Most voters also appear to back the principle of treating migrants the same irrespective of their country of origin. As many as 58% said that it should be neither relatively easy nor relatively difficult for people from France to come to the UK, while much the same was true of people from Poland (58%), Pakistan (55%), and Australia (53%). Voters do think that the job someone does should make a difference but draw the distinction between 'skilled'and 'unskilled'workers that forms the basis of government new points-based immigration policy. While 80% believe doctors should be a high priority, only 18% say the same of bankers. And while just 19% believe hotel cleaners should have priority, as many as 60% feel that care workers should be a priority on the immigration system. As the UK prepares to leave the single market and the customs union at the end of 2020, new research from the British social attitudes survey reveals a nation that is still divided on the impact of Brexit. It shows a near even split on the impact of Brexit, with 51% believing the economy will be worse off as a result of leaving the EU and the same proportion saying they think the EU has undermined Britain's ability to make its own laws. Sir John Curtice, senior research fellow at the NCSR and politics professor at the University of Strathclyde, said: 'Our research challenges some of the myths that surround the Brexit debate. Voters did react adversely to the Brexit stalemate - but this reaction was to be found just as much among Remain voters as Leave supporters, while the experience seems to have stimulated rather than depressed voters' engagement in politics.'Trust in government has fallen away significantly since 2016. A similar survey in 2016 showed that 22% of people said they trust the government 'most of the time'or 'ò'just about always'ù, the highest level in NSCR surveys since 2007. By 2019 this had dropped to 15%, the lowest level recorded in over 40 years, with more than twice as many people, 34%, saying they 'almost never'trust the government. While the survey also shows that confidence in the government after the Brexit stalemate has been shaken, the public would like Britain to follow some EU leads. Some 80% want British airlines to continue to follow EU rules on flight compensation and 69% want to follow EU rules banning roaming charges by mobile phone companies. Overall, the Brexit process seems to have stimulated the public's interest in politics with an increased level of engagement in Westminster over the longer term. Between 1986 and 2013, just 31% said they had a 'ùgreat deal'or 'quite a lot'of interest in politics. Immediately after the Brexit referendum this increased to 42% and is still as high as 39%.

"Cambridge Analytica did not misuse data in EU referendum, says watchdog",-0.875,Negative,"The data watchdog has closed its investigation into Cambridge Analytica, concluding that the controversial data company did not directly misuse data to influence the Brexit referendum. Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, said her team also found no evidence Cambridge Analytica aided Russian intervention in the UK political process. However, she warned that the company's data protection practices were lax 'with little thought for effective security measures'and its activities raised broader concerns about the influence of technology in politics. Cambridge Analytica had repeatedly claimed in its marketing material to have '5,000+ data points per individual on 230 million adult Americans'ù, suggesting it had incredible power to micro-target individuals with suggestive political messaging using a giant psychographic database. However, the investigation concluded that 'based on what we found it appears that this may have been an exaggeration'and much of the company's activities followed 'well recognised processes using commonly available technology'ù.  The Information Commissioner's Office spent three years investigating the company, which collapsed in 2018. Cambridge Analytica's downfall led to a global debate on the use of data targeting in politics and a reckoning for major technology companies who were pilloried by governments around the world, prompting the introduction of restrictions on political advertising on major social media platforms. Denham said her team analysed 42 computers, 700 terabytes of data, 31 servers, and more than 300,000 documents as part of their investigation into potential data offences. In a letter to MPs she said that although there was no evidence of law breaches to justify enforcement action, Cambridge Analytica's activities 'confirms my earlier conclusion that there are systemic vulnerabilities in our democratic systems'ù. Denham said she found no evidence that Cambridge Analytica were actively involved in the EU referendum campaign, beyond an early proposal to work with UKIP which was not put into action. The successful Vote Leave campaign, run by Dominic Cummings, instead employed the services of AggregateIQ, a Canadian data targeting company which had historic links to Cambridge Analytica. Last month Cambridge Analytica founder Alexander Nix was disqualified from acting as a company director for seven years for 'offering potentially unethical services to prospective clients'including bribery or honey trap stings, voter disengagement campaigns, obtaining information to discredit political opponents, and spreading information anonymously in political campaigns. Cambridge Analytica's sister company SCL Elections has already been fined £18,000 for failing to comply with a request for personal data filed by US academic David Carroll. He wanted to obtain information on how he may have been targeted by Republican campaigners using the company's services during the 2016 presidential election. As part of its investigations the ICO also handed down a £500,000 fine to Facebook and smaller penalties to both Vote Leave and Leave.EU. ",-0.25,Negative
Gove says UK has '66% chance' of Brexit deal amid breakthrough,1.125,Positive,"Michael Gove has put the chances of a Brexit deal at 66% amid fresh optimism over a breakthrough on the dispute over state aid, one of the key sticking points in negotiations. The chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster said the high percentage chance of a deal 'sounded about right'when pressed about the talks during a session of parliament's Brexit select committee. But experts seized on remarks made by the UK negotiator Lord Frost at the same meeting over a potential state aid dispute resolution mechanism. 'I imagine we will be as assiduous users of it [dispute resolution] as the EU will be,'Frost said. He declined to detail how this governance mechanism would work but the fact it was mentioned formally was seen as new. 'This is a big shift,'said Sam Lowe, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform. The EU has been worried that the UK could achieve competitive advantage in future by pumping subsidies into failing companies but the UK had refused to share its own plans for subsidies post-Brexit, merely declaring the country would maintain a low-subsidy regime. 'I think what Frost was saying was that the UK has accepted that state aid is going to be subject to dispute resolution. This is the opening we were looking for to pave the way for an agreement on enforceability,'he said. State aid has been identified repeatedly as one of the biggest stumbling blocks in trade negotiations by both sides, but in a further indication of a breakthrough Frost said this was no longer the case. 'Fisheries is the most difficult issue remaining in my view, I think we've been clear about that but I would not want to suggest that any issue can't be solved.'He told the committee he thought that a deal was 'eminently achievable and could be achieved'ù, suggesting the prime minister's deadline of 15 October could be broken if there was an outline deal visible by then. 'My job is to get as far as we can before the 15th, and then I'll have to advise the PM as to whether the conditions for an agreement, the basis for an agreement are in place at that point,'Frost said, indicating that 15 October was not a red line. The outspoken Brexit supporter and Conservative MP Peter Bone told Gove he was struck by what he said was the 'optimistic mood about a comprehensive free trade agreement that is really good news for everyone'ù. The upbeat tone raised hopes that sufficient progress could be made to enter the 'tunnel'phase of intense negotiations by the time EU leaders meet next week. Earlier the Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney warned that the EU's Michel Barnier will not move Brexit talks into the tunnel phase unless he gets a 'very clear signal'from the UK that it is 'willing to show some flexibility and realism'in its approach to a deal. Boris Johnson spoke to the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, on Wednesday to outline the UK's 'commitment to get a deal'and 'underline a deal was better for both sides'ù. Conspicuously, there was no mention of state aid but a reiteration that 'significant areas of difference remain, particularly on fisheries'ù. Just talked to @BorisJohnson The EU prefers a deal, but not at any cost. Time for the UK to put its cards on the table. #EUCO #15-16October After the phone call Michel said in a tweet it was 'time for the UK to put its cards on the table'over a post-Brexit trade deal. Coveney told an Irish parliamentary committee on Wednesday that no one should be offended by the UK's desire to drive a hard bargain, but its refusal to budge on state aid and fair competition rules was 'very problematic'because it had agreed in detail to work at a solution when it signed the political declaration in January. 'Michel Barnier has been very insistent on this. He is not going to move this process into a more intensive phase, which many people will describe as a tunnel, to try to close out through it the remaining issues unless he gets a very clear signal from the UK that they're willing to show some flexibility and some realism around the need for fair and open competition between these two big economies,'said Coveney. Coveney warns EU will not respond to gun at its head. ""There's going to be no concession given for the UK agreeing to withdraw elements of the internal market .That's essentially creating a crisis to allow that crisis; solve the problem."" He said the finance bill, which is due to be published imminently, could unsettle or even collapse the talks. 'If the finance bill is introduced with that provision in it [to give UK ministers unilateral powers in Northern Ireland], I think many in the EU will see that as an indication that the British government simply doesn't want to deal because it would be a second piece of legislation designed to deliberately break the withdrawal agreement,'he told the Irish parliament's European affairs committee.

"Modern, multicultural and surprisingly liberal: this is the real 'red wall'",0.5,Positive,"The election of 2019 and the political climate surrounding it now feel like relics of a different age. But one of the key elements of those distant weeks has stuck around: the concept of the red wall, a byword for the post-industrial places in the Midlands, the north of England and north Wales that were once solidly loyal to Labour but now have new Conservative MPs. In the Guardian, Keir Starmer's speech to Labour's virtual conference was framed as urging 'red-wall voters to 'òtake another look at Labour''ù. Last week, protests by north-east Tory MPs about Covid restrictions were characterised as a 'red wall revolt'ù, while government plans to abolish district councils boiled down to an attempt to 'shore up the red wall'ù. For anyone curious about our new politics, there is the pollster Deborah Mattinson's recent book Beyond the Red Wall, the fascinating story of encounters with voters in three such places. Starmer and his people may be determined to revive Labour's bond with these areas, but elsewhere on the political left, there is unease about the red wall's sudden centrality. In some people's view, Labour's new attempt to begin a conversation with voters there by emphasising family and patriotism - themes Starmer returned to in Sunday's interview with the Observer - risks 'pandering'ù. There are suggestions that some former Labour heartlands are so reactionary that progressive politics should simply accept their loss and move on. These views reflect a received wisdom in our politics since the referendum of 2016: the idea of an England supposedly split clean in two. We all know the drill by now. Urban places are held to be liberal, future-facing and welcoming of immigration and cultural diversity. By contrast, the red wall and provincial England are supposedly authoritarian, nostalgic, monocultural and bigoted. This perhaps handily positions a sizable share of the country to the Tory side of a culture war, which recent reports suggest will be based around everything from alleged BBC bias to trans rights, to shipping asylum seekers around the world. Such provocations may demonstrate that politics has irrevocably changed, and voters have permanently realigned - and if that's true, Starmer's efforts to calm things down and appeal to people on either side of an unbridgeable divide will probably be doomed. Yet, as the old David Bowie song goes, this is not America, and the red wall is far from a Trumpian redoubt of hard-right politics. Its new relationship with Boris Johnson's Tory party feels tentative and provisional, as was evident in plenty of the conversations I had with Labour-Conservative switchers last December and embodied by an exchange with a man in Stoke-on-Trent who had just backed the Tories for the first time in his life, just before the polls closed. How did it feel, I wondered. His face screwed into a grimace. 'Not good,'he said. People had - and still have - a sense of the Labour party being distant and condescending (Mattinson's book captures people in red-wall constituencies seeing Labour as a party of 'naive and idealistic middle-class students '¶ arrogant kids boasting degrees but lacking life experience'ù), and biting disdain for Jeremy Corbyn. And when it came to Brexit, there was also a moral sense of an agreement that had not been honoured. 'We voted three years ago, and it's still not happened,'a man in the Nottinghamshire former mining town of Worksop told me. His wife then chipped in: 'What's the point in having a democratic country if they're not going to listen to the word of the voters?'Told to make a choice, people had done so, and then watched as the winning option failed to materialise. Such was the incisive appeal of 'Get Brexit done'ù: the fact that someone heeded the call does not automatically put them in the same ethical and political category as, say, Nigel Farage. Red-wall areas are not really the hidebound, reactionary places of some people's imagination. Many large places there - Walsall, Wolverhampton, Stoke-on-Trent, Bolton, Bury - are diverse and, in their own way, quintessentially modern. As they do everywhere else, attitudes in such places vary according to age, but the liberalising transformations that have changed society - on race, gender and sexuality - since the 1960s are often clear, even among people others might see as being stuck in the past. As Sunder Katwala, the director of the thinktank British Future, puts it: 'The social conservatives of 2020 are probably as or more liberal as the social liberals of 1990.'Whatever has happened recently in the red wall, he warns against interpreting it as a backlash 'against modern life and all of the gains of social liberalism in the last half-century'ù. Yes, people in such places voice anxieties and resentments about immigration and the benefits system. These views clearly fed into the vote to leave the EU and some people's recent support for the Conservatives, and they can sometimes be ugly and nasty. But these opinions are often impossible to disentangle from such on-the-ground issues as housing shortages and pitiful work opportunities. This is not to deny the existence of straight-up racism and other prejudices; the point is that most human beings are more open and accepting than they are often given credit for, and focused on the daily grind rather than furores that might be convulsing social media. A recent quote on the Vice website from a newly elected Tory MP speaks volumes: 'There's an interesting view by some within the party that red-wall seats will automatically not be as pro-LGBT. That's nonsense. People in red-wall seats in general just want to be allowed to get on and live their damn lives '¶ and they want everyone else to live their lives freely.'On the other side of England's divide, cities are equally full of nuance. It is worth remembering that in the 2016 referendum, a third of Asian voters supported leave (among black voters, the figure was 27%). Three-quarters of people who belong to an ethnic minority say they have a strong British identity (a trait they share with white non-graduates, and which is less prevalent among white left-leaning graduates). It is easy to ignore the social conservatism of many black and Asian voters, and the fact that some of them may be as open to certain narratives about family and country as white people. Everywhere, complexities abound. When I was a reporter, the first interviewee I ever recorded talking about latter-day immigration 'opening the floodgates'was a senior Muslim community figure in Leicester. In the buildup to the referendum, the place that convinced me leave might win was Handsworth in Birmingham, where South Asian businesspeople talked about voting for Brexit in terms of national and personal self-reliance. Of course, there was no implication of any affinity with the nativist right. But again, what people said highlighted the fact that values and attitudes are more mixed up than some accounts of stark, binary divisions suggest. Given that basic fact, it should not be hard to conceive of a left-leaning politics that begins to speak to people on the various sides of our national divides, not least after the pandemic has so vividly exposed Britain's deep social and economic inequalities, and the decades wasted by leaving them unchecked. The red wall is not lost to the Tories, nor as distant from the rest of the country as we might think. If we want rid of this grim government, moreover, our estrangements and divisions demand not to be accepted, but healed. '¢ John Harris is a Guardian columnist ",0.625,Positive
"With its legal action over this UK bill, the EU is showing it means business",0,Neutral,"So the European commission has raised the stakes. It has begun the rather lengthy process of article 258 enforcement proceedings against the UK. But the truth is, this was on the cards as soon as the UK published the internal market bill on 9 September 2020. The bill was always going to cause trouble in Brussels. As Brandon Lewis, secretary of state for Northern Ireland admitted in the Commons, it breaches international law in a 'specific and limited way'ù. The international law at issue is the withdrawal agreement, the divorce text negotiated with the EU to bring to an end UK membership. Specifically, the internal market bill gives ministers powers to breach aspects of the Northern Ireland protocol - part of the withdrawal agreement - on state aid and customs duties, and also the provision in the withdrawal agreement on direct effect (ie enforceability of the provisions in the protocol). It is, though, not a breach of the protocol that the commission is complaining about in the article 258 proceedings. This is because those powers given to UK ministers under the internal market bill have yet to be exercised. Instead, the commission is complaining about a more general breach of article 5 of the withdrawal agreement on the duty of good faith. Article 5 provides that the EU and UK must take 'all appropriate measures, whether general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising from this agreement and shall refrain from any measures which could jeopardise the attainment of the objectives of this agreement'ù. The commission made clear its displeasure the day after the internal market bill was published. It said the UK government would be in violation of the good faith obligation as the 'bill jeopardises the attainment of the objectives of the agreement'ù. For good measure, the commission said: 'The EU does not accept the argument that the aim of the draft bill is to protect the Good Friday (Belfast) agreement. In fact, it is of the view that it does the opposite.'In a direct rebuttal to Lewis, the commission said that if the internal market bill were adopted this would constitute 'an extremely serious violation of the withdrawal agreement and of international law'and the commission would not be 'shy in using'the legal remedies in the text. And so it has come to pass. During the transition period, which lasts until the end of the year, the commission has the power under article 131 to apply existing EU remedies 'as regards the interpretation and application of the agreement'ù. This includes the ability to start article 258 enforcement proceedings, the process used when a member state is in breach of EU law. The commission's letter of formal notice, published yesterday, is the first phase. After a month, if the commission is not satisfied with the UK's answer, it can issue a reasoned opinion to which the UK would have two months to respond. The commission can ask the European court of justice for interim measures and to fast-track the case. But usually cases take about 12-18 months. If the court of justice finds against the UK it issues a declaration; a failure by the UK to remedy the breach would lead to further enforcement proceedings brought by the commission and eventually a lump sum and/or penalty payment. But this is all years away. The first two stages already take the UK to the end of December 2020. By then, we shall know whether there is a deal on the future trading relationship. So this feels more like politics than law. But the EU is playing to its domestic audience too. Its own member states are breaching or threatening to breach the rule of law in other matters. It cannot be seen to be reprimanding them but taking no steps against the UK. In short, Britain is threatening to breach the withdrawal agreement - and the EU is not taking this lying down.

UK carmakers face higher tariffs as EU rejects component plea,-0.75,Negative,"British car manufacturers could face higher export tariffs with or without a Brexit deal after the EU rejected an argument that components from Japan used on UK assembly lines should be considered British. The car industry has maintained that parts for cars, vans and trucks that have been sourced in non-EU countries should be deemed British under the rules of origin system that will apply to all exports from 1 January when the transition period is over. But according to a letter by the UK Brexit negotiator, David Frost, this idea, known as 'cumulation'has been formally rejected in trade talks. 'The commission has made clear that it will not agree third-country cumulation in any circumstances, which we regret, but obviously cannot insist upon. 'I am sorry to say that so far they [EU negotiators] have neither been willing to discuss these nor share any proposed text with us,'Lord Frost said in a letter seen by the BBC. Rules of origin go to the heart of the question as to whether the British car industry is manufacturing or assembly. Typically, to qualify as British after Brexit, products must have about 60% local parts or ingredients by value. Even if a deal is struck between the EU and the UK allowing zero tariffs on exports from Britain, vehicles that do not have enough British components will typically attract a tariff of about 10%, making them less competitive than EU-sourced cars and lorries. The British industry, which includes Jaguar Landrover, Ford, Vauxhall and Nissan, relies heavily on an EU supply chain but also on parts sourced in Japan and Turkey. Frost has reportedly told the industry that the EU has also rejected the UK's request for electric cars, batteries and bicycles to be treated leniently under the rules of origin system if the majority of components come from elsewhere. The letter says: 'I am sorry to say that so far they [EU negotiators] have neither been willing to discuss these nor share any proposed text with us.'While the letter is a blow to the British car industry, which two weeks ago warned of 'catastrophic'£100bn losses if a trade deal is not struck, it has been alert to the issues since the referendum in 2016. The industry was one of the most vocal campaigners for a soft Brexit aligning Britain to EU rules and had some success with Theresa May's version of the withdrawal agreement. Two years ago it disclosed that the average content of cars built in the UK that was British was about 44%, which would automatically mean it would fall foul of the rules of origin system. Over the past two years, the auto industry has consistently warned of the deep cost of no deal on the sector, which employs 14.6 million people across the EU and UK directly and indirectly in factories, component supplies, engineering, design and marketing and sales. They hope this latest warning from the combined forces of leaders in the EU and the UK will help both sides see past their political differences and strike a trade deal. ",-0.625,Negative
Lib Dems vote to push for renewed EU membership in long term,0.125,Positive,"The Liberal Democrats have voted to push for renewed UK membership of the European Union, but only as 'a longer-term objective'ù, as the party used its annual conference to begin a post-Brexit process of rebranding. The party, which won just 11 seats at December's election on a platform that included a pledge to rescind Brexit without a public vote if its then leader Jo Swinson became prime minister, has been seeking a way to reconcile its pro-European stance with the reality of departure. A frontbench motion on Europe at the party's online-only annual conference this weekend focused mainly on efforts to fight against a no-deal Brexit, and secure the rights of EU citizens in the UK. It also condemned the internal markets bill proposed by Boris Johnson's government, which includes a pledge to breach international law in redrawing the Brexit departure deal, as something which 'trashes the UK's reputation, sets a dangerous precedent and almost certainly precludes any chance of a free trade agreement with either the EU or the USA'ù. The motion, as initially tabled, said only that the party would 'keep all options open for the UK's future relationship with the EU, including membership at an appropriate future date'ù. However, a number of members, including some MPs, believed this was too watered down a commitment, and it was amended before it was voted through. The agreed version says the party will 'support a longer-term objective of UK membership of the EU at an appropriate future date to be determined by political circumstances, subject to public assent, market and trade conditions and acceptable negotiated terms'ù. Another possible amendment, which was rejected, gave a stronger commitment to 'campaign to rejoin the EU after the post-Brexit transition period ends'ù. Christine Jardine, the Lib Dem MP who speaks on Brexit issues, said the party would 'never turn our back on our pro-European values, because we are so much better off standing together than we could ever be alone'ù. She said: 'With our country already facing the biggest economic and health crisis in generations, it is unthinkable that the UK would crash out of the transition period without a deal. 'Boris Johnson must start putting the nation first, rather than sacrificing everything and anything in his ideological pursuit of Brexit. This is about stopping the disaster of food shortages, medicine shortages, and more.'",0.75,Positive
Firms plead for Brexit deal as coronavirus leaves industry reeling,0,Neutral," Almost half of British companies have warned that their Brexit preparations have been hit by the pandemic, as business leaders demanded a last-minute compromise to reach a trade deal and avert chaos at the border. As a crucial week of talks begins, more than three-quarters of businesses (77%) said they wanted a deal to be agreed, according to a survey by the Confederation of British Industry. Only 4% of businesses said they preferred a no-deal outcome. Support for a deal rises to 86% among distribution companies and 83% of manufacturers. Mixed messages have been coming from Downing Street and Brussels over the likelihood of a deal. No 10 had been talking up the possibility of an agreement after months in which no progress has been made - with the chances of a no-deal Brexit significantly increasing. However, Brussels remains concerned that Boris Johnson is showing no willingness to compromise over sticking points such as fisheries and state aid rules. The government's refusal to withdraw the internal market bill, which threatens to 'disapply'parts of the Northern Ireland protocol already agreed by the two sides, continues to pose a major obstacle. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has told ministers from the remaining EU countries that there was 'a more open atmosphere at the negotiating table'but that 'substantial differences of opinion remain'ù. Businesses are already struggling. The CBI's latest growth indicator found that private sector activity fell in the three months to September, but at a slower pace than last month: at -23%, compared with -39%. Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI's director-general, pleaded: 'Now must be the time for political leadership and the spirit of compromise to shine through on both sides. A deal can and must be made. 'Businesses face a hat-trick of unprecedented challenges: rebuilding from the first wave of Covid-19, dealing with the resurgence of the virus and preparing for significant changes to the UK's trading relationship with the EU. 'A good deal will provide the strongest possible foundation as countries build back from the pandemic. It would keep UK firms competitive by minimising red tape and extra costs, freeing much-needed time and resources to overcome the difficult times ahead.'Business concerns have been rising again after warnings about tailbacks at Dover if no deal is reached when the Brexit transition period ends on 1 January. Last week, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said lorries will require a permit to enter Kent in an attempt to stop logjams. He also admitted that in a 'reasonable worst-case scenario'only 50% to 70% of large businesses would be ready for new post-Brexit border controls. Meanwhile, there has been continuing fallout from the internal market bill. Ministers have admitted that it breaches international law in a 'specific and limited way'ù. The EU could start infringement proceedings as soon as this week. Hundreds of lawyers have written to their MPs complaining about the move. The Law Society said that 20% of the 5,000 people who have taken part in its Defend the Rule of Law letter-writing campaign were its own members. A Law Society spokesperson said: 'We launched a campaign action encouraging people to write directly to their MP about the rule of law and the internal market bill. In just one week, just under 5,000 people contacted their MP through our tool alone, making this one of the largest actions the Law Society has seen.'",0,Neutral

"Covid means UK needs EU deal to avoid calamity, says Lord O'Donnell",0,Neutral,"The combination of a no-deal Brexit and a second wave of Covid-19 represents such a serious threat to the UK that a trade deal with Brussels is needed to avoid a 'calamitous outcome'ù, according to the former head of the civil service. In a withering attack on the government's handling of the pandemic over the past six months, Gus O'Donnell - who headed the civil service under three prime ministers - will say on Thursday that the UK faces a perfect storm and that a trade agreement with the EU is 'absolutely imperative'to head off serious disruption. Lord O'Donnell will use the annual Institute for Fiscal Studies lecture to accuse the government of a range of failures - including weaknesses of strategy and leadership and a tendency to over-promise and under-deliver. Britain's Covid-19 record has been poor in comparison to its peers whether measured by the number of excess deaths, levels of wellbeing or the hit to economic activity, O'Donnell will say. He will accuse the government of having an obsession with soundbites at the expense of substance and a confused communications strategy that has left the public frustrated and baffled. O'Donnell will pose the question of why Britain, with its highly regarded health and intelligence institutions, has been so incapable of combatting the Covid-19 pandemic. 'In 2019, we were ranked second in the world for pandemic preparedness by the Global Health Security Index. A litany of new rules and a steady stream of leaks reflects a government struggling to emerge from firefighting mode,'he will say. 'Without a clear strategy, strong leadership and the use of good evidence from a range of human sciences, there is a risk that our efforts to emerge from this pandemic will be protracted and extremely costly.'Speaking just two days after Boris Johnson announced new restrictions for people living in England, O'Donnell will say government strategy is failing repeatedly because the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has been dominated by medical scientists whom the government instinctively defers to. 'However, the key to controlling the virus is changing people's behaviours. The government's incorporation of expertise from behavioural and other human sciences has been woeful. The weak 'òstay alert' campaign is an example of this. When the government says it 'òfollows the science', this really means that it follows the medical sciences, which has given it a one-sided perspective and led to some questionable policy decisions.'The criticisms levelled by O'Donnell - who served Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron as cabinet secretary - will provide fresh ammunition for the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, who has repeatedly accused Johnson of incompetence in recent weeks. O'Donnell will say that it is hard to see the abolition of Public Health England in the middle of the pandemic as anything other than a political attempt to deflect blame. 'Such moves can seriously deplete morale within institutions that are key to the pandemic response. More generally, the UK has one of the strongest scientific communities in the world and yet it is as though our institutions have simply not been built for handling this crisis.  'We need to look seriously at how to reform our institutions so that we are much more capable of responding to challenges like Covid. The government should be setting up a national Covid council modelled on the National Security Council, which would allow senior ministers and officials to consider (rather than just defer to) the opinions received from Sage.'",0,Neutral
'Cutting it tight': Dover port still awaiting Brexit infrastructure funds,0,Neutral,"Dover port is not Brexit ready because it is still waiting for government funds to be released for vital infrastructure for the new border operations, it has been revealed. It comes as it emerged that the government was considering forcing drivers to obtain a special Brexit passport before entering Kent in a bid to avert queuing chaos in January. Tim Reardon, the head of EU exit at the port, said the government was 'cutting it quite tight'with just 100 days to go before Brexit is implemented on 1 January. 'The government has a funding scheme which is due to open for application later this month. Clearly that's cutting it quite tight for stuff to be actually delivered and in place, when significant civil works are involved, by early next year,'he told MPs on the Treasury select committee on Tuesday morning. The money needed to be 'issued rather than talked about'ù, he said. Chair of the committee, Conservative MP Mel Stride, said the government appeared to be leaving it 'incredibly tight'and questioned why 'in the latter part of September'there was still 'talk about money being available for spades in the ground'ù. Reardon said he was confident the port itself would be ready but that not everything was in its control. His remarks come days after a leaked government 'border and protocol delivery group'document raised the prospect of queues of up to 7,000 trucks on British roads in the event of drivers, carriers and ports not being Brexit ready. One solution being mooted by the government is a special HGV passport, a Kent access permit (KAP), which would only be issued to drivers who had completed their paperwork before boarding ferries or Eurotunnel trains. Labour MP Angela Eagle asked whether this would mean police guarding roads into Kent, raising the prospect of a Brexit border within the landmass of Britain. 'Who's going to be patrolling the Kent borders to make sure that no lorry goes into Kent if it hasn't got that passport?'she asked. 'Where are the border posts for going into Kent going to be? It's all very well saying we are going to need it, but are we going to have Kent border police or border guards?'Confirmation of the KAP details are expected next week when the second border operating model is issued by HM Revenue & Customs. Also eagerly awaited are details of how goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be treated. Sources said that behind the scenes 'good progress'had been made at the UK and EU joint committee, which Gove chairs with the European commission vice-president, Maro≈° ≈†efƒçoviƒç, and that the chances of security declarations being waived were good. This is despite the explosive row between the EU and UK over the internal markets bill. It was confirmed on Tuesday that the committee will resume its work on Monday fuelling hopes of a breakthrough on Northern Ireland. ",0,Neutral
Theresa May says 'reckless' Brexit bill risks UK's reputation,-0.25,Negative,"Theresa May has launched a blistering attack on the government's plan to give itself powers to renege on the special arrangements for Northern Ireland in the Brexit deal. She described the plans as 'reckless'and 'irresponsible'and said they 'risked the integrity of the United Kingdom'ù, as they would not only tarnish Britain's reputation globally as an upholder of the law but could contribute to a reunited Ireland. In a strongly worded speech in the House of Commons, she said: 'I cannot emphasise enough how concerned I am [that] the Conservative government is willing to go back on its word to break an international agreement signed in good faith, and to break international law.'Sitting beside two former Conservative party Northern Ireland secretaries, Karen Bradley and Theresa Villiers, and Sir Bob Neill, who threatened a backbench rebellion against the government, she said there could never be a time a minister could walk through the voting lobbies and say yes to breaking the law. May said the bill would also mean trust would be undermined in future negotiations with other countries. 'So much for global Britain,'she quipped. The Belfast South MP, the SDLP's Claire Hanna, said Boris Johnson's government had to own the consequences of the type of Brexit it agreed and should not 'feign shock'when nine months later it emerged there would be trade barriers between east and west. 'The government is acting recklessly and irresponsibly with no thought to the long-term impact on the standing of the United Kingdom in the world. This will lead to untold damage to the United Kingdom's reputation. It puts the future of the United Kingdom at risk. And, as a result, with regret, I have to tell the minister I cannot support this bill,'she said. The bill, which is designed to regulate trade within the UK after Brexit, was unveiled by Downing Street two weeks ago, catching Conservative MPs, opposition parties and the EU off guard. A backbench rebellion, now thought to have been brought under control by Downing Street, emerged when it became clear the bill included three clauses that would allow the government to disapply parts of the Northern Ireland protocol without regard to the co-signatories of an international treaty. The Northern Ireland Office minister Robin Walker defended the clauses, saying they were needed to ensure nothing in the protocol of the withdrawal agreement 'prevents unfettered access from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK'ù. But May hit back and said there were three reasons why clauses 41 to 45 had 'no place'in the bill and could weaken support for Westminster in Northern Ireland. 'That, in turn will lead to some communities having less willingness to trust the United Kingdom government and that would have a consequence on the willingness of people in Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom,'she said. 'So, far from acting to reinforce the integrity of the United Kingdom, in pursuit of trying to appear to be tough to the European Union, I think the government is putting the integrity of the United Kingdom at risk,'the former prime minister added. The former Tory party leader Iain Duncan Smith said he did 'not believe a word'of claims that breaking international law would undermine trust in the UK because, he said, the EU itself broke international law.

Thousands of Britons living in EU told their UK bank accounts will be closed,0,Neutral,"Thousands of Britons living in the EU will have their UK bank accounts closed by the end of the year because of the UK's failure to agree a post-Brexit trade deal. Lloyds, Barclays and Coutts have informed retail and business customers that they will lose their accounts before or when the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December and more banks are expected to follow suit. Lloyds Banking Group, which includes Halifax and Bank of Scotland, has contacted its 13,000 customers in the Netherlands, Slovakia, Germany, Ireland and Portugal, warning them they must make alternative arrangements as the bank is no longer allowed to offer services. A spokesperson said: 'We have written to a small number of customers living in affected EU countries to let them know that due to the UK's exit from the EU, regrettably we will no longer be able to provide them with some UK-based banking services. 'We want to keep customers informed and offer advice on next steps.'Financial services in the UK can currently trade across the European Economic Area (EEA) because member countries are bound by the same regulatory framework. The arrangement, known as 'passporting'ù, expires at the end of the year and, while the UK has legislated so that EU banks can continue to provide services for customers in Britain, the EU has not done the same. Unless a trade deal is agreed with the EU, UK financial institutions will have to abide by often arcane rules which vary from country to country and depend on what services are being offered by what kind of bank. Last week, the Dutch National Bank confirmed that UK banks will no longer be able to provide current or savings accounts to retail customers in the Netherlands. Customers who bank with firms that own EU-based subsidiaries are having their accounts transferred, but banks that do not have an EU arm would have to apply for a licence to trade in each EEA country. Some banks have too small a customer base in the EU to justify the cost. One Lloyds customer said she feared she would be cut off from her UK pension payments after the bank had informed her she would not be able to use her current and savings accounts after 2 November. Her balance will be returned to her as a cheque and all payments after that date will be returned to sender. 'I don't know what will happen about tax rebates from HMRC or council tax and bills on the property we own in the UK,'she said. 'ò'I don't know if it's possible to arrange direct debits and standing orders to UK institutions from a Dutch bank and there will be a lot of expense incurred if payments that skip through the net are returned to sender or if I have to convert euros to sterling whenever we are in the UK.'Barclays has also notified customers across the EEA that their accounts will be closed. One who lives in Germany was told she would no longer be able to use her Barclaycard, which she depends on for transactions within the UK. The customer, who did not want to be named, said: 'I've had the card for 40 years and pay it off each month from my pensions, which are paid into my UK account, so I'm not sure I'd qualify for a German credit card,'she said. She said she owned a property in the UK and paid taxes in the country and that she wanted 'to maintain my financial arrangements there in case I ever need to live there again'ù. A Barclays spokesperson said: 'In light of the UK leaving the EU at the end of 2020 we continue to review the services we offer to customers within the EEA, and any impacted customers will be contacted directly.'Other banks have yet to decide on future arrangements. Santander and NatWest said they were keeping the situation under review and currently had no plans to withdraw retail or corporate accounts. HSBC, which has a large number of customers in France, Germany and Switzerland, said that as an international bank it could continue to serve UK customers across the EU, but would keep them informed of any changes that might affect services. UK financial services are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority which said it expected banks to engage with national regulators to assess the impact of local laws on customers and to inform customers of any changes in a timely manner. According to the financial trade body UK Finance, banks are having to unpick the legislation of 30 different countries to work out if they can continue serving customers. 'Where possible, firms want to keep providing banking services to customers living in the EEA after the transition period,'said a spokesperson. 'The impact on each customer will vary depending on the operating model of their bank or provider, the product or service being provided, and the legal and regulatory framework in the country in which they are resident.'",0,Neutral
Why Geoffrey Cox's A Man for All Seasons clip sends Brexit Britain a potent message,0,Neutral,"It is fascinating to find Sir Geoffrey Cox, the former attorney general, posting on Twitter a scene from Robert Bolt's A Man for All Seasons to affirm his belief in the sanctity of the law. Since Bolt was a one-time communist, an active supporter of CND and a dramatist who wrote a hagiographic portrait of Lenin in State of Revolution, he and Cox make strange bedfellows. Yet, although Bolt was ready to defy the law in pursuit of a cause like nuclear disarmament, he still saw it, in his own words, as 'the essence of organised society'ù. pic.twitter.com/wwNjpFFvC1 Cox's choice of a clip from the film of A Man for All Seasons is highly pertinent but, to understand it fully, you need to know the context. Sir Thomas More has just been confronted by Richard Rich, who is part of the network of spies Thomas Cromwell is using to gather information about him. Once Rich has gone, More is urged to arrest him. More's response is that what Rich is doing may well be evil but that it's not illegal. He places his faith in the inviolable integrity of the law. Destroy that and anarchy follows. As More says: 'This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coast and if you cut them down do you think you could really stand upright in the winds that would blow then?'It's a powerful message for today. Cox seems to have got the point. As a parliamentarian, he's not famous for his humility: indeed he appears the antithesis of the More portrayed by Paul Scofield in the film, who was the epitome of quiet modesty. However, when Cox said this week that 'the breaking of the law ultimately leads to very long-term and permanent damage to this country's reputation'he was speaking sentiments More might have understood. Perhaps he could arrange a clandestine showing of A Man for All Seasons for Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, and Suella Braverman, the attorney general, who seem all too happy to cut their consciences to suit the current Tory fashion. But while it's good to see Fred Zinnemann's film being used to make a moral point, it started out as a stage play and is only one of many in the 20th century in which the individual is pitted against authority. Bernard Shaw's Saint Joan shows its protagonist taking on the Catholic church and, unlike Bolt's More, putting God's law above man's. Arthur Miller's The Crucible, dealing with the Salem witch trials of 1692 but highly relevant to the hearings of Senator McCarthy's House Un-American Activities Committee, shows a hero who sacrifices his life to his principles. And Bertolt Brecht's Galileo depicts a pioneering scientist who abjures his beliefs when faced with the Inquisition. Bolt's play, when it opened in 1960, was openly compared to Brecht's: not always in its favour as shown in a celebrated argument with Kenneth Tynan in the pages of the Observer. But Bolt stuck to his guns and argued that More was right to pin his faith to the primacy of the law, and against those who 'were ready to crack it open and let in anarchy to maintain their own advantages'ù. Not a bad phrase to apply to the age of Johnson and Cummings. ",0,Neutral
Brexit: consortium of companies led by Fujitsu wins £200m Irish Sea contract,0.625,Positive,"A £200m contract to implement Brexit checks on goods in the Irish Sea has been won by a consortium of companies led by Japanese company Fujistu. HMRC announced on Friday that a two-year contract for the new trader support service (TSS) had been awarded to a consortium led by the tech company and its partners, the Customs Clearance Consortium, an organisation run by customs expert Robert Hardy and the Institute of Export and International Trade. The latter counts among its patrons the former Ulster Unionist party leader Reg Empey, who is listed as one of the organisation's vice-presidents. Lord Empey said he had no involvement in the bid and his role as patron was entirely honorary. The winning consortium, which also involves McKinsey consultants, said it was 'very pleased to be the successful supplier'of what will be 'a free service available to all traders moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and importing goods into Northern Ireland from the rest of the world, which will help them to comply with new requirements under the NI protocol'ù. Empey was vehemently opposed to any Brexit deal that involved trade barriers down the Irish Sea but more recently called on cabinet ministers to stop denying their existence in the Brexit deal. In July, he said the 'attempt to hide from the reality is doing no service to business or the general public'as the protocol made clear 'there will be a border in the Irish Sea'and these would be implemented on 1 January trade deal or not. On Friday, he said he found the row between the UK and the EU over the checks as a 'deeply deeply worrying'development. 'The way both sides are using this place [Northern Ireland] as a bargaining chip is disgusting,'he said. Businesses in Northern Ireland welcomed the trader support service, which effectively nationalises the Brexit bureaucracy for local businesses. Seamus Leheny, policy manager for Logistics UK for Northern Ireland, said the TSS work would need to commence immediately. He said Fujitsu and its partners had huge task and responsibility. He added: 'The TSS will need to be on their top game if it's to succeed.'Consultant Shanker Singham, one of the leading advocates of 'alternative arrangements'to Theresa May's backstop solution was not named in the government announcement but is known to have advised the bidders. With the backing of former Conservative MP Nicky Morgan and the Tory MP Greg Hands, he worked closely with Fujitsu in developing an alternative system for Irish border checks last summer involving technology and mobile units away from the border. The £200m contract is the first concrete implementation of the special Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland. Hinduja Global Systems is also in the consortium. Earlier this week, the government gave the go-ahead for a second tender for works for sanitary checks at ports in Northern Ireland. HMRC said TSS would go live at the end of September so businesses can register for support and start preparations for the end of the transition period. It said: 'The Trader Support Service will provide unprecedented support to all businesses engaging in new processes under the NI Protocol and its announcement has been warmly received by them.'Fujitsu, the Institute of Export, Singham and Hardy have been approached for comment.

Brexit: Trump envoy warns of risk of Ireland 'border by accident',-1.125,Negative,"Donald's Trump special envoy to Northern Ireland has warned of the risk of creating a hard 'border by accident'on the island of Ireland, as Boris Johnson's newly drafted plan to rewrite the withdrawal agreement was rejected again by the EU. Mick Mulvaney, who was appointed by the US president in March, admitted to concerns about recent developments, including government legislation that could unilaterally override aspects of the agreement on Northern Ireland struck with Brussels last year. 'Everyone assures me that no one is interested in seeing a hard border between the republic and Northern Ireland,'the former acting White House chief of staff said in an interview with the Financial Times. 'We appreciate that, we respect that and we agree with that. The one thing I keep trying to assure is on the front of everybody's mind is avoiding a border by accident. The Trump administration, state department and the US Congress would all be aligned in the desire to see the Good Friday agreement preserved to see the lack of a border maintained.'The comments follow a critical intervention by the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, after the UK government published its internal market bill and admitted it would breach international law. 'We can't allow the Good Friday agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit,'Biden tweeted. The speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, has also warned that Congress will refuse to ratify any UK-US trade deal that comes before it if the British government fails to abide by the terms of the withdrawal agreement. The internal market bill aims to enforce compatible rules and regulations regarding trade in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some rules, for example around food safety or air quality,† which were formerly set by EU agreements, will now be controlled by the devolved administrations or Westminster. The internal market bill insists that devolved administrations† have to accept goods and services from all the nations of the UK - even if their standards differ locally. This, says the government, is in part to ensure international traders have access to the UK as a whole, confident that standards and rules are consistent. The Scottish government has criticised it as a Westminster ""power grab"", and the Welsh government has expressed fears it will lead to a race to the bottom. If one of the countries that makes up the UK lowers their standards, over the importation of chlorinated chicken, for example, the other three nations will have to accept chlorinated chicken too. It has become even more controversial because one of its main aims is to empower ministers to pass regulations even if they are contrary to the withdrawal agreement reached with the EU under the Northern Ireland protocol. The text does not disguise its intention, stating that powers contained in the bill 'have effect notwithstanding any relevant international or domestic law with which they may be incompatible or inconsistent"". The bill passed its first hurdle in parliament by 77 votes, despite a rebellion by some Tory MPs. Martin Belam and Owen Bowcott Mulvaney said he had discussed the internal market bill with the Irish government and that he was closely monitoring the debate over it. His comments will be seen as all the more significant given they come from a Republican figure close to the White House. 'I feel there's so much left to be decided on Brexit including the [internal market bill]. I see nothing in particular that would inevitably lead to a hard border, but again I am simply concerned that everyone be aware of the potential risks,'he said. 'We're going to wait and see because the underlying EU-UK trade discussion could end up mooting the [internal market bill].'Under the withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland will stay in the single market, including its state aid rules on domestic subsidies, and the full EU customs code will be enforced on goods crossing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This would require refundable tariffs to be paid on goods that are 'at risk'of moving through Northern Ireland and on to the Republic of Ireland, if a wider 'zero tariff, zero quota'trade deal between the EU and the UK is not struck this year. The internal market bill and an upcoming finance bill will give ministers the power to limit the reach of the EU's state aid laws where they might go beyond Northern Ireland and impact on businesses in the rest of the UK from next year. Ministers would also be given the power to decide unilaterally what goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland would be judged to be 'at risk'of moving into EU territory. The bill would additionally ensure that no export declarations were required for goods entering Britain from Northern Ireland. There are concerns that the failure of the UK to live up to its promise to enforce a regulatory and customs border in the Irish Sea could lead to the need for such checks to occur on the island of Ireland, a position that all sides are determined to avoid. Following an outcry by Tory MPs, Downing Street on Thursday clarified that it would only ask parliament to override parts of the Brexit agreement if the EU undermined the 'fundamental purpose'of the Northern Ireland protocol. In the deal brokered with the rebels, the government said it would also seek to use the dispute resolution mechanisms in the withdrawal agreement at the same time as implementing the contentious clauses in the internal market bill. While some EU diplomats saw the government's move as 'promising'ù, senior EU officials close to the trade negotiations insisted the bill's contentious clauses remained a breach of the withdrawal agreement. One such official said the UK was still seeking to negotiate 'with a gun on the table - albeit not cocked'ù. 'It's better than more escalation. But '¶ it's trailing more breaches of the withdrawal agreement to come in the finance bill which is hardly reassuring.'One senior diplomat said the EU had been 'distressed and appalled'by the UK's attempt to unilaterally rewrite the withdrawal agreement but that the EU was determined to continue the talks. 'Because it's two separate tracks: one is the withdrawal agreement which the UK has decided to violate, and the next is going to be the future relationship,'the diplomat said. 'We'll see at the end of the month what the state will be then.

The Guardian view on animal welfare: keep it up,-0.25,Negative,"Hunting, scientific experimentation, entertainment, the keeping of pets, farming, fishing, habitat destruction: there is no one story about the way that humans use animals - and cause them to suffer. So far, the UN reported this week, our collective efforts to protect wildlife globally have not succeeded. All 20 of the Aichi biodiversity targets agreed in Japan a decade ago have been missed. But a gloomy big picture must not blind us to smaller, positive changes. In January, wild animals in circuses became illegal in Britain. Last month, the use of glue traps to catch birds was stopped by President Macron in France. Historically, the UK has played an important part in the development of laws protecting animals. Along with Sweden, it led the way on welfare rules in Europe with an influential report, setting out 'five freedoms'to which farm animals should be entitled, published in 1965. The freedoms were the space to turn around, lie down, stand up, stretch, and groom. Having been made law in the UK in 1990, a ban on rearing veal calves in crates became EU-wide in 2006. It was followed by a ban on crates for pregnant sows. Yet this record, of which many British people are rightly proud, is now in danger. Despite committing in their 2019 manifesto to uphold the UK's environmental, animal and food standards, Conservative ministers are now refusing to rule out allowing imports from countries, including the US, that have no federal animal welfare standards at all. Instead of a ban on meat or dairy produced under conditions that would be illegal here, the government proposes a dual-tariff system, under which goods that don't meet domestic standards would be charged more on entry. So far, chlorine-washed chicken has been the main bone of contention in the debate over the place of US agribusiness in the post-Brexit food system. The safety concerns surrounding the use of chlorine, as well as the antibiotics and hormones routinely fed to US farm animals to promote growth, and GM ingredients, are all serious issues. Dilution of hard-won protections against food poisoning and other health effects, and an increased risk of environmental damage, is not what the majority of Brexit supporters thought (or were told) that they were voting for when they chose to leave the EU. But animal welfare is also an important factor. So is the regulatory framework governing the treatment of workers. While it must not be assumed that the giant animal factories in which US meat production is concentrated necessarily have lower hygiene and other standards than smaller or European farms, many experts believe that huge numbers of animals kept in close proximity represent a health hazard to humans, as well as causing suffering to both animals and workers. There is no call for starry eyes. Current standards leave much to be desired. An EU inquiry into the flouting of livestock transport laws was announced in June. The shocking extent of poverty in the UK, after 10 years of austerity and in the middle of a pandemic, means that food price rises are a serious worry. But while this might make the prospect of cheaper food tempting, deregulation is not the answer. Instead, we must keep fighting for a food system that balances human needs and tastes with values.

Brexit: Boris Johnson makes fresh concession to Tory rebels,-0.25,Negative,"Downing Street has clarified that it would ask parliament to support using powers to override parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement only if the EU undermines the 'fundamental purpose'of the Northern Ireland protocol. Boris Johnson brokered a deal with Conservative rebels on Wednesday to see off a potential party revolt, agreeing to grant MPs a vote before invoking powers in the UK internal market bill that would break international law by breaching the EU withdrawal agreement. In a fresh concession to rebels, No 10 published a policy paper on Thursday setting out the circumstances in which it would use the powers, as well as confirming that the government would also seek to use the dispute resolution mechanisms in the withdrawal agreement at the same time. The government's deal with backbenchers, a group of whom were supporting senior Tory MP Sir Bob Neill's amendment to give parliament a veto over use of the measures in the bill, came on Wednesday hours after the resignation of Lord Keen, the UK government's law officer for Scotland. In its policy paper on Thursday, the government explained that it will ask parliament to support the provisions in the relevant clauses 'only in the case of, in our view, the EU being engaged in a material breach of its duties of good faith or other obligations, and thereby undermining the fundamental purpose of the Northern Ireland protocol'ù. Under the Northern Ireland protocol, Northern Ireland would continue to enforce EU customs and follow product standards rules to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. No 10 also confirmed that 'in parallel with the use of these provisions, it would always activate appropriate formal dispute settlement mechanisms with the aim of finding a solution through this route'ù. The internal market bill aims to enforce compatible rules and regulations regarding trade in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some rules, for example around food safety or air quality,† which were formerly set by EU agreements, will now be controlled by the devolved administrations or Westminster. The internal market bill insists that devolved administrations† have to accept goods and services from all the nations of the UK - even if their standards differ locally. This, says the government, is in part to ensure international traders have access to the UK as a whole, confident that standards and rules are consistent. The Scottish government has criticised it as a Westminster ""power grab"", and the Welsh government has expressed fears it will lead to a race to the bottom. If one of the countries that makes up the UK lowers their standards, over the importation of chlorinated chicken, for example, the other three nations will have to accept chlorinated chicken too. It has become even more controversial because one of its main aims is to empower ministers to pass regulations even if they are contrary to the withdrawal agreement reached with the EU under the Northern Ireland protocol. The text does not disguise its intention, stating that powers contained in the bill 'have effect notwithstanding any relevant international or domestic law with which they may be incompatible or inconsistent"". The bill passed its first hurdle in parliament by 77 votes, despite a rebellion by some Tory MPs. Martin Belam and Owen Bowcott Examples of behaviour prompting the use of the measures included in the internal market bill would include, the government said on Thursday, the EU refusing to grant third-country listing to UK agricultural goods for 'manifestly unreasonable or poorly justified reasons'ù. Other examples listed include an insistence that GB-NI tariffs and related provision should be 'charged in ways that are not related to the real risk of goods entering the EU single market'ù, as well as an insistence on export declarations for NI goods going to GB. The former Tory leader Lord Howard, who backed Brexit but has been an outspoken critic of the government's bill, said the compromise 'isn't enough'for him to back it in the Lords. 'The government is still asking Parliament to break international law,'he told the BBC on Thursday. Even with the changes, he described the chances of the bill being approved by the Lords as 'not great'ù.  He added: 'I don't know what my colleagues will do, but as far as I'm concerned this is a matter of principle.'While some EU diplomats saw the government's move to compromise with rebels as 'promising'ù, senior EU officials insisted that the contentious clauses in the internal market bill remained a breach of the withdrawal agreement. 'It may convince the Commons, but not the EU,'said a senior European diplomatic source who said Brussels would scrutinise the legal text as it emerged. 'It is still a violation of the withdrawal agreement, but is an interesting development all the same.'A second senior EU official said the UK was still seeking to negotiate 'with a gun on the table - albeit not cocked'ù.  Brussels is now viewing the last week of September and the first two weeks of October, before an EU leaders' summit on 15 October, as 'very crucial'to the outcome of the trade and security negotiations. One senior diplomat said the EU had been 'distressed and appalled'by the UK's attempt to unilaterally rewrite the withdrawal agreement, but added that the bloc was determined to continue the talks. 'Because it's two separate tracks: one is the withdrawal agreement which the UK has decided to violate, and the next is going to be the future relationship,'said the diplomat.  The EU is examining two main options: taking the UK to the European court of Justice or continuing the negotiations and then presenting the British government with the choice of dropping the relevant clauses of the internal market bill in order to secure a trade deal or leaving without an agreement. 'It is up to the UK now,'said an official. The bill passed its second reading in the Commons on Monday evening by a majority of 77 despite a group of Tory MPs abstaining. A joint statement issued on behalf of Neill, Damian Green MP, chairman of the One Nation caucus, and 10 Downing Street on Wednesday evening said the government had agreed to table an amendment to the internal market bill at committee stage. Writing in the Telegraph last weekend, Johnson claimed that he had been anxious in recent weeks as negotiators believed there was a 'serious misunderstanding'about the terms of the withdrawal agreement. 'We are now hearing that, unless we agree to the EU's terms, the EU will use an extreme interpretation of the Northern Ireland protocol to impose a full-scale trade border down the Irish Sea,'he wrote.

"Brexit bill hugely damaging to UK's reputation, says ex-ambassador",0.125,Positive,"Britain's former ambassador to Washington has described the internal market bill as 'hugely damaging to our international reputation'ù, warning that it could deter other countries from entering into agreements with the UK in the future. Kim Darroch told the Guardian that if it becomes law, in violation of the withdrawal agreement signed with the EU last year, it would endanger the country's prospects of achieving trade deals with the EU and the US, and have an enduring impact on its global standing. 'It is the most astonishing thing I can recall through my entire public service career: a minister said we are knowingly breaking international law,'said Darroch in an interview. Over the course of a 43-year career at the foreign office, he served as envoy to the EU in Brussels and national security adviser, before becoming ambassador to the US. 'It's potentially hugely damaging to our international reputation. It puts at risk future international agreements, if people think the Brits are just going to say: we didn't like this on reflection, and we would like to rewrite this part unilaterally,'the retired diplomat, now Lord Darroch of Kew, said. The bill survived its latest parliamentary hurdle on Monday night, passing its second reading in the House of Commons by a margin of 77 votes.  Governing the flow of goods and services between the UK's four constituent nations, the bill stipulates it takes precedence where it contradicts elements of the withdrawal agreement, and the British government has admitted that would break international law. Darroch said the impact could be first felt in negotiations with the EU to establish new trade relations after Brexit. 'I've talked to a few people in Brussels, and they are determined not to just walk away from the table because of this. It's equally inconceivable you would get the UK-EU deal through if this passes into law,'he said. The effect of the bill on Northern Ireland would have other ramifications, particularly if it led to customs checks on the border with the Republic of Ireland, something the withdrawal agreement was designed to prevent. The return of a hard border would jeopardise the 1998 Good Friday agreement, to which the US is guarantor. 'The UK-US deal is at risk because, even if Donald Trump is reelected, it's quite hard to see the Republicans taking back the House [of Representatives],'Darroch said. 'And as long as the House is in Democratic hands, the leadership have made it clear that a UK-US free trade deal wouldn't be possible if we put at risk the Good Friday agreement.'Darroch was forced to resign as ambassador to Washington in July last year after his reports back to London on the turmoil and dysfunction in the Trump administration were leaked. Donald Trump declared his officials would no longer deal with the UK ambassador, and Boris Johnson, who was at the time running to replace Theresa May as prime minister, failed to offer Darroch a clear statement of support. The former diplomat gives an account of his turbulent time in Washington in a memoir, Collateral Damage, published in the UK on Tuesday. Darroch speculated the internal market bill could be a negotiating ploy to force concessions from Brussels. If so, he said, it was not a very good one. 'If we were to back down or find a way through with the EU, that would limit the damage, but the fact that we contemplated it is still damaging,'he said. 'The downsides, with the EU free trade deal, the US free trade deal and our international reputation are so big, I can't quite believe they will carry through on it.'",0.25,Positive
PM calls EU tactics 'extreme' while defending breach of international law,0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson accused the EU of preparing to go to 'extreme and unreasonable lengths'in Brexit talks as he defended breaching international law amid a mounting rebellion from Tory backbenchers. The former chancellor, Sajid Javid, became the most senior of the prime minister's past cabinet colleagues to say they could not support the UK internal market bill prior to a Commons vote on Monday night. Javid joined two former Conservative attorney generals, Jeremy Wright and Sir Geoffrey Cox. David Cameron, one of Johnson's predecessors, had earlier expressed 'misgivings'about the creation of powers to row back on elements of the withdrawal agreement involving Northern Ireland. All five living former prime ministers have now expressed concern about the bill. More than 20 Tory MPs are expected to withhold support for the bill but most will abstain unless the government makes concessions on giving parliament a vote on the new powers before the vote. The internal market bill aims to enforce compatible rules and regulations regarding trade in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some rules, for example around food safety or air quality,† which were formerly set by EU agreements, will now be controlled by the devolved administrations or Westminster.

The bill passed its first hurdle in parliament by 77 votes, despite a rebellion by some Tory MPs. Martin Belam and Owen Bowcott Whips told some MPs the threat of withdrawing the Conservative whip had not been ruled out if they rebelled. In a nod to some angry MPs, Johnson said he would never invoke the controversial powers in the internal market bill if a Brexit trade deal was reached with the EU. He said the UK would 'simultaneously pursue every possible redress under international law, as provided for in the [Northern Ireland] protocol'- a measure suggested by Cox. Opening the debate in the Commons, the prime minister claimed the EU was willing to 'use the Northern Ireland protocol in a way that goes well beyond common sense, simply to exert leverage against the UK in our negotiations for a free trade agreement'ù. Johnson said the measures in the bill - which would hand unilateral powers to ministers in key areas yet to be agreed with the EU, breaching the terms of the treaty agreed in January - were 'a protection, it's a safety net, it's in an insurance policy, and it is a very sensible measure'ù. He said threats from the EU, which the bloc has denied, had made the legislation necessary, claiming the bloc could prevent food exports from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That claim drew incredulity from the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, who responded for Labour. He said the bill did 'precisely nothing'to address that issue, offering mockingly to give way to Johnson in the Commons if he had found anything in the bill that dealt with the 'supposed threat'ù. 'He didn't read the protocol, he hasn't read the bill,'Miliband said. 'What incompetence, what failure of governance, and how dare he try and blame everyone else? This is his deal, it's his mess, it's his failure.'Intervening in Johnson's speech, Wright raised the ministerial code which he said bounds ministers to respect international law. Earlier the former attorney general had said he along with many others, were 'profoundly disturbed by what's going on'ù. Two former barristers - Cox and Rehman Chishti, who quit as the special envoy on religious freedom - also told the government they would not back the bill, along with former solicitor Gary Streeter. 'There is concern among some lawyers in parliament about what effect this would have on their practice after they leave parliament - the bar has made its view very clear,'one MP said. The debate also saw the first of the 2019-intake of Tory MPs decline to back the bill. Imran Ahmad Khan, who represents Wakefield, said: 'Moral authority is hard-earned and easily lost.'Javid, who quit the cabinet earlier this year, said it was not clear why international law had to be broken and that he was 'regretfully unable to support the UK internal market bill'unamended. He added the UK should wait until it was clear the EU intended to act in bad faith and until then use safeguards already enshrined in the withdrawal agreement. Others planning to abstain include Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, who said: 'Everything is getting very high-octane, and the collateral damage to Britain is reaching the US Congress, where people are bewildered we are going down this avenue. 'Many of us are conflicted because I came into politics to further Britain's place on the international stage, and now we are at a time where there is an absence of political leadership, and we can't hold our heads up high if we are being seen to challenge international law.'Most MPs with concerns about the bill will be expected to abstain rather than vote against, saving their ire for votes next week where amendments will be tabled. Asked whether Tory MPs who rebelled on Monday night could lose the whip, Johnson's spokesman stressed it was 'critical'that Conservatives backed the bill. An amendment next week has been put forward by the chair of the justice select committee, Bob Neill - another former barrister. It would require parliamentary approval before any future decision could be made by the government to disapply the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement. Those backing the Neill amendment include the former cabinet minister Damian Green, the QC and former justice minister Oliver Heald, the Northern Ireland select committee chair, Simon Hoare, and Damian Collins, former chair of the culture select committee, who are all expected to withhold support for the bill. The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain's entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a 'deep-seated hostility'towards the European project. With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home. The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted ""yes"". Margaret Thatcher, later to be leader of the Conservative party, campaigned to remain. Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the ""iron lady"" marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand 'our own money back'claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back'despite being one of the 'three poorer'members of the community. It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.† Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in 'embryo'ù. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU. Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was 'òno, no, no' to what she saw as Delors' continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch's Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered 'Up yours Delors'front page. A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of 'a single market without barriers - visible or invisible - giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world's wealthiest and most prosperous people"".

Brexit: Sajid Javid among Tory MPs expected to abstain or vote against bill,0,Neutral,"More than 20 Conservative MPs, including the former chancellor Sajid Javid, are expected to rebel or abstain at the vote on Boris Johnson's internal market bill, which the government admits will break international law. The government has not ruled out the possibility that rebels could lose the Conservative whip, though most prominent names are expected to abstain at this stage of the bill.

'This is a piece of legislation that delivers a vital legal safety net in order to ensure that the integrity of the United Kingdom can be protected, and it is critical that MPs pass this bill before the end of the year,'he said. Asked whether it would thus be treated in effect as a confidence issue for the government, he replied: 'As I said, it's critical that we get this legislation passed and on the statute books before the end of the year.'More Tory MPs said on Monday they planned to abstain on the legislation with a number hoping the government will back an amendment next week by the chair of the justice select committee, Bob Neill - another former barrister - which would require parliamentary approval before any future decision could be made by the government to disapply the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement.

A cuckoo leadership out to ruffle feathers,0,Neutral,"Martin Kettle concludes his article (This Brexit bill finally buries the Conservative party of law and order, 9 September) by suggesting that 'the government actively seeks disorder'and that this is 'a very different kind of Tory party from any of its predecessors'ù. Surely this is the point? The party that governs this country is not the Conservative party, but the Cuckoo party, which, like its avian cousins, has no scruples about ejecting the legitimate occupants of the 'nest'to further its interests. The cuckoos are an evolved species of the Farageist breed, led by an unelected algorithm, controlling a puppet, to manipulate the public and party. Boris Johnson is the ideal frontman. Together, using the Conservative label, they have succeeded in occupying the space of authentic Conservatives to deliver a version of the party that bears no resemblance to the original model. No wonder regions are now considering secession from the union. Unless parliamentarians of all parties unite to drive these interlopers out, England will be reduced to an isolated, corrupt, poverty-stricken outpost of an empowered EU.

"Boris Johnson's new bill will damage the union, and with it devolved government",0.25,Positive,"The government's new 'internal market'was initially portrayed as a means to allow for the 'seamless functioning'of commerce between England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. So it's paradoxical that the presentation of the internal market bill to parliament this week cast fresh doubts over not only this 'seamless'functionality, but on the sustainability of the devolved settlement itself. The bill had already sent shockwaves through the north and south of Ireland before it was published. Rumours circulated that Westminster intended to unravel legally binding arrangements for Northern Ireland, prompting new anxieties about the prospect of a hard border. The shock resignation of the permanent secretary to the government legal department over the legal consequences of the bill heightened fears. Brandon Lewis, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, admitted prior to publication that the Brexit strategy breaks international law. Much of the contention surrounds the bill's regime of mutual recognition, which requires regulatory standards for goods to be the same across the four nations. Politicians in devolved assemblies believe it will, in practice, mean a race to the bottom to match the low regulatory standards thought to be favoured by Conservatives. The bill will also give politicians in Westminster a say over infrastructure projects - which some in Wales have interpreted as giving London a means to, for example, revive plans that have been rejected by the Welsh assembly.  Nicola Sturgeon described the bill as 'an abomination on almost every level'and a 'no-holds-barred, full-frontal assault on devolution'ù. Handing Conservative UK ministers powers to overrule the Scottish parliament, the SNP argues, opens the door for corporations with deep pockets to capture Scotland's policy space. Areas such as food, health, agriculture and the environment may be dragged to the lowest common denominator as they are shaped increasingly by Westminster - or, more specifically, by the UK's future trade deals.  All of this matters, especially in the context of the UK's trading position. The country has shifted from being a member of the world's largest single market to seeking trade deals alone and from an ever more isolated position. This enfeebled bargaining hand, coupled with the presence of predatory US corporate lobbying groups desperate to get their hands on the NHS and accelerate deregulation, threatens to drive a dramatic reimagining of our economy and society. The Scottish government is not alone in its fury at the internal market proposal. The Labour-run Welsh government accused Westminster of 'stealing powers'from devolved administrations and sacrificing the future of the union. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, described the bill as an 'enormous power grab'and Wales' counsel general, Jeremy Miles, called it it 'an attack on democracy'ù. David Melding, a Welsh Conservative shadow frontbencher, resigned in protest. In Northern Ireland, Nichola Mallon, the minister for infrastructure, stressed that 'devolution deserves respect not contempt'ù. The UK government's motivation remains murky. It may simply see the devolution settlement as a necessary victim of its broader power play with Brussels. What seems more likely, particularly given this government's taste for a high-stakes gamble and centralising power, is that this bill is part of a deliberate move to shore up power in London or the beginning of a gradual reseating of power from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The internal market bill will weaken the authority of devolved parliaments to shape the policy landscape at a period when scrutiny has seldom been more vital. The UK is battling with a public health crisis, the turbulence of Brexit, the prospect of mass unemployment, one of the deepest recessions in three centuries and the challenge of securing trade deals. It is even more important, amid the seismic shifts in our economic landscape, that devolved governments are empowered. The settlement is ultimately a struggle rooted in questions of where power rests, and who is able to shape the future of our economy and thus our society. Cast your mind back to the final days of the Scottish independence referendum and Gordon Brown's intervention, arguing for a system of government as close to federalism as you can have in the UK. The reality of this promise is yet to transpire and rhetorically we are even further from it than we were six years ago. In the short period that Boris Johnson has been prime minister, he has already started what could be a fundamental reordering of the UK constitution. His government has attempted to reduce accountability, disempower our courts and strengthen the power of Westminster. Despite all of the rhetoric about the need to treasure the union, the Conservatives' actions have actively harmed its future.

Boris Johnson is trashing Britain's reputation. Labour cannot stand by,0.375,Positive,"Call it Barnard Castle-ism. Dominic Cummings' belief that inconvenient rules can be broken has become the animating creed of this government. Except now it's articulated even more brazenly than Boris Johnson's evil not-quite-genius ever dared. After all, Barnard Castle only entered the language as a byword for a laughably convoluted excuse because Cummings didn't want to admit he had violated the lockdown. This week the cabinet minister Brandon Lewis showed no such reticence. 'Yes, this does break international law,'Lewis told the House of Commons, speaking of the government's new internal market bill; but only, he said, adding the feeblest of qualifiers, 'in a very specific and limited way'ù. Since then, British politics has been consumed with an argument you would have thought didn't need to be made: the case for the rule of law. It's so fundamental, we're not used to spelling it out, but here goes. The alternative to the rule of law is the law of the jungle. If individuals or countries can pick and choose which rules they keep and which rules they break, that benefits the strong and powerful but leaves everyone else vulnerable. Safety comes only when the law applies as much to the lion as the lamb. More directly, a Britain that declares its willingness to break international treaties - including one it signed only a few months ago - announces itself as a rogue state, by definition. As the former Tory leader Michael Howard argued, such a country will never again be able to scold, say, Iran if it breaks its nuclear promises, or China when it reneges on its commitments to Hong Kong. We will have amputated the finger we like to wag in the face of others. If all that sounds too high-minded, let's put it in terms that might register with even the most devoted Brexiter. There's no 'global Britain'if Britain is known as the country that breaks its word. All those sparkling new trade deals that will supposedly compensate for losing our place in the world's largest, freest trading bloc will evaporate as potential partners back away from a nation that admits to defaulting on its obligations. Nancy Pelosi, who as US House speaker heads the body that would have to ratify any US-UK trade agreement, said as much on Thursday: if Britain unpicks the Irish border accord, there'll be no trade deal with the US. Baffled, she asked: 'How can they walk away from an international agreement? How do you trust that?'Far from heeding the warnings of some of our closest allies, the government is rushing ever faster into the abyss. It plans to fast-track its law-breaking bill, bringing it to the Commons on Monday. And yet we can hardly consider ourselves surprised. This is a government that introduced itself to the nation by breaking the law with its 'prorogation'manoeuvre a year ago, illegally suspending parliament when that body got in its way. Ever since, it has set about removing any person or institution that might act as a check or balance on its power, hacking away at the foundation stones on which our democracy rests. Johnson purged his benches of dissenting MPs and now, more alarmingly, is purging the upper reaches of what should be an impartial civil service. Six senior Whitehall officials have gone this year, the latest being the head of the government's legal department, who resigned rather than serve a government that acts illegally. Johnson and Cummings have picked a new cabinet secretary, one apparently willing to do their bidding: on Thursday he issued a statement reassuring civil servants that they're not breaking their code by serving a government that breaks the law. At the start of this month, Johnson broke a long summer spell of invisibility to attack the BBC over the confected Rule, Britannia! row, because a trusted national broadcaster is yet another pillar of the democratic architecture that our prime minister and his outsourced brain regard as constraining their power. Naturally, when the government takes a mallet to any of these pillars, it insists it's serving the 'will of the people'ù. But the attempt to rewrite the withdrawal agreement exposes the smirking emptiness of that slogan, because it confirms that Johnson and his ministers hold the people - including their own voters - in contempt. The electorate approved that agreement in the December election, having been told it was not only 'great'ù, 'fantastic'and 'wonderful'but done, dusted and oven-ready. Tinkering it with now is to laugh in their faces. Who, then, will stand up to Johnson? It's been heartening to see former Tory leaders line up to condemn their successor, though it's long overdue. They should have seen from the start that Brexit was always at odds with the principles claimed by traditional Toryism. The party that once professed to prefer proven institutions to wild ideological schemes chose to ditch an established, effective body in pursuit of an abstract dream of absolute sovereignty. The party of unionism agreed to put a border down the Irish Sea. Regretting that now, the party of law and order breaks the law. But this week confirms that Brexit stands at odds not only with conservatism, but with the doctrine plenty of Tory MPs would regard as more precious: Thatcherism. For Margaret Thatcher regarded the rule of law as a sacred British value. What's more, Cummings is driven by his desire to escape EU rules barring state aid, so that the government can start subsidising favoured businesses. Such state subsidy was anathema to Thatcher. 'Cummings is on his way to destroying everything Tories hold dear,'says one MP and former minister, who tells me he has a speech resigning the Tory whip written and ready in his top drawer. He can't bear what he sees as Cummings' burn-it-down revolutionary anarchism: 'We didn't see him coming because he's coming from the right.'He says his fellow moderates are waiting for an imagined final battle to confront Cummings and his boss. 'But history shows there isn't one final battle. It's a series of capitulations.'In his view, Cummings knows he won't be able to deliver materially for the northern 'red wall'seats the party won from Labour last year, but reckons the Tories can retain their 2019 coalition by fuelling a constant culture war, attacking liberal institutions, and casting Labour's Keir Starmer as 'Captain Woke'ù. Seen like that, Starmer was right this week to avoid Johnson's trap and say nothing about the law-breaking admission. Don't sound like a remainer lawyer; leave it to others; stick to Covid. I'm sure those are smart tactics; I get it. But sometimes the moment demands more. When a government declares that the rule of law is no longer absolute, the foundations of democratic life begin to tremble. There is a way to make the case without sounding like an Islington QC. You can quote Thatcher, or channel the patriotic Labourism of Clement Attlee, insisting that Britain's word must mean something in the world. However you choose to say it, it needs to be said.

The Tories aren't incompetent on the economy - they know exactly what they are doing,-0.5,Negative,"There is no alternative'was the mantra of British politics from the 1980s to the very recent past. To bring about change it was necessary to unleash enterprise, or globalisation, or technology. Politics was about staying out of the economy, and coping with the social consequences. But there always was an alternative - it is just that the loudest voices denied it. As Adam Tooze has noted, the state never left the economy, it just changed its role, and its visibility. Since the 1980s the economy has been actively reshaped by a series of political-economic decisions by successive activist governments. Over the years, the aims of British political-economic policy have changed. Once, the main concerns were the national rate of growth, the national balance of trade, reducing inequalities within the boundaries of the nation, and strengthening the nation compared with others. Since the 1980s, and by these measures, things have not got better. Neither under Thatcher nor under New Labour, let alone more recently, did the UK achieve the rates of GDP growth of the 1950s and 1960s. Since the 1980s the balance of trade has stayed systematically worse than in the 1950s or 1960s. In relation to goods it is at the previously unthinkable level of -6% of GDP. Nor has the acquiescence to the supposed necessities of economic realism transformed the UK's relative position. The levels of efficiency of the British economy are still lower than those of France and Germany, to roughly the same extent as in the 1970s. The UK manufactures less than Italy and France, and a third of what Germany does. Germany exports much more outside the EU than the UK, and, deliciously, its exports to the Canzuk countries (the fantasy potential British superpower of the dimmest Brexiters: Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK) are twice UK levels. The English north is poorer than the regions that used to make up communist East Germany, and the north-east is poorer than the poorest German province. Nor has the new post-national economy thrown up transforming British entrepreneurs and firms. Where are the world-beating British firms to replace the supposedly dozy giants of past? There was lots of talk of startups and venture capital and all the rest. But after 40 years, where are the results? When pressed for examples of great entrepreneurs, I get given the same tedious list of an operator of airlines and railways, a maker of vacuum cleaners, a pizza chain owner and the designer of Apple phones. And then there is ARM (which makes the crucial chips used in Apple phones and elsewhere, which was sold to the Japanese Softbank in 2016) - indeed a successful firm, but one with origins in the despised 1970s, perhaps the last moment of serious British creativity. Note too that British R&D was higher as a proportion of GDP in the 1970s than it is today. It was higher still in the early 1960s. The object of political-economic policy since the 1980s has not been to make a better British national economy. It has been directed at changing the balance of power in the country, to open the economy up to the world, essentially to make the rich richer and more powerful. The Thatcher revolution was fundamentally a rulers' revolt. While inequality of all kinds was driven down by policy in the 1940s, 50s and 60s, it was pushed back up by policy from the 1980s. Similarly regional disparities, which had been huge before 1939, were reduced after the war. In the post-war years the state transformed infrastructure, from electricity to the telephone, from gas to housing, to an astonishing degree. Since the 1980s these public assets have been privatised, handed over to a new class of rentier capitalist to sweat and to extract monopolistic rents. In 1954 the economist W Arthur Lewis published his theory of the dual economy, to describe the economic problem of underdeveloped countries, with a mass of workers who would work for very little, and a small rich sector, which liked it that way. The US economic historian Peter Temin has cheekily applied that model to the recent history of the US, where the mass of wages have been stagnant since the 1970s, the rich have got richer and the old middle class has shrunk. On a lesser scale something similar has been done to the UK. We now have the enclave economy of London with its rich professionals, with offshoots elsewhere, and for much of the rest of the country effectively a low-wage, low-productivity economy, where the minimum wage is often a maximum too. As Temin noted in the US, the hyper-rich control politics. This too has happened here. Indeed, as Peter Geoghegan shows, the Brexiteer-Thatcherites are the local British branch of US culture warriors, climate deniers and haters of the EU. Brexit has exposed the political nature of the economy. But don't be fooled into believing that the Brexiters will reverse the policies of the last 40 years. They are not economic nationalists, nor do they care about economic sovereignty or about rebuilding the nation. They are not Lexiters in disguise, rediscovering the 1970s Brexiter nationalist politics of Tony Benn. They are radical Thatcherites, who have to believe that the British economy has been turned into a world-beating one by Thatcher's policies. They have to deny the painful reality they are handing out contracts not to world-beating British firms but to shipping lines without ships, PPE suppliers without PPE, to crony, not creative, capitalists. But don't be fooled either by critics' talk of their incompetence or lack of ideas. They know what they are doing, and are succeeding. Their aim is to further change the economy, even at the expense of growth. Like Margaret Thatcher's indifference to the waste of unemployment, and the 2010 coalition's lack of concern about the ways in which austerity caused the economy to stagnate, the Brexit hit will in their view be a price worth paying. It's the politics, stupid. It always has been. '¢ David Edgerton is the author of The Rise and Fall of the British Nation: a Twentieth-Century History ",-0.125,Negative
No one who has experienced food poverty would stand by and let it spread like this,-0.125,Negative,"I'll never forget trying to feed myself and my son on £10 a week. I was a single mum, absolutely skint and living hand to mouth, even after I started working as a trainee reporter for the Southend Echo, following 18 long months of looking for a job. So, for those first shifts until a pay cheque arrived, food meant a Tupperware tub of cold pasta with a spoonful or two of cheap pasta sauce from a jar, which, weirdly, is cheaper than buying tinned tomatoes to make your own. And, when you've got no money, every pinch of herbs or flavour becomes a luxury. Years later, although my circumstances are better now, I still feel guilty about using too many ingredients in one dish, and I hoard dried pasta and canned tomatoes for rainy days - a whole monsoon, judging by my store cupboard. Dried pasta can be had for 20p to 30p for half a kilo and if, like me, you were feeding two mouths for £1.40 a day, every penny saved was a penny towards something else. Britain is a country where food poverty is an almost invisible national scandal. Almost invisible because, although we see the food bank boxes at the end of the supermarket checkouts when we shop, the people who are going hungry tend to tuck themselves away. The stigma and shame of poverty, and of not being able to afford to feed yourself and your family, means that people sometimes don't seek help, they don't talk about their situation. I hid my circumstances from friends and family for almost a year before one of my blog posts went viral and they found out. People were upset that I hadn't asked for help, but I didn't want to admit how much I was struggling. I was worried they might think I was an unfit parent, and I was just about keeping up appearances, or so I thought. In Britain right now it's about to get a whole lot worse. Figures released last week have trumpeted falling shopping prices but these are entirely on non-food items. Fresh food prices are creeping up slowly and 'ambient foods'- the stuff we put in our cupboards, shelf-stable and able to be kept without the need for a fridge or freezer - are going up in price at between two and three times the rate of inflation, jumping 2.8% in August. It may not sound much but, to anyone already struggling to feed themselves or their family, that 2.8% means one thing: hunger. Back in the days of my £10 weekly food shop, that rise would equate to £14.56 a year or, if you prefer, a week and a half with no food for me or my son. You see the difference small rises can make? Ten million adults in England, Wales and Northern Ireland face food insecurity every year; 2.5 million young people in Britain are estimated by Unicef to live in 'food-insecure'households. 'Food insecure'- it's such a sterile way of describing the disgusting reality that, in 21st-century Britain, millions of us are afraid of going hungry. These figures predate the coronavirus pandemic, which, of course, has only made things far worse. Food transport costs have gone up because there are fewer flights operating. Unemployment is on the rise and, for those lucky enough to have jobs, wages have been cut and job security in many sectors is shaky. Here's another thing. When Britain completes the next stage of its never-ending European divorce on 31 December, prices are expected to go up again. Importers will have to deal with new regulations, hauliers will face new delays and, unless there's some remarkable 11th-hour trade agreement, tariffs will be slapped on food imports. Experts who drew up the recent Affordable Food Deal report estimated that the price of basic foods such as pasta and tinned tomatoes could go up by 10-20% in the event of no deal. Where on earth are people in poverty expected to find an extra 20% in their food budgets? It should not be necessary for figures such as the footballer Marcus Rashford to fight on behalf of hungry children. It should not be necessary for charities such as the Trussell Trust to feed families via food banks. And while Covid-19 has caused a spike in food bank use, the figures have been growing alarmingly for the last few years - and the welfare and support system has been broken for a long time. Food banks and charities supporting food aid are, at best, a short-term fix. They shouldn't be a replacement for a decent support structure in our society. We need to implement long-term changes, and fast. Changes such as the increase in Healthy Start vouchers championed in the government's National Food Strategy, which can be done literally at the push of a button, would transform lives overnight by giving more people more money for fruit, vegetables and milk. We can help resolve food poverty by supporting a living and livable income for people who are employed, between jobs or receive state benefits. That isn't a straightforward categorisation in itself: most benefits are paid to people in work, which means our taxes are bailing out the poverty-level wages paid by corporations who dole their profits out to shareholders rather than their staff. Think about that for a moment and see how messed up it is, and then join the campaigns for paying living wages. If you're in employment, join a union, because organising yourself and your colleagues against unfair working conditions is going to be crucial as the next wave of recession hits. The government can also avoid actions that drive food prices up, such as allowing our trade to default to a position that imposes needless and expensive tariffs on the basics and staples in our shopping baskets. Not that that's a concern of many of those in power, but I suggest, before they continue with this act of national harm - because it will cause serious harm to millions of people - that everyone responsible for the trade negotiations should try feeding two people for a tenner a week. I also suggest they get some pasta in before the prices go up again. '¢ Jack Monroe is a campaigner, columnist and author ",-0.875,Negative
British farmers will be trampled in the rush for free trade deals,0.375,Positive,"As he fielded PMQs on Wednesday, Boris Johnson wore a wool and wheat sheaf badge on his lapel. Behind him many of his MPs sported it too, as did Keir Starmer and Labour MPs: it was the symbol for Backing British Farming Day. But in the Financial Times, the National Farmers Union's combative leader, Minette Batters, was calling the Tories 'immoral and hypocrites'for refusing to vote to give parliament - themselves - the final say on any post-Brexit trade deals. If deals with the US, Australia or anywhere else threaten to flood the market with lower-quality food, produced using hormones, pesticides, antibiotics and chemicals, with weaker animal welfare standards, MPs should have a vote on that. A million people have signed the NFU petition calling for the government to ban any food imports of a lower standard in quality, welfare or environment. This has reached far beyond farmers, rousing food campaigners and animal welfare activists. Amendments are being put to the agriculture bill reaching the Lords next week, but to date all such attempts have been struck down by the government. Donald Trump has listed 'comprehensive market access for US agricultural goods in the UK'as a goal for any trade deal. Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, has given verbal assurances that food standards will not drop, but this is no 'my word is my bond'government. On Thursday, Brexit edges dangerously closer to a no-deal precipice. Once commentators sought method in the Boris Johnson cabal's politically perverse actions. No longer. Divining their political strategy is perplexing. Just brinkmanship, many hope - but others say their priority, above any sense of the country's good, is a determination to have no enemies on the right. They are still afraid of Nigel Farage's leery grin, as he waits to pounce on Brexit betrayal. Farming used to be part of the core identity of the Conservative party. But here's a reminder of what no deal and trading on WTO rules will do to farming and the much larger UK food industry: a 48% tariff will be slapped on British lamb exported to the EU, along with 57% on Cheddar, 37% on poultry and 84% on beef. At the same time the government says it will cut all import tariffs on 88% of products. That would wipe out hill farms in Cumbria, Scotland and Wales, and much other farming too. Add in free trade agreements not just with the US but Australia and elsewhere, and farming and the food industry will be massively undercut. It's not as if food is expensive here: only in Singapore and the US are food costs lower as a proportion of household income, says the NFU. Johnson would herald striking a US free trade deal as a triumph, yet his government's own estimates show it would raise UK GDP only by between 0.07% and 0.16%, and that's over 15 years. What's more, the US will insist on abolishing exclusive 'geographical indication'rights: Melton Mowbray pork pies or Cheddar cheese would lose their protected status, and could be made in Georgia. The mystery is why a majority of farmers voted for Brexit. On Wednesday I talked to Robin Milton, a sheep farmer and Brexit voter, in his tractor, driving up and down to trim his 20 miles of hedges on Exmoor. 'It was for the ideology of it,'he said. 'But the reality is going to be different.'Why does he still back Brexit? He thinks farmers like him remain optimistic: 'Any deal with the EU is always last minute, isn't it?'But if it's no deal, that's the immediate end of his sheep. 'I'll grow trees, but don't come asking me for sheep or a good landscape, that will be gone.'The NFU's director of EU exit and international trade, Nick von Westenholtz, says there are not many Brexit regretters among farmers - yet. 'They voted to get rid of hated EU red tape but there will be no reduction: it will be worse red tape for their exports. They were promised they could retain access to the EU single market and keep their farm support.'But they would lose that access and the government has only guaranteed them two more years of matching EU subsidy. Their subsidies will soon join the budget scramble for very scarce spending funds: farm subsidy will not fare well competing with other causes such as the NHS. On Back British Farming Day, Starmer, but not Johnson, met NFU farmers. Luke Pollard, Labour's shadow Defra secretary, himself from a farming family, says they listened, surprised to hear pleasing Labour ideas on increasing domestic food self-sufficiency, farm support post-Brexit, keeping high food standards and ensuring access to skilled farm workers: food and flower crops rotted this year for lack of them. Many 'red wall'seats, he points out, have large rural areas too. Somehow the idea that Labour could ever win over farmers seems far-fetched. But they are only one battalion of many traditional Tory voters who face bankruptcy and ruin if this government really does pursue a vandalising no-deal Brexit.

Boris Johnson's 'oven-ready' Brexit had a secret footnote: we'll rehash it later,0.125,Positive,"Everybody knows Boris Johnson can lie for England. To his supporters, it was one of his best assets. They believed he could bamboozle the European Union into giving him the only Brexit deal that is really acceptable - one that gives Britain all the advantages of being in the EU without any of the botheration of being a member. The problem is that congenital mendacity isn't just for foreigners. If you lie for England, you will also lie to England. This week, these two streams of fabrication finally became one. In openly admitting that it signed the withdrawal agreement with the EU in bad faith, Johnson's Vote Leave government also implicitly confessed that it lied wholesale to the electorate in December's general election. The cross-contamination of domestic politics by the deceit that is Brexit's DNA is now complete. On Tuesday, the Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis brazenly informed the House of Commons that a bill to amend the Irish protocol of the withdrawal agreement with the EU would 'break international law'ù, albeit in 'limited and specific ways'ù. The qualification is nonsense. If one side can unilaterally change any bits of a treaty, nothing in it is binding. But in any case, Lewis's declaration was part of a much wider contention: that the British never quite understood what they were signing. That same day, Johnson's court gazette, The Daily Telegraph, led with the headline 'Brexit deal never made sense, PM to tell EU'ù. The story quoted 'a senior government source'as claiming that some of its consequences 'were not foreseen'at the time and that the treaty would have to be 'rewritten to protect the union'ù. In itself, this claim is fraudulent. The idea that Johnson has suddenly realised that the protocol effectively keeps Northern Ireland within the ambit of the EU's customs union and single market, and thus has negative implications for the union, is risible. This was precisely what Johnson's close allies in the Democratic Unionist party were screaming about when he made the agreement in October 2019. It was the reason why Johnson himself had sworn blind to the DUP that he would never agree to such a thing. If Johnson didn't see that a radically different Brexit for one part of the UK would destabilise the union, he is an idiot. But in this case, he can be exonerated on that charge - he knew damn well and did it anyway. He did it for the same reason he and his Vote Leave crew do everything else: because it suits their immediate interests. Theresa May's Northern Ireland backstop was threatening to bring the whole Brexit project crashing down. The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, offered Johnson a way out - the so-called 'border in the Irish Sea'ù. Johnson, the supreme opportunist, grabbed it, screwed the DUP, declared victory and the rest is history. But this is where the real fakery starts. It is clear that Johnson and his most important confreres, Dominic Cummings and Michael Gove, never really saw this as anything other than a clever dodge, a tactical retreat. On his blog in March 2019, when May was in power, Cummings addressed 'dear Vote Leave activists'ù: 'don't worry about the so-called 'òpermanent' commitments this historically abysmal Cabinet are trying to make on our behalf. They are not 'òpermanent' and a serious government 'î one not cowed by officials and their bullshit 'òlegal advice' with which they have herded ministers like sheep 'î will dispense with these commitments.'In May, Steve Baker, former chair of the European Research Group, wrote in The Critic that Cummings 'said we should vote for the original withdrawal agreement without reading it, on the basis Michael Gove articulated: we could change it later'ù. This had indeed been Gove's line since December 2017: 'If the British people dislike the agreement that we have negotiated with the EU, the agreement will allow a future government to diverge.'This idea that Britain could sign the withdrawal agreement with its fingers crossed behind its back and then just ignore it later on is, in a way, perfectly consistent with the larger mentality of Brexit. At the heart of its theology is the fantasy that there is such a thing as absolute national sovereignty, a complete unilateral freedom of action that had been taken away by EU membership. Once Britain is 'unchained'from the EU, Britain can do whatever it damn well pleases. The withdrawal treaty is not a set of permanent obligations, merely a route towards the obligation-free future that starts on 1 January 2021. The Brexiters don't much mind that this trick requires Britain to expose itself openly as a rogue state that treats international agreements as disposable handkerchiefs. In their solipsism, they presumably haven't bothered to look up, for example, the membership of the House ways and means committee that would control any trade deal Britain might make with the US. (To save them the bother, it's chaired by Richard Neal, and includes his fellow Irish-American Democrats Brendan Boyle and Brian Higgins, all highly engaged with Northern Ireland.) The catch is that all of this doesn't stop at smart-arse duplicity towards other countries. It involves the flagrant deception of English voters. More perhaps than any modern election, Johnson's campaign in December was reduced to a single issue and three words: Get Brexit Done. This was to be achieved by electing a parliament that was absolutely committed to passing the 'oven-ready'and 'excellent'withdrawal agreement. There was always one level of spuriousness in this - the withdrawal agreement was not the end of anything. But it is now clear that there was a much deeper and even more cynical level of fakery. It was not just that Brexit would not be 'done'when the withdrawal agreement was duly passed, it was that Cummings and Johnson intended all along to undo it. What was presented to voters as a point of no return was, to them, a temporary arrangement that they would unpick later. 'Oven-ready'had a secret addendum, 'but we'll go back and edit the cookbook to change the ingredients'ù. Brexit is a promise that was made to be broken because the best of all worlds the voters were offered in 2016 was always a mirage. But that breach has grown and widened over time.

Plan for post-Brexit UK internal market bill 'is an abomination',-0.125,Negative,"  The UK government's internal market bill is 'an abomination which would cripple devolution'ù, Nicola Sturgeon has said, escalating already fierce criticism of the proposals from across the devolved administrations. Earlier the Welsh government described Westminster's plans for a post-Brexit UK-wide internal market as 'an attack on democracy and an affront to the people of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland'ù. The Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price, said the bill signified 'the destruction of two decades of devolution'ù, while Scottish Labour's Alex Rowley described it as 'a farce that threatens the very foundations of the United Kingdom'ù. Later in the day David Melding quit the Tory frontbench in the Senedd over the proposals and launched a withering attack on Boris Johnson. Stepping down as shadow counsel general, Melding said: 'The publication of the internal market bill had done nothing to lessen my anxieties about the dangers facing our 313-year-old union and indeed they have been gravely aggravated by the decisions made in the last few days by the prime minister. 'I feel it is necessary to speak out against what I consider to be a lack of statecraft at this crucial time for the UK's very survival as a multi-national state.' The internal market bill, which sets out trading arrangements across the UK after the transition period, also includes clauses which negate key aspects of the EU withdrawal agreement - and which the UK government on Tuesday conceded breaks international law. In a strongly worded statement following the publication of the draft bill at lunchtime, Sturgeon said: 'The UK government are not only set to break international law - it is clear they are now set to break devolution.'Sturgeon pledged that her government would 'fight tooth and nail'against proposals that include a mutual recognition regime, requiring regulatory standards in one part of the UK to be automatically accepted in others, and which she argued would mean 'a race to the bottom when it comes to things like food standards and environmental protections'ù. She said plans would prevent the Holyrood parliament from effectively legislating in a whole range of areas and could, for example, lead to Scotland being forced to accept chlorinated chicken. Jeremy Miles, the Welsh counsel general and minister for European transition, told the Guardian the bill in its current form had 'no prospect'of getting Senedd consent. 'The question is if they don't get that consent whether they will proceed regardless'ù, he said. Describing the proposals as 'an outrageous power grab'ù, he reiterated that the 'cavalier'bill 'seriously imperils the devolution settlement'ù. In an indication of how the devolved administrations are cohering in opposition to the plans, Nichola Mallon, the SDLP deputy and minister for infrastructure, tweeted that she was 'extremely concerned at the actions of the British government'and had discussed attempts to undermine devolved power on infrastructure with Scottish government counterpart Michael Matheson. The Welsh government also accused Westminster of failing to consult them adequately. Miles said: 'We didn't have access to the bill until late last night. Whatever your view about the merits of it, if you're going to put forward a bill which cuts into devolution then plainly anything that is encroaching on devolved territory needs to be discussed and agreed. That has absolutely not happened'ù. There are also profound concerns about a proposed oversight body that would hold any new devolved bills to a 'market impact test'ù, which the Scottish government believes would have jeopardised Scotland-only initiatives such as free university tuition. Sturgeon said: 'Under this bill, the Scottish parliament would not have been able to pass its world-leading legislation on minimum unit pricing of alcohol - a fact which will deeply concern the broad coalition of Scottish civic society which backed this vital public health measure.'The Welsh and Scottish governments wrote to Michael Gove setting out their concerns in July, when the proposals first emerged, warning they would put Scotland and Wales on a collision course with Westminster. Sources at the time reported a more aggressive approach towards devolution from a new generation of Conservative politicians. But Downing Street denied the bill was a 'power grab'ù, insisting there would be no change to the powers already held by the devolved administrations and highlighting that additional powers would be returned post-Brexit in 'at least 70'policy areas. Speaking after prime minister's questions, Johnson's spokesman said: 'What the devolved administrations will enjoy is a power surge when the transition period ends in December. 'There will be no change to the powers that the devolved administrations already have and the vast majority of powers with devolved competencies returning from Brussels will go straight to Holyrood, Stormont and Cardiff Bay.'",-0.25,Negative
Adventures in 'Canzuk': why Brexiters are pinning their hopes on imperial nostalgia,0,Neutral,"In 1962, Dean Acheson delivered a famous address at West Point military academy. The cold war was raging, but the former US secretary of state focused his attention on America's most enduring ally. 'Great Britain,'Acheson told cadets, 'has lost an empire and not yet found a role.'Almost 60 years on, Acheson's words still raise the same question. What is Britain's role in the world? With a no-deal Brexit an increasingly real prospect, a cadre of Conservatives believe they have the answer: the UK must once more take its place at the forefront of the English-speaking world by forming a new relationship with its former imperial territories (well, the majority-white ones, at least). 'The Anglosphere'is not a new idea. Churchill wrote histories of the 'English-speaking peoples'ù. Margaret Thatcher caused a scene at the 1999 Tory party conference when she declared that 'all the problems have come from mainland Europe, and all the solutions have come from the English-speaking nations.'But recently the Anglosphere has had something of a reboot. Tony Abbott - the former Australian prime minister and Britain's controversial new trade adviser - might be sceptical about climate change and homosexuality, but he has long spoken admiringly about a new alliance among the Anglophone world based on mutual recognition of goods and shared geopolitical goals. Abbott is not alone. Writing in the Wall Street Journal last month, the conservative historian Andrew Roberts suggested that the Canzuk nations - Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK - should establish 'some form of federation among them'to 'create a new global superpower and ally of the US, the great anchor of the Anglosphere'ù. Roberts, like Boris Johnson, is a Churchill biographer. The prime minister, too, has often leaned into the Anglosphere. Speaking on a visit to Australia as foreign secretary in 2017, Johnson talked up 'the special genius of the English-speaking people'ù. If this all sounds a bit empire 2.0, well, that's not surprising. Canada, Australia and New Zealand were often referred to as 'the white dominions'in the dog days of British imperialism. Now, with buccaneering Global Britain supposedly setting sail on the post-Brexit high seas, where better to look for friends and allies than in the vestiges of empire? The Anglosphere's resurgence didn't happen by chance. As the authors Michael Kenny and Nick Pearce note in their excellent history of the Anglosphere, the idea's comeback can be traced to a series of transatlantic conferences held around the turn of the millennium. Among the delegates were Thatcher, the future Brexit minister David Davis, the then Daily Telegraph owner, Conrad Black, and prominent conservative commentators such as John O'Sullivan and Francis Fukuyama. But it was Brexit that put wind in the swashbuckling free traders' sails. Daniel Hannan wrote enthusiastic columns in the Daily Telegraph about the coming of a gilded age of the English-speaking nations. (Hannan has now joined Abbott on the board of trade advisers.) A private company was set up to lobby for Canzuk in Britain: Canzuk International has a London address and a Canadian office promoting the alliance. The Anglosphere has long been talked up by influential, anonymously-funded libertarian thinktanks. This week the Adam Smith Institute published a new paper by a pro-Brexit, conservative Australian senator outlining a free trade deal between the UK and Australia that would 'provide the foundation for an ambitious Canzuk agreement'ù. Advocates point to a supposed surge in support for their inchoate plans. More than 90% of Britons believe that the UK should 'form a superpower alliance with Australia, Canada and New Zealand'according to that most scientific of measures, an online poll on the Daily Express website. There is even a quixotic line in Canzuk fan science fiction set in a near-future where carefree office workers shuttle between London and yet-to-be-built cities on the Australian littoral. Back in the real world, the prospects for Canzuk look less rosy. For a start, while British conservatives may dream of a new union of English-speaking people, many of Britain's would-be allies are less convinced. Lewis Holden, chair of the campaign group New Zealand Republic, says there is 'very little for New Zealand out of any Canzuk proposal. Support for the idea might exist, largely due to nostalgia for the British empire, but its benefits are small.'Canzuk does have some advocates across the Commonwealth. Various conservative politicians in Ottawa, Wellington and Canberra have voiced their support. But what exactly they are in support of remains remarkably nebulous. Would Britain allow tariff-free access for, say, Australian beef to UK markets, potentially decimating British farmers? Many in Canada, New Zealand and Australia would like to see stronger ties with Britain - particularly more visas for their citizens - but there is little apparent appetite for the kind of Thatcherite union envisaged by Roberts and others. Writing in the Guardian last year, the former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd dismissed the idea as 'utter bollocks'ù. And then there is the question of race. Canzuk's proponents maintain that it's not a 'white man's club'ù, citing the nations' shared English language and legal system, with the Queen as head of state. Jamaica and Papua New Guinea are omitted due to, eh, insufficient 'development'ù. An imperial fantasy nurtured by a tiny elite, the Anglosphere and its Canzuk cousin are the opposite of what Brexit was sold as. As the writer Aris Roussinos points out: 'that these wild dreams are even entertained by MPs of the governing party only highlights the irreconcilable tensions within the Brexit vote.'With a free-trade agreement with the US receding into the distance and the possibility of a no-deal Brexit rising, Britain is still searching for a role in the world. It's unlikely to find it in racially tinged visions of imperial glory - but don't expect the Anglosphere dream to die just yet.

The days could be numbered for Boris Johnson's Trump tribute act,0.625,Positive,"As on many subjects, Boris Johnson sounds different when talking to different audiences about Donald Trump. In 2015, as London mayor, he accused the then Republican candidate of 'quite stupefying ignorance'ù, for saying that the city was blighted by Islamist-controlled 'no-go areas'ù. Trump was 'frankly unfit to hold the office of president of the United States'ù. Two years later, as foreign secretary, Johnson's position had evolved somewhat. He told the US ambassador that President Trump was doing 'fantastic stuff'and 'making America great again'ù. In a meeting of British business leaders in July 2018, Johnson recognised that Trump showed signs of madness, but admired the method in it. He pondered how effective the approach might be if applied to Brexit: 'There'd be all sorts of breakdowns, all sorts of chaos '¶ But actually you might get somewhere.'That influence is now on display in the proposals to renege on parts of last year's Brexit withdrawal agreement, which by the government's own admission involve breaches of international law. Some ministers revel in the image of Britain flinging shreds of a deal they never loved into European faces. Others, though, still care about the country's reputation as a law-abiding member of the treaty-honouring community. The threat to that status triggered the resignation of Jonathan Jones, the most senior official in the government's legal department. The full extent of Johnson's appetite for Trumpian chaos is hard to know because he believes many opposing things at the same time and is congenitally indecisive. Inside City Hall, he had a reputation for agreeing with people who gave contradictory advice in successive meetings. The trick was to be the last person in the room with him before a decision had to be taken. Some of the fiercest battles inside No 10 are for that privileged position. Johnson admires the effectiveness of Trump's mania, but copies it in spasms, lacking the temperament to emulate it full-time. People who have known the Tory leader for years insist that the persona he adopted to win elections as mayor of London - the metropolitan liberal at ease in the multicultural capital - is closer to his true identity than the chest-beating populist who trawls for votes with Nigel Farage. That may be so, but there is no electoral bridge back to the London-friendly version of 'Boris'ù. That guy would have been a remainer. The government's majority was won by his hardline Brexiteer incarnation. The legacy of Farage is instructive when it comes to the relationship with Trump. In both cases, the issue is as much stylistic as ideological. Conservatives were jealous of support that the former Ukip leader kept poaching from them. Mostly they wanted the same destination - total separation from the EU. But they didn't want to have to sound like Farage, or keep the company he kept, in order to get there. A man such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, for example, does not wish to be seen as a common nationalist, but something more high-minded: a sovereigntist. He likes the votes that Farage's methods bring in, but he wants them delivered to the tradesman's entrance. Johnson's liberal friends claim he was uncomfortable with some of the anti-immigration rhetoric deployed by leavers in the referendum. Not too uncomfortable, though. He rode Farage's tiger all the way to No 10. Vanity and snobbery prevent him from acknowledging the debt. Likewise, Downing Street is coy about praise from Trump, who hails Johnson as a fellow traveller and sees Brexit as the twin project to his own presidency. The cultural affinity is strong enough. As campaigns they mined similar grievances, probed parallel divisions. In government they have a common ethos of ripping up rules, ignoring constitutions and burning old alliances. But to Tory eyes the Trump model is vulgar: too brash, too American. Britain prefers its nationalism dressed in genteel hypocrisy. There is also a practical problem in Britain's proximity to the rest of Europe. No amount of Brexit hot air can inflate the UK into a free-floating continent, equal in stature to the US or China. In terms of economy, population and geography, our strategic peers are France and Germany. The alliance we had with our neighbours, embedded in a dominant trio within the EU, had the effect of enhancing Britain's global power. When the US president does something outlandish, his office exerts the gravitational field of US power. The rest of the world has to bend. That is not true of Downing Street. Johnson is still at the stage of quitting his European band and dreaming of a glittering solo career. But the international scene is a tough gig for a bumbling English Trump tribute act. And the bottom falls out of that market if the original Trump fails to get re-elected in November. President Joe Biden would be in the business of restoring the US's credentials as a responsible actor on the global stage. He would discontinue the current White House policy of spite towards the EU. His victory would signal a recovery for the grownup way of doing things, leaving Britain isolated as the only democracy practising tantrum diplomacy. Johnson would be forced to moderate his temper. The opposite pertains if Trump defies current polling and wins a second term. A lesson that Downing Street would take from such a comeback is that doubling down on incendiary rhetoric works; that the limit of decency defined by constitutional lawyers is a laughable fiction; that the anguished cries of liberals herald success; that elections are won through perpetual culture-war provocation. Any doubts Johnson might have about that approach would be discarded as casually as every other scruple he claims to have known. It is a truism of American elections that the rest of the world has a stake but not a vote. This time, the stakes are highest for Britain. The ballot cannot effect regime change in Westminster, but it can confirm or spoil the calculations on which that regime operates. The personality of the next US president will dictate the direction of the UK government and the character of the prime minister.

Irish MEP in line for EU finance role vacated due to lockdown scandal,0,Neutral,"The veteran MEP Mairead McGuinness has been proposed as Ireland's new EU commissioner, replacing Phil Hogan, who was forced to resign after breaching coronavirus lockdown rules. McGuinness, a European parliament vice-president, would take on the portfolio of financial services, giving her a key role in overseeing access for the City of London to EU markets. Her appointment - which has to be approved by the European parliament - is a better-than-expected result for Dublin, which lost the prestigious trade commissioner portfolio, when Hogan stood down. Ireland had expected to be relatively sidelined with a more modest job after Hogan's departure forced an unwanted reshuffle on the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, only nine months into a five-year term. Valdis Dombrovskis, one of the commission's most senior vice-presidents, has been proposed as EU trade commissioner, which would put him in the driving seat for concluding trade talks with Australia and New Zealand, as well as often tempestuous trade relations with the US. While trade talks with the UK are being led by the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, the EU trade commissioner could come to the fore in any future UK-EU trade dispute. EU leaders have not decided whether to retain a special negotiator for UK-EU relations when the Brexit transition period ends at the end of the year. The two commissioner candidates now face confirmation hearings in the European parliament, but neither is expected to encounter any problems. Both hail from the largest group in the European parliament, the centre-right European People's party. Dombrovskis, a former prime minister of Latvia, is a two-term commissioner and former MEP. McGuinness, an MEP since 2004, is one of the parliament's most senior leaders. She chaired the parliamentary plenary during the last-ever session with British MEPs. On that occasion, she reproached Nigel Farage and his fellow Brexit party MEPs for waving union jacks in the chamber - a breach of parliamentary procedure. She has also taken a keen interest in Brexit talks: during the height of the gridlock at Westminster in early 2019, she urged Theresa May to appeal to moderates with a softer Brexit. Announcing her candidacy, Von der Leyen said McGuinness had 'significant political experience on EU issues'that would be crucial in carrying forward the EU financial sector policy agenda. If confirmed, the EU executive will have a record 13 female commissioners, including Von der Leyen, and 14 men. EU commissioners are not meant to represent their governments, but McGuinness will be an important pair of eyes and ears for Dublin in Brussels. More importantly, if confirmed, she will determine whether banks, brokers, insurers in the City of London can access EU markets, via a series of 'equivalence decisions'ù. The EU's 'equivalence'rules allow firms from non EU-countries, such as Switzerland and Singapore, to operate in EU financial markets, provided they respect regulatory standards to protect against risky behaviour and instability. If a country diverges from EU standards, their access to European markets can be quickly withdrawn. In 2019, Brussels cancelled equivalence for the Swiss stock exchange following the breakdown of talks on a trade deal. The commission is assessing whether to grant equivalence to firms in the City of London, a separate process to the troubled trade talks that got under way in London on Tuesday. A June deadline for equivalence decision was missed, fuelling British fears that the EU is using the process as leverage in trade talks. Dombrovskis, who oversees EU financial regulation, told the Financial Times last month the UK might have to wait until the end of the year to find out whether it qualified for some EU-access rights, because the bloc's own rules are changing.

"Higher education in the UK is morally bankrupt. I'm taking my family and my research millions, and I'm off",0,Neutral,"As academics in England prepare for their strange new semester, I have been making the most of the familiar countryside of the idyllic North Downs in Kent. This summer, the picnics and the walks have been bittersweet: after more than 25 years in the UK, I am leaving to take up a professorship at Hamburg University in Germany. Why am I am going back to the country of my birth? England no longer feels like home. Instead, since the Brexit vote of 2016, I have felt like a 'leaver'in a waiting hall. Now I am going, and the emotional cost will take a long time to come to terms with.  I was from Germany, but I no longer feel I am from there. My seven-year-old son was born in England. His first language is English - he is English through and through. He loves fish and chips; he knows all the players in the England football team (although he's quite a fan of Wales as well). Now we are going to Germany, and it's life-changing and daunting for us all.  We've decided to go because England seems characterised - not unlike the 1930s - by an impassioned anti-intellectualism that seeks simple answers and negates context and complexity. Now a wave of redundancies is snaking its way through the education sector. While the country is in the grip of a pandemic, and with no vaccine in sight, vice-chancellors have sleepless nights - one would hope - over how to keep their outdated business model afloat. The problem cannot be fixed unless politicians and university leaders recognise that the commodification and commercialisation of knowledge is fundamentally flawed. Knowledge needs to be free. Bildung macht frei - education sets you free - was the motto of 19th century German social democrats to forge a more egalitarian, classless society. People, they argued, should not be judged by their wealth or class, but by merit alone. A university sector such as the one we have now, dependent on those who can afford to pay, is doomed. It cannot attract the best. Young people are told they are 'consumers'in a shop where they can choose what and when to learn. They can expect a 'service.' Some have taken their university to court if their course did not 'deliver'promised results. This is no longer a viable, decent learning environment in which students from all walks of life and cultures are supported to achieve their potential. This is not a place in which the next generation of citizens can flourish. The rise in the number of students suffering from mental health issue speaks volumes. A student suicide is 'managed'by the media department for fear of bad publicity. What matters are 'bums on seat'to keep the ship afloat. Britain's cherished higher education sector, once the envy of the world, is on the brink of collapse. The humanities were world leading - and still are in many areas. Scholars in English literature, creative writing, the arts, languages, history and philosophy were acclaimed across the globe. But now the sector as a whole is bankrupt, not just financially, but morally. It has lost its integrity and seems unwilling to engage in critical reflection about the causes of this unprecedented malaise. Likewise, research is taking a massive hit in post-Brexit, post-pandemic Britain. There is good evidence that the exodus of more than 10,000 scholars from Britain's universities since the referendum continues unabated. Scotland has lost almost 2,500 academics. Countries such as Germany are beneficiaries of this mass migration of intellectual talent. Scholars and their families are voting with their feet. Britain is experiencing a significant 'brain drain'ù. Life is too short to wait until the country has come to its senses is what most Europeans - and many British academics - think. Berlin, Hamburg, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Munich, Paris, Amsterdam, Vienna and all the other major European cities have not been idle. They know this is a historic opportunity to attract some of the best minds in the world. At least one other German professorship has recently been awarded to a senior academic from Britain. I know scholars from around the UK who admit that the only reason for them to apply for grants is to increase their chances of leaving this sceptred isle. The loss will be counted not only in intellectual and cultural capital, but in financial terms as well. Hundreds of millions of pounds will no longer be spent in Britain, but in the capitals of Europe. Thousands of post-docs and doctoral students will no longer flock to British universities to study with experts in their field but move instead to where they can find the best intellectual climate, the best infrastructure and career prospects. Britain's attractiveness is waning. In 2018, we marched with 700,000 for a People's Vote. We printed our own shirts with graphics from Axel Scheffler's Gruffalo. One said: 'There is no such thing as a Brussalo'ù. Not everyone got the joke. It was my son's first demonstration and we combined the trip with a lesson about democracy - and a bit of history too. It gave us hope that all was not lost, that things might turn out all right. But the ship has sailed. The people (apparently) decided in a referendum to turn their back on Europe and there was no need to ask them again - it was a once-in-a-generation decision. Students and others who had not got up that day to vote later wondered if they should have. They lamented that they had been robbed. On the day we learned that my wife's British citizenship application had been successful, my son broke down in tears. For months he had worried that his mother would be 'deported'after ministers - Theresa May, Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd, Brandon Lewis - said that EU citizens could be made to leave. The Brexit decision fundamentally changed our outlook on Britain as an open, welcoming society. It changed our sense of belonging. Trust, that invisible bond that links us to other people, had been broken. Where does all this leave me and my family? I was awarded a £10m collaborative grant from the European Research Council to study the European 'common good'with partners in Berlin, Sofia and Budapest. My share of the grant comes with me. The offer from a German university with a higher salary was attractive; the infrastructure and support on offer will be outstanding. So I guess my family and I will be fine. But the sense of loss has been inexplicably sad for me and for my British friends. Emotionally, there are huge question marks in our lives. Why did all this have to happen? Perhaps we will never have an answer. For me, it has been a British love affair. I look forward to coming back - one day, perhaps. But now it is time to go.

Matt Hancock goes haywire taking a spin with Ferrari,-0.25,Negative,"It came billed as the first in a series of Call the Cabinet with Nick Ferrari on LBC radio. But just how many weeks it will last is anyone's guess as most ministers can barely be trusted to complete a coherent sentence let alone go head to head with one of the sharpest presenters on radio. Thirty minutes with Gavin Williamson or Priti Patel? I just can't see anyone in Downing Street imagining that would be a good idea. First up, though, was Matt Hancock. Of course it was. Matt isn't just about the closest thing No 10 has to a safe pair of hands apart from Rishi Sunak (and there was no way the chancellor was going to appear; Boris would veto him on the grounds he might be too good) and he is also pathologically hot-wired to be unable to refuse. Put a microphone in front of Tigger, his natural enthusiasm gets the better of him and he just can't say no. Even after all the beatings he has taken over the past few months. Last week, Hancock had broken with tradition by turning up for an interview in a brand new powder-blue tie, but for LBC he had reverted to his tired and trusted lucky pink number. Just as well as Ferrari immediately had the health secretary on the back foot by pointing out that the UK had just registered its highest number of coronavirus cases for months. Poor Matt was torn between wanting to play down the situation - most of the ill were from the younger demographic - and stick to the government's preferred message that it was about time people started to go back to work to buy some sandwiches from Pret a Manger and acknowledging that it was indeed a bit of a worry as the same thing had happened in France and Spain a couple of weeks ago and their rates of hospital admission were now increasing rapidly. In the end, Tigger did what Tigger so often does. He hedged his bets. 'Have you lost control?'Yeah but no but yeah but no. Ferrari then went to his first caller, a Francis from Twickenham who had been shielding and was worried about his daughter going back to school. 'How old is your daughter?'Hancock asked. 'Fourteen,'said Francis. Tigger visibly relaxed. There was little risk from 14-year-olds as it was mainly the 17 to 21-year-olds who weren't obeying the social distancing guidelines, he said. Francis didn't seem wholly convinced Hancock had understood that not only might his daughter bump into the odd 17-year-old at school or on public transport and might catch the virus that way but that she might pass it on to him. But he had to make do with assurances that everything would probably be OK. Then came the Brexit question that Hancock had been dreading. Terry from Birmingham worked for a medical devices company and wanted to be certain that the recent 'no deal'noises coming out of Downing Street weren't going to have a detrimental effect both on his job and on the nation's health. 'Well, the good news, Terry, is that we have a deal already,'said Matt, 'and so, even if we have no further deal, we made an agreement for the actual exit from the EU at the end of January this year.'Um ... yes. Except it's a deal that Boris Johnson now appears to be keen on unilaterally ripping up. And binning the Northern Ireland protocol in the process. It turned out that when the prime minister had been caught on camera telling a Northern Ireland trade delegation that they could just throw away any customs declarations that came their way he wasn't joking after all. It was actually government policy. Under Boris, any international treaty the UK had signed could be binned whenever it became an inconvenience. Which didn't exactly fill anyone with confidence that he could be trusted on any future free trade agreements. But this was all way above Matt's pay grade. He started stammering, repeating himself and generally lapsing into total incoherence. There was still a good chance of the UK signing a Canada-style deal - something that had taken the EU the best part of seven years - from a standing start in the next month or so, providing the rest of the EU were stupid enough to take us at our word. But if we couldn't pull this off, then we had a fully prepared alternative in an Australian deal. As in no deal at all. Though with any luck we wouldn't notice just how bad that would be as the economy would be tanking from the coronavirus crisis anyway. After questions on care homes and the travel industry that Tigger was also unable to answer sensibly, Nick from Nottingham called to ask how come the world-beating track and trace had advised him to go to Dundee as his nearest coronavirus testing centre. Er ... Scotland was lovely at this time of year and the adviser had obviously thought that the 700-mile round journey might cheer him up a bit. But if Nick didn't fancy that Matt would try to guarantee that no one had to go more than 150 miles there and back to get a test. And taking the train wouldn't be a problem as most were barely 25% full. The interview ended in pantomime. Literally, with Hancock all but promising a vaccine in the next two months and a full season of Christmas fun. Oh no it won't, Ferrari muttered. 'Oh yes it will,'said Hancock, not entirely convincingly. 'Cheer up,'said his special adviser on the way out. 'At least you weren't eviscerated by Nick Robinson on the Today programme like George Eustice. Poor old Useless was left trying to explain how a 40% tariff on agricultural products would be a good outcome in a no-deal Brexit. Not even you could have talked your way optimistically out of that.'",-0.25,Negative
"Reneging on Brexit deal would strengthen case for breaking up UK, government told",-0.5,Negative,"Reneging on any obligations under the Brexit withdrawal agreement would make the case for breaking up the UK stronger, the government has been warned, as a minister defended the plan as simply addressing 'a few minor loose ends'ù. After it emerged Boris Johnson is drawing up legislation that will override the Brexit withdrawal agreement on Northern Ireland, threatening the collapse of talks with the EU, the SNP said leaving without a deal would cause 'lasting damage to Scottish jobs and the economy in the middle of a pandemic'ù. Ian Blackford, the SNP's leader, said 'By threatening to undermine the UK's international treaty obligations and impose a catastrophic no-deal Brexit on Scotland against our will, the prime minister is proving he cannot be trusted and is underlining the need for Scotland to become an independent country.'Johnson is to put an ultimatum to negotiators this week, saying the UK and Europe must agree a post-Brexit trade deal by 15 October or Britain will walk away for good. Ahead of his comments, the Financial Times reported that the UK could row back parts of the UK's agreement with the EU on state aid and customs arrangements for Northern Ireland. It is understood the UK government believes the original protocol is drafted ambiguously enough to allow for a change of interpretation, something likely to be bitterly disputed in Brussels. A UK government source told the Guardian the plan was part of the preparation for a no-deal exit that would present a number of new barriers to trade from Northern Ireland. Asked about the proposals, the environment secretary, George Eustice, said such a move would merely tackle 'a few minor loose ends'ù, adding: 'We're not moving the goalposts.'The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain's entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a 'deep-seated hostility'towards the European project. With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home. The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted ""yes"". Margaret Thatcher, later to be leader of the Conservative party, campaigned to remain. Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the ""iron lady"" marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand 'our own money back'claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back'despite being one of the 'three poorer'members of the community. It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.† Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in 'embryo'ù. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU. Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was 'òno, no, no' to what she saw as Delors' continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch's Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered 'Up yours Delors'front page. A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of 'a single market without barriers - visible or invisible - giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world's wealthiest and most prosperous people"". Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.† Tony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers' rights. Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels.

Eustice confirmed that any changes to the withdrawal agreement, hailed by Johnson before December's general election as forming an 'oven-ready'deal with the EU, would be connected to trade between businesses in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. He told Sky News that while it was accepted that 'some checks on some goods'would be needed, for example for agri-foods, some areas were not pinned down by the withdrawal agreement. 'The point about all this is, there's been this conundrum about the negotiations on leaving the European Union around how we handle that very special relationship with Ireland,'he said. 'The news this morning can exaggerate certain things. The point is that the Northern Ireland protocol is agreed, we're working with that in good faith. But it was always recognised there were a few minor technical issues that still needed to be resolved through a joint committee process. Where there are legal ambiguities at the end of that, on things like exit declarations and things like that, we need to provide businesses with the certainty they need.'However, the idea of the UK government seeking to rewrite an international agreement it signed up to only months ago is likely to be seen in a very different light by others. Labour said the prime minister was 'threatening to renege on the UK's legal obligations'and called it 'an act of immense bad faith: one that would be viewed dimly by future trading partners and allies around the world'ù. The news was condemned by Ireland's foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, who helped broker the original Brexit settlement. He said any change would be 'very unwise'ù. On Monday, the prime minister will set a firm deadline of 15 October - the date of the European council - for a deal to be signed, with the mood bleak as formal talks resume this week between the UK's lead negotiator, David Frost, and the EU's Michel Barnier. If no agreement is reached before the deadline, the UK will 'move on'and accept that a deal cannot be struck, Johnson will say, adding that no deal would be a 'good outcome'ù. The prime minister will strike a belligerent tone, suggesting there will be no movement from the deadline and claiming the UK is ready to trade on World Trade Organization terms from January. 'There is no sense in thinking about timelines that go beyond that point,'he will say. 'If we can't agree by then, then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on.'Johnson and his allies have repeatedly said they did not believe earlier negotiations made the threat of no deal tangible enough. EU officials had previously said the deadline would be the end of October. Sources close to the talks have suggested fresh faces and interventions by member states are now needed to break the impasse after days of recriminations. ",-0.125,Negative
UK businesses demand urgent talks over fears of Brexit border chaos,-0.25,Negative,"Businesses trading with the EU are demanding an urgent meeting with government ministers over concerns there are significant gaps in the UK's Brexit border preparations. Eight logistics organisations have written to say they fear the supply chain that keeps supermarket shelves stocked daily will be severely disrupted next year if issues are not resolved before Brexit. They have expressed concern that some of the IT systems have not yet been tested and with four months to go there is not enough time to educate and train companies in the new systems, fuelling concerns of Brexit border chaos in January. 'If these issues are not addressed '¶ UK business and the supply chain that we all rely so heavily on will be severely disrupted,'said a letter to the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, from the Road Haulage Association, Logistics UK, UK Warehousing Association and others. Logistics UK, which represents freight owners, says companies that currently trade seamlessly with the EU are being asked to deal with eight different IT systems to trade with the biggest partners in the bloc. The group are demanding a roundtable meeting with Gove, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps. Four of the IT systems are being rolled out by UK authorities, but hauliers are then faced with four other systems when they arrive in France, Belgium, the Netherlands or Ireland. One new IT system, known as the 'Smart Freight'traffic light system, is designed to ensure drivers who do not have the correct paperwork for export to the EU will be barred from going into Kent and therefore adding to congestion on local roads and the port of Dover. They have been told they face fines of £300 if they drive into Kent without the right documentation for international transit. Logistics UK says the system will not go into beta phase testing until the autumn. 'We are concerned that mass user testing of the software will not be possible until October - or maybe even November. This is far too late for the thousands of companies and tens of thousands of people who build our complex supply chains to redesign their own processes and contractual relations,'said Sarah Laouadi, the European policy manager at Logistics UK. Delays in rolling out the IT system have fuelled fears of congestion and chaos, with queues developing in lorry parks in Kent and new sites set to be commandeered for holding lorries across the country. 'There is nothing the lorry driver can do, if the paperwork is wrong, the paperwork is wrong and the truck will have to stay where it is until the paperwork is right, which could mean hours or even days in a lorry park,'said another source at Logistics UK. According to a Cabinet Office memo, seen by Bloomberg, the government is aware of the potential dangers and mentions two further IT systems on top of the eight the logistics sector is aware of. 'There are up to 10 new systems that haulage firms and freight forwarders will have to navigate from Jan 1, including at least three being designed now,'the memo said. 'This is completely unnecessary and unmanageable with duplication and overlap.'Shapps said he would meet haulage bosses. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday he had 'very, very regular contact'with 'people like the Road Haulage Association'ù. A government spokesperson said they had received the letter and would respond, adding the border operating model published earlier this summer detailed its approach. 'We worked closely with industry in its development and will continue to do so as we move towards the end of the transition period. 'In addition to the border operating model, we are also investing £705m in jobs, infrastructure and technology at the border and have announced a new £50m support package to boost the capacity of the customs intermediary sector ensuring we are ready for the changes and opportunities ahead,'the spokesperson said.

Brexit: EU rejects UK proposal for reuniting child asylum seekers,-0.5,Negative,"The EU has rejected a British proposal for a system to reunite children seeking asylum with their families in the UK or Europe, prompting warnings that more young people will risk their lives in dangerous Channel crossings. The government had proposed a post-Brexit agreement to continue transfers of unaccompanied child asylum seekers to families living in either the UK or EU, although with no obligation on either side. An EU official said the bloc's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, would not take this forward as part of current talks due to end in late October because 'this is not in the EU mandate'ù. The EU's 27 governments agreed Barnier's negotiating mandate in February but set out only vague aspirations for 'cooperation'and 'dialogue'on dealing with people fleeing war, repression and poverty. EU states have shown little appetite to rewrite Barnier's mandate on child asylum seekers, because they perceive the British plan as offering little. 'It doesn't bring much added value, we suspect it's more about sending people back,'said a second EU official, who added that any way forward was likely to be via bilateral agreements between the UK and individual EU states. The EU rejected a broader migration pact, including adults, for similar reasons. Beth Gardiner-Smith, the chief executive of Safe Passage, said the absence of any agreement would be 'pretty catastrophic'for the child refugees her NGO supports. 'These are unaccompanied children in Greece, in France, in other parts of Europe who have family in the UK and a legal right to unite with those family members.'She fears many will feel they have no choice but to undertake dangerous Channel crossings or other risky journeys. 'Without safe and legal routes to join their loved ones, to reunite with family, they are more likely to seek alternative routes and they are often dangerous routes and exploitative routes.'In 2019, 312 children requested asylum in the UK through family reunion under the EU's Dublin regulation. Safe Passage argues that relying on international asylum law is no substitute for a formal transfer system on family reunion. 'We would urge the UK government - if this is it - they absolutely need to bring forward primary legislation to protect the rights of these unaccompanied children because otherwise, unfortunately, we will just see more children risking their lives,'Gardiner-Smith said. In particular NGOs are calling on the government to back an amendment to the immigration bill from the Labour peer Lord Dubs that would enshrine in UK law the right to family reunion for asylum seekers, as it exists under EU law. A Home Office spokesperson did not respond to questions about the EU decision not to pursue the British proposal on child reunion, or whether it would seek bilateral deals, but instead highlighted the government's criticisms of EU migration rules. 'The government's efforts to facilitate entirely legitimate and legal returns of people who have entered the UK through illegal routes are too often frustrated by rigid EU returns regulations and last-minute challenges submitted hours before a scheduled flight. These claims are very often baseless and entirely without merit, but are given full legal consideration, leading to removal being rescheduled.'The topic of family reunion for children is not on the agenda of any upcoming negotiation rounds, including the next starting in London on Monday. Neither do EU negotiators plan to discuss a separate British proposal to return asylum seekers to the European country they arrived in. 'Member states have taken note and decided not to engage based on the UK proposal,'said the first EU source. Countries including Italy and Greece, the arrival points for large numbers of refugees and migrants, had opposed any deal with the UK before the EU changes its migration policy. Later this month the EU executive is expected to propose a long-awaited overhaul of EU asylum law, but agreement will be fraught with difficulties. After 1.1 million refugees and migrants arrived in Europe in 2015, officials proposed a change intended to ease the pressure on frontline Mediterranean states. Deadlock among member states meant the proposals were shelved. Citing the EU's impending overhaul, an EU political source said: 'I would be very surprised if in this context the EU applies the Dublin system to the UK, a third state.'",-0.5,Negative
Michel Barnier 'worried and disappointed' over Brexit talks impasse,-1.875,Negative,"The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said he is 'worried and disappointed'over the UK's approach to the talks, fuelling fears that the UK will leave the bloc in January without a deal. He said there was no breakthrough at a meeting on Tuesday with the UK's negotiator, David Frost. 'We didn't see any change in the position of the UK, which is why I expressed publicly what I say, that I am worried and I am disappointed because, frankly speaking, we have moved, [and] shown in many issues real openness in the past months,'Barnier told the Institute of International and European Affairs in Dublin. He said the EU had recognised the UK's red lines on fair competition, fisheries and governance, including the European court of justice, and was willing to compromise, but the UK was refusing to put proposals on the table on state aid or fisheries. 'On all these issues, the UK sides continue to disappoint,'he said.  Talks about 11 subject areas that will determine post-Brexit trade and the UK's future relationship with the EU have been going on since March. Last week EU insiders described the talks as a 'whole summer completely wasted'ù. Barnier said he was more a realist than an optimist and was convinced Boris Johnson would not allow the UK to crash out. 'I continue to think, despite the current difficulties, that Boris Johnson wants an agreement with the EU,'he said. But he added more than once that this would not be at any cost. 'The EU will not sacrifice its principles for the sole benefit of the UK.'He said the UK wanted a zero tariff and zero quota trade deal, but 'they will have to move'to achieve that as the EU would not strike a deal that would be to the 'detriment of the EU and the single market'ù. Barnier said sometimes he heard people in the UK talking about no deal and he thought: good luck. 'There will be a huge difference between a deal and a no deal. I still think, even if it is very difficult, that a deal is possible.'He said the UK's insistence that it simply wanted a deal like Canada or Japan was not based on reality. The proximity of the UK made it different to other trading partners as it automatically brought higher volumes and breadth of commerce. 'This shows clearly why we need these economic and commercial fair play and critical mechanisms to avoid trade distortions and unfair competitive advantages,'he said. 'This is particularly important in the state aid, where the potential to distort competition using subsidies is clearly significant.'Barnier warned that the UK and the EU faced serious Brexit consequences on 1 January, the end of the transition period, deal or no deal, with customs declarations, health checks and friction for banks and car manufacturers. Johnson's spokesman said Frost and Barnier had a 'useful review'of the agenda for next week but 'major difficulties remain'ù.  He said 'the EU's insistence on progress on state aid and fisheries is an obstacle to making progress overall'ù. ",-2.75,Negative
No 10 blames EU and plays down prospects of Brexit trade deal,-0.5,Negative,"Downing Street has played down the prospect of reaching a trade deal with the EU in time for December, saying it will be 'very difficult'- and blaming Brussels' insistence on tackling tough issues upfront. The UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, is meeting his EU counterpart Michel Barnier in London, in advance of the next round of formal talks next week. But with the clock ticking to 31 December, when the status quo transition is due to end, Boris Johnson's official spokesman conceded that hopes of a deal were dwindling. 'The EU continues to insist that we must agree on difficult areas in the negotiations, such as EU state aid, before any further work can be done in any other area of the negotiations, including on legal texts, and that makes it very difficult to make progress,'the spokesman said. 'We would instead like to settle the simplest issues first, in order to build momentum in the talks, as time is short for both sides.'The EU has consistently said it wants to see the contentious issues of fisheries policy and state aid settled up front. EU officials are exasperated however by the briefings about negotiations in London, pointing out that the UK has not yet tabled its own proposals for state aid. 'How can we negotiate this when we don't even know what state aid in the UK will look like next year,'said a source. Insiders say the UK is trying to 'cherry pick'and claiming it would be happy with a 'bare bones'deal, while making sizeable asks across the 11 sections of the negotiations which, when put together, amount to a deal of substance.  Johnson's government is reluctant to cede any control over state aid policy, boasting during last year's election campaign that one benefit of Brexit would be that the government could intervene more readily to help struggling UK businesses. The prime minister's spokesman underlined that message on Tuesday, saying: 'We'll set out further detail of our domestic regime in due course. After the transition period, the UK will have its own regime of subsidy control, and will not be subject to the EU's state aid regime. We have been very clear about that throughout.'He added: 'The UK's future subsidy arrangements are a matter for the British people and parliament, not the European Union.'Brussels regards state aid constraints as a key aspect of ensuring a level playing field, so that UK businesses cannot unfairly undercut their EU counterparts. With an EU council expected to be held in October to finalise any free trade agreement, time is running short. During last year's fraught negotiations over the EU withdrawal agreement formalising the UK's exit terms, Johnson made significant last-minute concessions - effectively allowing a border in the Irish Sea - to get his 'oven-ready'deal done. But he is under pressure from Brexit-backing Conservative MPs not to make fresh compromises now - and even to repudiate some aspects of the withdrawal agreement. One potential solution to the negotiating impasse that has previously been mooted is a series of separate deals on different issues - financial services, fisheries and so on. But a senior UK official close to talks has previously revealed that the EU is not keen on a 'Switzerland-style suite of agreements'ù, in reference to the 100-plus bilateral deals the country has with Brussels, as it 'would be too complicated to manage for them'ù. The EU is also keen to have an overarching deal on governance and dispute resolution. France's EU affairs minister, ClÈment Beaune, said that no deal was a risk, but blamed the British government for the impasse. 'Things are not advancing because the UK would like to have its cake and eat it: to leave the European Union and have access to the European market,'he said. Speaking on French radio, he said the EU would not compromise on linking market access to respect for its rules on health and the environment. The EU has said the UK can only have tariff-free, quota-free access to the European market if it agrees to respect European standards on environment, workers' rights and state aid for companies. EU officials dismissed reports Barnier was refusing to discuss British proposals on a future fisheries treaty. 'The UK has not presented new legal texts in the area of fisheries,'a spokesman for Barnier said. 'We have been engaging constructively and in good faith. Michel Barnier said at the end of the last round of negotiations that we have shown flexibility by taking note of prime minister Johnson's three red lines and working on them. We have not seen, however, a reciprocal effort on the UK's side regarding European priorities. We are now waiting for the UK to present concrete and constructive proposals.'",-0.125,Negative
What are Conservative backbenchers' main grievances?,0.75,Positive,"Boris Johnson is expected to face criticism from Tory backbenchers as MPs return to Westminster with lists of grievances - from the government's multiple U-turns, to planning reform and the forthcoming budget. Here's what restive MPs have on their minds. From lockdown hawks to mask-sceptics, a huge number of Conservative backbenchers have privately and publicly expressed concern at the sheer number of U-turns over the summer recess, usually begun with a categorical denial that the government's position will shift, followed by unilateral change or a change in Scotland or Wales, and finally an about-turn. From the A-level grading chaos, to the enforcing of face-covering in shops and certain schools, Johnson's No 10 operation is seen to be days behind the curve. Key critics: Charles Walker, deputy chair of the 1922 Committee, Bernard Jenkin, chair of the liaison committee. This is a thorny issue for many Tory MPs, a significant number who have always wanted to see the back of the 0.7% spending target will see the pandemic as an opportune moment to cut back on this spending, but others feel equally as strongly about the moral case for aid and as a tool of soft power. Downing Street has denied the aid budget, now subsumed into the Foreign Office with the demise of the Department for International Development, is a target for savings but rightwing papers have briefed that it could be used to plug holes in defence spending - though that would require primary legislation. Key critics: Former development secretary Andrew Mitchell, former cabinet minister and the chair of the One Nation Tory caucus, Damian Greene. The reforms, which will give default planning permission in areas earmarked for development, are likely to result in a significant rise in housebuilding in Tory shires, leading some MPs to call for the government to reprioritise building on brownfield sites. Affluent, leafy suburbs, typically Tory, are likely to be the top targets for building because the reforms require councils with the least affordable housing to release the most land. The Tory MP Neil O'Brien was the first to publicly criticise the reforms and Conservative-run councils are extremely wary of the reform, which requires them to relinquish most of their planning powers. Key critics: MP Neil O'Brien, a former No 10 aide, and multiple Conservative council leaders. Rishi Sunak has some difficult choices ahead in the budget about how to claw back rivers of cash spent coping with the coronavirus pandemic. He has been reportedly eyeing potential increases to corporation tax, cheered by the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, but which has caused horror at the Institute of Directors, which has warned it 'risks stamping out the recovery'ù. The Sun suggests a rise in fuel duty - but this is often a move mooted ahead of budgets then quashed as a sweetener to Tory backbenchers. An increase in capital gains tax is also likely to be opposed by Tory MPs, criticised as a hit to middle income-earners. Key critics: Robert Halfon, chair of the education select committee and anti-fuel duty campaigner and Conservative-aligned business groups. Opponents of a no-deal Brexit still do exist in parliament, including former cabinet minister Greg Clark and former ministers Steve Brine and Stephen Hammond, but most have been muted since the December election result. Pressure to shun any deal from the EU is likely to come from Brexiters who have already made noises of discontent about the withdrawal agreement signed by the prime minister before the UK's exit in January, particularly over the UK's financial liabilities. In July, a report by the Centre for Brexit Policy, endorsed by Bill Cash and Owen Paterson, demanded the junking of the withdrawal agreement, which it called a 'poison pill'ù. Key critics: Former cabinet ministers Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson. ",0.5,Positive
The Guardian view on the end of recess: an autumn of discontent looms,0.125,Positive,"In a cringeworthy social media stunt before the last election, Boris Johnson mimicked the famous cue-card sequence in the film Love Actually, itself a parody of Bob Dylan's Subterranean Homesick Blues video. The prime minister's scrawled series of messages conveyed the ultimately winning trope of 'get Brexit done'ù. As parliament returns on Tuesday, and the nation braces for what is likely to be an autumn of considerable discontent, words from another Dylan classic, My Back Pages, seem to sum up Mr Johnson's current situation: 'My existence led by confusion boats, mutiny from stern to bow.'The now notorious sequence of Covid-related U-turns performed by the government reflects a chronic lack of planning and foresight. Failing to reconcile the twin priorities of safeguarding public health and protecting the economy, ministers have vacillated, prevaricated and lurched first in one direction and then the other. As the days begin to shorten, the sky is turning dark with chickens coming home to roost. This week, the chair of the 1922 committee of backbenchers, Sir Graham Brady, is expected to represent its concerns to the prime minister after a chaotic summer in which Sir Keir Starmer's Labour party has wiped out a 26-point Tory lead in the polls. MPs' morale, says the committee's vice-chair, Charles Walker, has been badly eroded. Given the government's track record, and the challenges the country faces between now and Christmas, it is unlikely to improve. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, enjoyed a honeymoon period after swiftly introducing the job retention scheme in March, and has scored a popular success with his 'eat out to help out'subsidy to restaurants, pubs and cafes. But the chancellor's determination to shut down the scheme at the end of October is likely to trigger a huge rise in unemployment. Around one in eight employees are still furloughed and Mr Sunak's cut-off point is looking brutally premature. As he deals with a steeper recession than in the 1980s and a deficit expected to rise to £300bn by the end of the year, the chancellor must somehow find the money in an autumn budget in November to boost growth, and keep the Treasury finances in order. The hostile response from Tory MPs to reports of possible tax rises is an early shot across Mr Sunak's bows on that front. Amid fears of a coming second wave of Covid-19, the drive to encourage more people back to workplaces has so far been a failure, undermined by a justified lack of public confidence in the government and the emergence of new lifestyle patterns. According to an AA poll, a majority of managers and professionals continue to work from home. Meanwhile, weekend reports suggest that the reopening of universities in October is likely to be as fraught and complicated a process as getting pupils back to school. Yet again, the government stands accused of failing to perform due diligence in its preparations, particularly in relation to the testing of students travelling to and from campuses. Once the raison d'etre of Mr Johnson's administration, Brexit has become a millstone around the nation's neck, as the government foolishly sticks to its timetable for leaving the single market and customs union on 31 December. Whether or not a deal is struck with Brussels, an entirely unnecessary proliferation of red tape will create costly headaches for businesses attempting to cope with the end of the furlough scheme, a steep recession and possible local lockdowns as a result of a resurgence of Covid-19. There are not, then, many reasons to be cheerful, as this blundering government takes the country into autumn and winter. In the best of times, Mr Johnson's essential unseriousness would have exposed the country to unforced errors and strategic recklessness. In Covid times, he and his government are a national liability. It will be a rocky ride to Christmas. ",0.5,Positive
Fresh controversy over Tony Abbott's Brexit trade role,-0.125,Negative,"Tony Abbott, the former Australian prime minister, boasted that he signed deals with China because he was not 'sidetracked by peripheral issues such as labour and environmental standards'ù, raising further questions over the UK government's reported intention to use him as a trade envoy. Abbott will reportedly be appointed to the Board of Trade, which advises Boris Johnson and trade secretary, Liz Truss, on future trade deals and will be a vital component of the UK's future post-Brexit trade strategy. Abbot's past accounts of his role in Australia's trade deals with China, Korea and Japan, signed during his two-year premiership, suggests he would have little sympathy with government's stated intentions to maintain British standards on food, the environment and workers' rights. In a column for the Spectator Australia in March 2017, Abbott said he had made three contributions as prime minister to getting the deals done: setting a deadline, ensuring focus from the top, and endeavouring 'to ensure that we weren't side-tracked by peripheral issues such as labour and environmental standards'ù. He added: 'Our insight was to grasp that free trade deals are too important to leave to the officials.'During the Brexit campaign and since he became prime minister, Boris Johnson has insisted that workers' rights and environmental standards would be maintained once Britain leaves the single market and customs union. However, the government has repeatedly avoided attempts to guarantee those rights with legislation. It removed a section of the EU withdrawal bill that referred to workers' rights, claiming they would be covered by a new employment bill. A bill was introduced last year but has yet to progress to a second reading. It has also avoided attempts to include a 'non-regression'clause to prevent the government from weakening environmental standards. Rules on the use of antibiotics in British farm animals have already been weakened after hundreds of restricted medicines were left out of regulations due to come into force in January. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says a new list would be published in 2021. Next month, the House of Lords is expected to vote on amendments to the agriculture bill, which seek to enshrine in law the Conservatives' manifesto commitment not to reduce environmental or food standards as part of its post-Brexit trade strategy. Green groups are concerned that news of Abbott's appointment is part of a pattern. Shaun Spiers, chair of the Greener UK coalition, said: 'Tony Abbott would be a perfect choice to advise the government on how to undermine environment, animal welfare and food standards. But if the government really is serious about not compromising these standards in trade negotiations, appointing him is bizarre.'David Lawrence from the Trade Justice Movement said: 'Hiring Tony Abbott to one of the top jobs in UK trade policy is a baffling choice. 'The government claims it wants Britain to be a world leader on tackling the environmental crisis, but in order to achieve this our trade policy - and trade appointments - need to be radically overhauled.'Australian and British politicians have reacted with incredulity to reports of the appointment, which has not been confirmed, although Truss said Abbott had done 'excellent work'on trade in the past. Critics say Abbott had little to do with Australia's trade deals. He is sceptical about the climate crisis and in 2014 as prime minister he attempted to delist 74,000 hectares of World Heritage-protected forest in Tasmania. His party ousted him as leader after two years and he lost his Sydney parliamentary seat in 2019 to an independent candidate who campaigned on the environment. ",-0.25,Negative
The Guardian view on Brexit deadlines: Boris Johnson's nemesis,0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson's government is too often caught unawares by events that were not only predictable but scheduled. The start of a new school term has been a feature of autumns for a lot longer than Gavin Williamson has been education secretary, yet arrangements for keeping classrooms safe from Covid-19 are still uncertain. Ministers cannot answer a question as simple as whether masks should be worn. As with the mess over exam results, guidance issued one day is contradicted the next. The pattern is set by the prime minister. He deals in grand ambitions, not plans for their realisation. When things go wrong he shifts the blame, as he did on Wednesday when he suggested a 'mutant algorithm'ù, and not ministerial incompetence, was at fault over the grading fiasco. The top civil servant at the education department is being ousted; the secretary of state responsible is not. The problem is most extreme in relation to Brexit. Every stage of the UK's uncoupling from the EU has been mapped out by treaty, including the expiry of transitional arrangements at the end of this year. By then, a free trade deal is supposed to have been negotiated and ratified. That is getting harder with each passing week. The impediment is British reluctance to recognise what is realistically available, or understand the imbalances of power in negotiations between a lone country and a continental trading bloc. In June, the prime minister said he could see no reason why broad agreement might not be reached in July. But there was a reason, and he was it. Mr Johnson has not paid close attention, made choices or given his negotiators bandwidth for compromise. The UK still demands pristine sovereignty, with no obligation to align its standards with EU markets, plus a right to subsidise domestic industries to a degree not permitted under Brussels rules. The EU will not grant privileged market access on those terms, because doing so would undermine its own industries. Eurosceptic hardliners say they would prefer no deal to any obligation to match continental standards. Whether that is a bluff or not is a question that interests EU leaders less and less. They have other things to do. At the instigation of Germany, Brexit has been dropped from the agenda of a top-level European meeting next week on the grounds that there is nothing new to discuss. Mr Johnson knows what the options are - they range from close integration to something more distant, with tariffs and quotas - and he must choose. But he doesn't. Instead, the government still treats Brexit in the most superficial manner, as if the performance of readiness counts as the real thing. A report that Tony Abbott, a former Australian prime minister, might take on a senior trade advisory role is a case in point. Setting aside Mr Abbott's notoriously rebarbative character, the appointment would be consistent with the myth, common among Brexit supporters, that trade deals are conjured into being by swaggering personalities. The reality is that good outcomes in a trade deal are achieved by the application of time, attention to detail, experienced negotiators and a rational appraisal of the other side's interests. The UK government is deficient on all those metrics. As with the challenge of reopening schools, or grading exams never sat, the job does not get any easier with neglect. Leaving everything to the last minute, testing the fixity of deadlines, is a method that might have worked for Mr Johnson when he was a newspaper columnist, but it is no way to run a government. He operates one day at a time, stumbling from one problem to the next, with no sense of a strategic horizon. Such a man cannot safely settle the UK's long-term relations with its neighbours. Nor, for that matter, should he be trusted with many other tasks required of a prime minister. ",0,Neutral
Germany scraps plans for Brexit talks at EU ambassadors summit,0.25,Positive,"Germany has scrapped plans to discuss Brexit at a high-level diplomatic meeting next week because there has not been 'any tangible progress'in talks, the Guardian has learned, as Brussels laments a 'completely wasted'summer. EU officials now believe the UK government is prepared to risk a no-deal exit when the transition period comes to an end on 31 December, and will try to pin the blame on Brussels if talks fail. The German government, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU council, had intended to discuss Brexit during a meeting of EU ambassadors on 2 September but has now dropped the issue. 'Since there hasn't been any tangible progress in EU-UK negotiations, the Brexit item was taken off the agenda,'an EU diplomat said. The decision matters because Angela Merkel was billed as a potential dealmaker when talks on the UK-EU future relationship reach a crucial stage this autumn. The German chancellor last week met Emmanuel Macron at the French president's official residence on the French Riviera, where they discussed the EU's post-Brexit future. Following last week's inconclusive round of negotiations, both governments issued near-identical statements calling for 'concrete answers'from the British government. 'Over the recent months Franco-German cooperation has gained new traction,'said the EU diplomat, with the two countries having 'realigned'on issues including Brexit. 'Given this new reality it would be futile to wait for a white knight from Paris or Berlin to come to the rescue.'Sandro Gozi, an Italian MEP who sits in Macron's party in the European parliament and was Italy's Europe minister during the early phase of Brexit talks, said: 'I doubt even Merkel or Macron would be able to transform a stalemate into a positive outcome. 'I have always thought - that is my personal position - that no-deal was a real option especially on London's side '¶ Every day that passes without concrete progress is a day closer to no-deal Brexit.'Dropping Brexit from next week's diplomatic agenda is a sign of deepening pessimism in Brussels. 'People underestimate how bleak the mood is in the EU negotiation team,'said an EU official who added that time was running out to negotiate a complex legal treaty expected to exceed 400 pages. 'We have had the whole summer completely wasted, a cabinet that doesn't understand how the negotiations work, a prime minister who, I think, doesn't understand how the negotiations work - because he is under the wrong impression that he can pull off negotiating at the 11th hour.'The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, last week declared he was surprised by the UK 'wasting valuable time'as Boris Johnson had told EU leaders in June that he wanted an outline deal by July. The EU official said: 'If they (the UK government) see it's not going to work out they are just going to try and make it really acrimonious.'A UK document leaked to the Sun on Sunday, warning of public disorder, shortages and price hikes in the event of a no-deal Brexit, was perceived in Brussels as a sign of the government's seriousness about leaving the EU single market and customs union with no agreement. 'More and more people have come to the conclusion that Brexit ideology trumps Brexit pragmatism in the UK government,'the diplomat said. 'If the UK really wanted to jump off the Brexit cliff for ideological reasons, there would be no way for the EU to stop this.'If the UK's negotiating stance became 'more pragmatic and realistic'ù, there was still a chance to save the talks, they added. For the EU, 'pragmatism'means accepting that tariff-free access to the single market necessitates common standards on environment, state aid, worker and consumer protection - a position rejected by the UK. With talks set to resume on 7 September, EU sources are increasingly frustrated with the UK chief negotiator, David Frost. 'The feeling is that David Frost acts more as a UK messenger then a UK negotiator. If he doesn't get more negotiating space, talks will remain in dire straits,'said the EU diplomat. British officials hit back, accusing the EU of slowing progress by insisting that all difficult issues had to be resolved in parallel. 'The EU's insistence that nothing can now progress until we have accepted EU positions on fisheries and state aid policy is a recipe for holding up the whole negotiation at a moment when time is short for both sides,'said a UK source close to negotiations. 'We are also faced with the EU's frustrating insistence on parallelism, meaning that they will not progress areas apart from these 'òdifficult' ones until we have moved towards their position on them. That's a sure way to hold up the negotiations. For our part we are ready to knuckle down and get into the detailed discussions of legal texts which is what is needed now. We hope the EU will do likewise.'Johnson is understood to have full confidence in Frost and the UK negotiating team. ",0.375,Positive
Littering epidemic in England as government spends just £2k promoting Countryside Code,0.25,Positive,"An unprecedented rise in litter, damaging fires and 'fly-camping'across the English countryside is partly a result of the government spending less than £2,000 a year over the past decade on promoting the Countryside Code, campaigners say. The code, a set of simple guidelines to help rural visitors respect wildlife, local people and landscapes, was relaunched in England in 2004 after the new 'right to roam'law increased access to the countryside. But after a brief flurry of advertising devised by the makers of Wallace and Gromit, successive governments since 2010 spent just £2,000 every 18 months reprinting the code for distribution until recent months. In comparison, the government spent £46m on last year's 'Get ready for Brexit'campaign. A survey of visitors to the Lake District this summer found that while 70% had stocked up on alcohol for the trip and 25% were bringing barbecues, only 13% said they were aware before their visit that they should follow the Countryside Code. Twenty per cent were visiting the area for the first time. Rural landowners have reported unprecedented problems as millions holiday in the UK during the coronavirus pandemic. There has been widespread littering, numerous dry heathlands catching fire because of disposable barbecues, and many incidents of dogs worrying livestock and wildlife. Guy Shrubsole, the author of Who Owns England?, who uncovered the figures, said: 'Access to nature is vital for everyone's mental and physical health, and it's brilliant to see more people visiting the countryside this year - the vast majority of whom treat it with respect. But the government shares some responsibility for the awful recent instances of littering and vandalism through their consistent failure to promote the Countryside Code. 'In other European countries, greater freedom to access nature comes hand-in-hand with a culture of 'òleave no trace'. The government ought to be fostering that here, by extending our existing right to roam alongside a properly funded public information campaign on responsible access.'Shrubsole and the author Nick Hayes are leading a new right-to-roam campaign to extend the Countryside and Rights of Way (Crow) Act in England so that millions more people can have easy access to open space. In 2004, the Labour government spent £721,000 on promoting the code with a campaign using characters created by Aardman animations. But since an in-house refresh by Natural England in 2010-12, the only expenditure until after lockdown was to reprint the code every 18 months at a cost of £2,000. Scotland has a different Outdoor Access Code, while Wales promotes its own Countryside Code similar to England's. As lockdown was eased, the government produced a Covid-19 version of the code stressing the need for social distancing and giving way on narrow footpaths, as well as the traditional advice about taking litter home and not lighting fires. During July and August the government ran a 'Respect the Outdoors'campaign with messages on bus shelters, Snapchat, Google and Bing. Natural England has also developed Countryside Code messages with social publisher LadBible that were shared with their 37 million Facebook followers, and social media videos promoting responsible behaviour in the countryside. The fate of a future refresh by Natural England will be decided by the current spending review. A Defra spokesperson said: 'The Countryside Code is there to protect people, property and habitats - and we urge people to follow the guidance and respect the communities and environment that make up this iconic part of our country. 'We are committed to ensuring the code remains comprehensive and up to date, which is why it was recently revised to respond to issues raised during lockdown - and we launched our 'òRespect the Outdoors' campaign which urges visitors to respect the code and our wonderful countryside.'Jeff Knott, the RSPB's director for central England, said: 'Across the country we are seeing people rediscovering nature and wanting to explore the countryside. The end of lockdown and good weather has inspired large numbers of people to visit their local nature reserve and learn more about the UK's wildlife. This is great news - overwhelmingly people are interested and respectful. However, for many this is a new experience. 'The Countryside Code is a practical set of guidelines about how we can all enjoy our natural world without harming it. We would welcome any move to help promote the code to more people so we can all continue to enjoy our countryside and the wildlife we share it with today, tomorrow and in the future.'",0.125,Positive
Time for real debate on river regulation,0,Neutral,"Your article (Environment Agency chief supports plan to weaken river pollution rules, 19 August) is wrong to say that I 'endorsed a proposal to water down laws on cleanliness of polluted rivers, lakes and coastlines after Brexit'ù. What I said was that the water framework directive was 'a candidate for thoughtful reform to deliver even better outcomes'ù. This was as part of a speech titled In Praise of Red Tape: Getting Regulation Right - which can be read online at gov.uk - in which I said we should have a debate about which bits of inherited EU environmental law we should keep or change; and that the test should be whether changing the law 'will allow us to regulate better and achieve higher environmental standards'ù. I also said regulation is essential to protect the environment; that it works, which is why many of our rivers are cleaner than at any time since the Industrial Revolution; that it needs teeth, including in tackling water companies which pollute our waters; and that it should aim to enhance the environment, not just protect it.

Environment Agency chief supports plan to weaken river pollution rules,0,Neutral,"The head of the Environment Agency has endorsed a proposal to weaken laws on cleanliness of polluted rivers, lakes and coastlines after Brexit. Campaigners say Sir James Bevan is trying to 'rig the system'to cover up decades of failure by the agency. Bevan flagged the idea of amending the EU's water framework directive (WFD) to an audience of business leaders. England has consistently failed to bring its rivers up to the standard required under the directive, which puts waterways through four stringent tests designed to assess their health. Rivers have to be assessed on all four tests in order to be graded as 'good'- known as the one-out-all-out rule. Just 14% of English rivers have been assessed under the directive as good. The directive sees water quality as an area that can have the most significant impact on the environment and examines factors such as biology, physical character, depth, width, flow and pollution as part of the four tests. But Bevan said in his speech that he wanted England to reform the directive to end the one-out-all-out rule and allow rivers to be judged on one criterion rather than all four. If that changed, the number of rivers judged in a good state would rise dramatically overnight. Bevan acknowledged the directive was landmark, and sets high standards demanding deadlines for improving water quality in rivers, lakes, estuaries and groundwater. He said: 'It has driven much of the work that the EA and others have done over the last 20 years to secure those improvements.'Nevertheless, it is 'a candidate for thoughtful reform'in a post-Brexit UK, he said. Bevan said the one-out-all-out rule 'can underplay where rivers are in a good state, or where improvements have been made, to those that aren't. Right now only 14% of rivers in England qualify for good status under the WFD, because most of them fail on one or other of the criteria. But many of those rivers are actually in a much better state than that, because most of them now meet most of the criteria: across England, 79% of the individual WFD indicators are at good status.'The one-out-all-out rule could also force regulators to focus time and resources on indicators that might not make much difference to actual water quality, Bevan said, and some rivers in urban settings would never achieve all criteria because they could not be restored to their natural state. Campaigners reacted angrily to the signal that the leader of England's main environmental watchdog was supporting what they said was a watering down of the key measure to clean up rivers and coastal waters. Hugo Tagholm, of Surfers Against Sewage, who used the framework directive to help drive a cleanup of UK coastal waters, said: 'Engineering the testing programme to give the illusion that our rivers are in a healthier state than they currently are won't help us accelerate the much needed restoration of our aquatic and coastal environments. 'Sewage, farming effluent and urban runoff plague and destroy riverine ecosystems nationwide and we need radical thinking and interventions to practically restore and rewild this blue ecosystem for wildlife and for people.'The Guardian revealed last month that water companies released 1.5m hours of raw sewage via storm outflows into rivers in 2019, in 204,000 discharges all of which are permitted by Bevan's agency. Critics say the agency is giving water companies a licence to pollute, and exploiting the rules that say sewage can only be released in exceptional circumstances, like extreme rainfall. Feargal Sharkey, the former lead singer of the Undertones, who now campaigns to save rivers from overabstraction and pollution, condemned any suggestion of a weakening of the protections currently in place. He said: 'The whole idea is a charade, nothing more than the worst kind of clumsy pretence aimed at trying to cover up decades worth of the EA's own failure and incompetence.'The Environment Agency declined to comment specifically, but pointed to the text of Bevan's speech. '¢ This article was amended on 19 August 2020. Sir James Bevan's comments applied only to England, not to the UK as referred to in a previous version. The article also used 'criteria'when 'criterion'was meant. ",0,Neutral
Sir Paul Nurse: 'The UK has taken a leap several decades into the past',-0.5,Negative,"Sir Paul Nurse is a geneticist who won the Nobel prize in 2001 for his work on the cell cycle. He is director of the Francis Crick Institute and was head of Cancer Research UK. He has also been president of the Royal Society. What Is Life? is his first book and it seeks to explain biology in five steps. Your book is a reminder of the fundamental importance of cells. Do you think cells have been overshadowed by genes in the public imagination?I'm a geneticist, so I've lived through molecular genetics and molecular biology and that has focused a lot on genes. I do think cells have not caught the attention of the world in perhaps the way they should have done, because it's the fundamental unit of life. I sometimes use this analogy: it's like biology's atom. It's not the gene, it's the cell. During the Covid-19 crisis, you've been critical of ministers and advisers, comparing them to blancmange. Do you think we need to rethink that relationship between politicians and advisers?Yes, I do. I'm particularly concerned about the attempt to convey communication through one-liners such as 'we're following the science'ù. It's a sort of populist tendency and that reduces complex situations to an almost meaningless sentence. I also think we need more clarity about how decisions are made. For example, testing for coronavirus was absolutely critical. What they decided to do was produce very big labs to do it, not thinking that this would take many months to get it to work efficiently. Whereas they could have developed it locally and contributed something immediately. All the testing capacity basically did nothing during the big infection phase. That was very bad policy and implemented badly, but we didn't see the discussions behind those decisions. Another area of concern for you is the effect of Brexit on the science community. Do you see any cause for optimism there?Not really. There are three major science blocs in the world, which are North America, China and the far east, and Europe. Britain is actually good at science and had a lot of influence in European science. And so we have lost power and influence. That's a political thing. The psychological thing is that I meet scientific colleagues around the world and they just think that the UK has turned away from collaborative science by looking back on an imperial history that no longer exists. It's just very sentimental. And we've taken a leap several decades into the past. You mention an extraordinary personal story in the book: that you found out that your sister was actually your mother. How has it affected your sense of identity?I was in my late 50s when I found out. I was living in New York and I was president of a research university called Rockefeller University. I applied for a green card and was turned down, which was a bit of a surprise because I had a Nobel prize, I was president of a university and I was knighted. It was because they didn't like my birth certificate, which didn't name my parents. So I applied for a full birth certificate and discovered the truth. I'm astonished that my parents, who were my grandparents, managed to keep this all quiet. As my actual mother and grandparents were dead, I had no recourse to find out exactly what happened. I would like to know who my father is. I mean, I'm a geneticist. I'm actually quite a good geneticist. And I lived for half a century not knowing my own genetics. I hope I find out before I eventually die. Your main area of research is in yeast, but you became head of Cancer Research UK. How far away do you think science is from gaining some cellular grip on cancer?Our understanding of cancer has really dramatically improved. We understand the cellular basis of it, the genetic origins of it, the ways in which it's caused, the way in which the regulatory circuits get altered in cancer cell tissue, which is immensely complicated and one reason it's so difficult to develop therapies. Our treatment of it is still lagging but in my view we will be able to get cancer under significantly more control in a matter of decades, though we'll never be able to eliminate it. You famously failed your French O-level six times. What are your linguistic skills like these days?They are absolutely appallingly bad. It's a matter of great distress to me because I travel a great deal. I even got a LÈgion d'honneur, believe it or not. I had to give the speech in French! You needed a foreign language to get into university, so they let me sit French six times. I didn't pass so I worked as a technician for a year. And then eventually I was let into Birmingham University. What did it mean to you to win the Nobel prize?The Nobel prize is the prize that everybody knows. I was fortunate that I got it on the 100th anniversary of the Nobel, so it was a great occasion. The fact is that I do talk more to the public and journalists now and it's mainly because of the Nobel prize. Suddenly you become a public figure. You have to be careful you don't say anything too stupid. In some countries such as India or China it's a huge distinction, even in Germany and France. In the UK, we don't tend to see it like that so much. In some ways, I think that's a good thing. What Is Life? by Sir Paul Nurse is published on 3 September by David Fickling Books (£9.99).

Labour says government's treatment of asylum seekers lacks 'compassion',-1.375,Negative,"The UK Government's handling of the rising numbers of people crossing the Channel in small boats is 'lacking in competence and compassion'ù, the shadow home secretary has said, as pressure mounts on ministers to offer safe and legal routes for asylum seekers. Nick Thomas-Symonds said the attempt to 'militarise a response to a humanitarian crisis was shameful'in a letter to the home secretary, Priti Patel, after she requested support from the Ministry of Defence. He demanded to see any legal advice that informed the controversial move. A £340m RAF Poseidon P8 aircraft - principally intended to track the movements of Russian submarines - buzzed over the Channel on Wednesday to help Border Force patrol boats spot migrants. It was the second time the armed forces have launched a plane over the Channel this week. Thomas-Symonds intervention came after major humanitarian groups and charities warned there would be an increase in crossings if the UK government does not strike an adequate family reunion deal before the Brexit transition period ends. EU legislation known as the Dublin regulation determines the member state responsible for handling an asylum application, with family unity being a primary consideration. Since 2015, 3,079 people have been transferred to the UK under the Dublin regulation, including 714 transfers in 2019, to be reunited with their families as they claim asylum. When the transition period ends on 31 December, so will the UK's obligations under the Dublin regulation. Safe Passage International, which helps unaccompanied child refugees access Dublin family reunions, said the closure of this route would force more children into lorries and dinghies. Jennine Walker, head of UK Legal at Safe Passage International, said: 'The government says it wants to reduce the numbers of people crossing the Channel, but if children and separated families cannot access family reunion, they are going to have no choice but risk their lives. 'It is disgraceful that the government is closing a legal route that has protected people from smugglers and traffickers by giving them a safe way to reach their relatives and start rebuilding their lives. Unless the government agrees a family reunion replacement that is at least as good as Dublin, smugglers and trafficking gangs will have a field day when the transition period ends.'The number of crossings in small boats this year is already more than double the total in 2019. The crossings have been met with a hardline approach from the government, which has pledged to work with France to make the route unviable. Ministers have said a 'comprehensive plan'is being worked on 'at pace'ù, but little detail has been offered. Earlier this week, the MoD provided an A400M Atlas transport to fly over the Channel at heights of less than 1000 feet, although officials denied its purpose was intimidatory, saying it was intended to help correctly identify blips on the radar. But there still no sign of Royal Navy ships coming to work alongside Border Force at sea. MoD officials said that talks with the Home Office were ongoing over whether to provide additional naval capability. Thomas-Symonds said: 'The approach being pursued by the Government is lacking in competence and compassion, resulting in thousands of people, including many children, risking their lives in incredibly dangerous waters.'In May the government published a draft Brexit proposal to replace family reunion, but lawyers have described the text as a 'blank cheque to people smugglers'ù. In June a cross-party group of MPs tried to table an amendment to an immigration bill to protect family reunion rules, but the government voted it down. Campaigners hope the government will be defeated when the bill returns to the Lords with Alf Dubs leading efforts to rally peers in support of family reunion with a fresh amendment. Lord Dubs, a former child refugee whose tireless campaigning led to the introduction of the Dubs scheme, which facilitated the transfer of unaccompanied children to the UK, said: 'We must not forget that children trying to reach the UK have fled war and persecution and tragically many continue to experience unimaginable dangers one they reach Europe. 'The government's draft Brexit text is completely inadequate and there are no guarantees the EU will even agree a family reunion deal.' Laura Padoan, a spokesperson for UNHCR said: 'After the Brexit transition period, we hope that mechanisms will be in place to allow refugees in Europe with family in the UK to transfer here safely and legally. But more also needs to be done to make the immigration rules in the UK less restrictive and burdensome so that refugees can reunite more easily with their family members who aren't in Europe.'Vickie Hawkins, executive director at MÈdecins Sans Fronti√®res UK, said: 'It is deeply hypocritical for the government to attack people for using unsafe routes to the UK, while simultaneously shutting down the few safe, legal routes for seeking sanctuary which exist.'A Home Office spokesperson said: 'We have made a generous offer to the EU on a future reciprocal arrangement for the family reunion of unaccompanied children seeking asylum (UASC) where it is in the child's best interests. 'No one should risk their lives by making these dangerous crossings. The UK does more to support unaccompanied children than any EU member state, and last year our asylum applications from unaccompanied children accounted for approximately 20% of all UASC claims made in the EU.'",-1,Negative
The Guardian view on Brexit bureaucracy: tied up in red tape,-0.125,Negative,"The government did not quite achieve the Brexit breakthrough it was seeking on Friday, when there was hope that a fast-tracked trade agreement with Japan might be reached. But it seems likely that a deal, essentially replicating one signed by the EU and Japan last year, will be done by the end of the month. Some kind of morale booster for Britain's battered and bruised businesses would certainly be welcome. As the clock runs down to the end of the transition period on 31 December, ministers are no longer bothering to offer the false hope of a relatively frictionless trade agreement with the EU. Even a Canada-style free trade deal will mean a vast infrastructure of compliance and checks: permits for lorry drivers to enter Kent, huge customs clearance centres and tracking apps are all in the mix. The government estimates that, from 2021, there will be over 400m extra customs checks a year on goods going to and from the EU. As the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has acknowledged, re-litigating Brexit is a pointless exercise. But given the immediate context, the folly of not extending the transition period becomes more apparent with each passing week. The country is heading deep into recession and a possible winter resurgence of Covid-19. The explosion of new bureaucracy and red tape will compound the misery for businesses and add to their costs. From the pharmaceutical industry to the freight trade, alarm bells are now ringing loudly in companies being tested beyond their limits. The government's continuing insouciance is breathtaking. Last week, the Department of Health airily advised medical suppliers to stockpile six weeks' worth of drugs to cope with possible disruption at the end of the transition period. The effects of the pandemic on existing stocks and global supply chains make this a near-impossible task. The imposition of new customs and border controls will further destabilise supply chains. About 70% of prescription medicines in the UK come to Britain via the EU. The December departure date coincides with what is generally the busiest time of year for the pharmaceutical industry, even in a normal year. This year, the spectre of a flu outbreak combined with a Covid-19 surge looms. The deputy chair of the British Medical Association has described the situation as 'incredibly concerning'ù. The government's new border operating plans, unveiled last month by Michael Gove, were criticised by freight operators for lacking detail and relying on as-yet untested technology. Much will depend on the successful functioning of 'track and trace'style technology to obviate the need for long queues and checks at borders. The 'smart freight'system is not expected to be ready for testing before November, ahead of a January launch. The failure of the contact-tracing app tested on the Isle of Wight does not inspire confidence. The prospect of fines for drivers who are not 'border-ready'when entering Kent suggests that ministers will not hesitate to blame businesses when things start to go wrong. Given the pressures that employers and employees alike have been under since March, this would be wholly unfair. As one senior figure in the pharmaceutical industry put it recently, there is a desperate need for 'a bit of breathing space'as companies face an unprecedented set of variables and unknowns. But even at a time of national crisis, the theological demands of Brexit continue to trump all practical considerations. It is an irresponsible and reckless way to govern a country.

Brexit: UK government pledges £355m to cushion Northern Ireland businesses,0,Neutral,"The UK government has announced a £355m package to cushion Northern Ireland businesses from the costs of trading with the rest of the UK because of Brexit. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said on Friday £200m would be spent on a trader support service (TSS) to help firms handle new bureaucracy to move goods across the Irish Sea, turning the government into a de facto customs agent for traders. A further £155m will be spent on digital technology to streamline processes required by the new internal border created by the Northern Irish protocol, part of the Brexit deal that aligns the region to the UK customs territory and the EU customs code. It means all businesses sending goods to the region from Great Britain will have to make formal declarations for the first time. First details of the new trading conditions across the Irish Sea emerged  last month, with businesses obliged to complete customs, security and transit forms on all goods being transported to Northern Ireland. Boris Johnson, the prime minister, was accused of misleading the public about the Brexit deal last November after footage emerged of him telling exporters in Northern Ireland they would not need to fill in extra paperwork. Downing Street continues to insist Northern Ireland will have unfettered access to markets in Great Britain. The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain's entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a 'deep-seated hostility'towards the European project. With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home. The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted ""yes"". Margaret Thatcher, later to be leader of the Conservative party, campaigned to remain. Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the ""iron lady"" marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand 'our own money back'claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back'despite being one of the 'three poorer'members of the community. It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.† Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in 'embryo'ù. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU. Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was 'òno, no, no' to what she saw as Delors' continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch's Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered 'Up yours Delors'front page. A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of 'a single market without barriers - visible or invisible - giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world's wealthiest and most prosperous people"". Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.† Tony Blair patches up the relationship.

David Cameron returns from Brussels with an EU reform package - but it isn't enough to appease the Eurosceptic wing of his own party The UK votes to leave the European Union, triggering David Cameron's resignation and paving the way for Theresa May to become prime minister After years of parliamentary impasse during Theresa May's attempt to get a deal agreed, the UK leaves the EU. Gove, who is to visit Belfast on Friday, will also announce £300m in funding for the Peace Plus programme, which promotes peace, prosperity and reconciliation on the island of Ireland. 'Today's £650m investment underlines our absolute commitment to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland as we move towards the end of the transition period.'Gove, who as chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is de facto deputy prime minister, added: 'As we continue to engage with businesses, and our discussions with the EU proceed, we will update these resources to ensure that traders are ready for the end of the transition period.'The trader support scheme, which is to start next month, will give free advice to companies and complete import declarations on their behalf, passing the administrative burden to officials and the taxpayer. Business leaders welcomed the supports as significant but said more help would be needed. 'We've consistently said for a long time that the government should help with the cost of transition, because we're facing the biggest change in how we move goods between GB and Northern Ireland in a lifetime and the burden of that shouldn't fall on the shoulders on businesses here,'Seamus Leheny ,of the Freight Transport Association, told the BBC. Aodh√°n Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said the supports would help ease trade frictions but said the timeline was ambitious, details remained unclear and funding would need to be replenished.

Brexit 'òshould prompt UK to rethink attitude to Indigenous artefacts',0,Neutral,"Britain's departure from the EU and the renewed focus on empire should prompt a 'significant shift'in its approach to returning sacred artefacts to Indigenous communities, the head of an Australian government-funded project has said. More than 33,000 items of Indigenous Australian heritage are held in UK museums, including some believed to have been stolen during or shortly after Captain James Cook's first voyage to Australia 250 years ago. Manchester Museum became the first UK institution to return some of these objects in a powerful handover ceremony in November. Yet despite a growing restitution movement, many leading British museums have appeared reluctant to hand over sacred artefacts because of concerns about the wider implications for their collections. Craig Ritchie, who runs what is believed to be one of the world's biggest repatriation projects, said Brexit and the renewed focus on Britain's imperial history represented a powerful moment to reassess the UK's relationship with Indigenous Australians so that it 'isn't just one where we happen to share a monarch and isn't just one where we are interested in trade deals'ù. He said: 'If it's true that Brexit is more than simply getting out of some kind of political union with Europe and is, in fact, an expression of the UK trying to rethink its place in the world independent of Europe, then part of that is the opportunity to rethink and recalibrate the relationship between the UK and its former colonial dominions and '¶ the indigenous people in those former colonies'ù. Ritchie is head of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (Aiatsis), which is funded by the Australian government and has identified more than 100,000 sacred artefacts and cultural material in institutions around the world, of which a third are in the UK. Although Aiatsis hopes to return as many artefacts as it can, Ritchie said: 'Not everything will come home and probably not everything should,'adding that it was willing to explore alternative arrangements with UK institutions. However, he said the final resting place of the objects was 'a decision that should be made by the community of origin rather than just a recalcitrant white institution that's refusing to give stuff back'ù. The Pitt Rivers Museum, which displays the University of Oxford's archaeological and anthropological items, has the biggest collection of this material in the UK with about 16,000 pieces. The museum works with Aiatsis to help understand the material and is known for engaging with indigenous peoples. Cambridge University's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology has the UK's second largest collection of indigenous items, with about 3,000 artefacts, and the British Museum is believed to have about 2,900 in its collection. Ritchie said the institute's discussions with the British Museum, which has previously been reluctant to permanently return relics to Australia, were going to be 'a longer process'and that it would have to 'step our way through what could easily become quite a minefield of politics and tricky questions'ù. The then culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, last year ruled out any change in the law to allow national museums to return objects to their countries of origin. Arts Council England is due to publish updated guidance this year on the repatriation of cultural objects, superseding existing guidance produced by the defunct Museums and Galleries Commission in 2000. Of the 38 UK institutions that responded to an Aiatsis survey two years ago, 17 said they were willing to consider a return request and most said they were happy to share information about their collections. Ritchie said the confluence of events surrounding Brexit, the renewed focus on Britain's colonial legacy, and the successful repatriation by Manchester Museum would herald a significant shift in the approach of many UK institutions.

Germany calls on UK to show more realism in Brexit negotiations,0.125,Positive,"Angela Merkel's government has called for more realism from the UK in the ongoing trade and security talks, after the EU capitals were given a 'sobering'update by Michel Barnier following the recent round of Brexit negotiations. After a presentation by the EU's chief negotiator to ambassadors from the 27 member states on Friday, a spokesman for the German government, which holds the rolling EU presidency, said the bloc was ready to move negotiations quickly forward but 'expressed the need for more realism in London'ù. The comments will be a blow to Downing Street, where it had been hoped the resolution of the EU's internal budget and recovery fund debate would allow Merkel and the other leaders to intervene and unblock the negotiation following a month of little progress. 'With the [budget] now wrapped up we hope member states will become more engaged in this process in Brussels and get them moving forward politically in a helpful way,'a UK source close to the negotiations said. The two sides completed their latest round of negotiations in London on Thursday without being able to agree on the basic outlines of a deal to reassure businesses about the future, which Boris Johnson had said in June should be possible. But despite publicly warning on Thursday that a deal by the end of the year appeared 'unlikely'given the British position on fisheries and Brussels' demands for a 'level playing field'ù, sources said Barnier had not been overly pessimistic in his presentation on Friday. He warned the ambassadors that he believed negotiations needed to be wrapped up by the beginning of October due to the lengthy ratification process. Echoing the language recently used by the UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, Barnier said that even if the deal on offer was 'low quality'ù, as recently claimed by the British official, a 'zero tariff, zero quota'agreement was a prize worth having. He added the EU would be open to revisiting some issues next year to strike separate agreements if the current negotiation was successful. The two main obstacles to a deal remain the access of European fishing fleets to British waters and arrangements to ensure neither side can undercut the other by lowering regulatory standards or unfairly subsidising industry. It is understood a number of the eight member states with the greatest interest in fishing access reiterated to the room of ambassadors that they would not agree to a deal without agreement on fisheries. Last week's talks on fishing access focused on quota-sharing arrangements and the list of stocks for which shares need to be agreed. Barnier claimed the UK was effectively excluding European fleets from key stocks of fish in a move that risked destroying the bloc's fishing industry. The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain's entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a 'deep-seated hostility'towards the European project. With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home. The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted ""yes"". Margaret Thatcher, later to be leader of the Conservative party, campaigned to remain. Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the ""iron lady"" marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand 'our own money back'claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back'despite being one of the 'three poorer'members of the community. It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.† Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in 'embryo'ù. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU. Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was 'òno, no, no' to what she saw as Delors' continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch's Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered 'Up yours Delors'front page. A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of 'a single market without barriers - visible or invisible - giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world's wealthiest and most prosperous people"". Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.† Tony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers' rights. Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. 'Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,'he said in his maiden speech. 'The level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.'Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro. EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club. Anti-immigration hysteria seems to take hold with references to 'cockroches'by Katie Hopkins in the Sun and tabloid headlines such as 'How many more can we take?'and 'Calais crisis: send in the dogs'ù. David Cameron returns from Brussels with an EU reform package - but it isn't enough to appease the Eurosceptic wing of his own party The UK votes to leave the European Union, triggering David Cameron's resignation and paving the way for Theresa May to become prime minister After years of parliamentary impasse during Theresa May's attempt to get a deal agreed, the UK leaves the EU. On level playing field clauses, both sides have agreed there should be a 'non-regression'on labour, the environment and climate standards as they stand at the end of the transition period. The EU is demanding a 'forward-looking'mechanism to ensure there is no regulatory undercutting in the future should the EU further develop its rulebook. There is a deadlock on state aid rules, with Brussels calling for the UK to publish its plans for controlling subsidies once the UK is outside the single market and customs union. Downing Street has so far appeared reluctant to respond to Barnier's pressure, insisting its rulebook is wholly independent from the EU now the country has left the bloc. EU sources said there was concern in Brussels that interest in striking a deal was waning in London but that an agreement in September remained the most likely outcome given the economic damage of failure.

"Brexit trade deal is 'unlikely' by end of the year, says Barnier",-0.625,Negative,"Michel Barnier has said a trade and security deal with Boris Johnson's government by the end of the year appeared 'unlikely'ù, as he complained that Britain was demanding 'near total exclusion'of European fishing boats from its waters. After the latest round of negotiations in London, the EU's chief negotiator told reporters in a virtual press conference that the two sides were 'still far away'from agreement with just three full months to go before a 31 October deadline. Despite signs of compromise in some key issues, including on the need for a single deal rather than multiple sectoral agreements, the EU official said there had been 'no progress'on the two most difficult areas: the rights of European fleets in British waters; and ensuring neither side drives down regulatory standards or is able to unfairly subsidise their businesses. In a statement, the UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, concurred that there were 'considerable gaps'but insisted that an agreement could still be reached in September. UK sources said Barnier's assessment that the talks were 'back at an impasse'accurately described the situation, but added this was for technical reasons that could be surmounted over the summer. The two sides are to meet for two days of informal talks next week before a formal round of negotiations in mid-August. But Johnson's optimistic hopes of agreeing an outline of the principles of a deal by the end of this month had been dashed, Frost conceded. 'It is unfortunately clear that we will not reach in July the 'òearly understanding on the principles underlying any agreement' that was set as an aim,'the UK official said. In his remarks at the end of the week's talks, Barnier had focused on fishing rights and the UK's failure to offer reassurances on its state aid regime from the end of the 2020 as the major obstacles to a deal. 'The UK is effectively asking for near total exclusion of EU fishing vessels from UK waters,'Barnier said. 'That is simply unacceptable.'He said the EU was willing to accept that 'there may be change to the benefit of UK fishermen'but that it would not be at the price of the 'destruction of the EU fishing industry'ù. On state aid, Barnier said the UK had failed to offer any assurances on how it would regulate subsidies once the country was outside the single market and customs union at the end of 2020. 'We need consistency or some sort of equivalence between our respective systems,'he said. 'We need to see what is ahead of us. I understand what David said that the UK is still going through an ongoing debate, parliament and government are still working on this but the debate does still have to make some sort of progress.'Barnier said: 'Over the past few weeks the UK has not shown the same level of engagement and readiness to find solutions respecting the EU fundamental principles and interests.'He added: 'It means simply that by its current refusal to commit to the condition of open and fair competition, and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement at this point unlikely.'In notably more optimistic comments, Frost highlighted the EU's 'pragmatic'acceptance that the European court of justice would not have any jurisdiction in the UK and the British recognition, in turn, of the need for there to be one all-encompassing deal. 'We have heard the EU's concerns about a complex Switzerland-style set of agreements and we are ready to consider simpler structures, provided satisfactory terms can be found for dispute settlement and governance,'he said. Frost conceded, however, that given the difficulties that remained, there was still the risk of a deal not being secured. 'Although we will continue energetically to seek an agreement with the EU, we must face the possibility that one will not be reached, and we must therefore continue preparing for all possible scenarios for the end of the transition period at the end of this year,'he said.

'Not in a position to say': Ian Botham refuses to comment on peerage claims,0.125,Positive,"Ian Botham has refused to comment on speculation he is to be awarded a life peerage as Boris Johnson marks his first year in Downing Street by appearing to reward Brexit supporters. The 64-year-old former England cricketer said he was respecting protocol, meaning he 'cannot say anything at this stage'ù. A report in the Times suggested he would enter the House of Lords after being a high-profile supporter of Brexit. 'You will know the protocol as well as I do,'Botham told the Guardian. 'And that is that I obviously cannot say anything at this stage. That's the way it works.'He said the apparent contravention of the appointments protocol by the Times had 'nothing to do with me'ù, adding: 'The Times can write what they want and people can speculate but I'm not in a position to say anything, and when I am then I'll be free and open with everybody.'Botham is considered one of England's greatest ever cricketers, with 5,200 Test runs and 383 wickets. He was knighted in 2007 in recognition of his charity work and services to the sport. At a Vote Leave event in County Durham with Johnson in May 2016, he said: 'I have been lucky enough to grow up in a wonderful country, a country that has always been able to look after itself.'But he said he believed the UK's power had been 'eroded by Brussels'ù.  He added: 'I think, hang on, enough's enough'and 'it would be nice to go back to being [the UK]'ù. He also said the country could become 'cluttered'if it remained in the EU. Asked about concerns over job losses if the UK voted to leave, Botham said: 'If we stay, who's going to get those jobs? The people coming into our country, they don't seem to have to come over with a job, any qualifications, just turn up.'A keen shooter, Botham has also long criticised conservation groups and claimed grouse shooting promotes stewardship of the environment, despite the burning of heather and the killing of animals who may disturb or kill mating game birds. Reporters received no answer at his home near Richmond, North Yorkshire, on Saturday, where it was understood he held a cook-along charity barbecue the night before. No 10 refused to comment on the report, which also named more than two dozen other possible recipients of life peerages. The list is said to include four ex-Labour MPs including Frank Field and Gisela Stuart, both of whom supported Brexit. There could also be peerages for Ian Austin and John Woodcock, who backed remain but supported Johnson's Brexit deal and urged Labour voters not to support Jeremy Corbyn, according to the Times. The article also suggested Johnson would seek to heal divisions in the Conservative party with peerages for the remain supporters Ken Clarke, Philip Hammond and Ed Vaizey. The trio had the Tory whip withdrawn after seeking to block a no-deal Brexit. The House of Lords appointments commission vets nominees from political parties to the upper parliamentary chamber, and the Queen then bestows peerages. An announcement on peerages is due to be made this month. ",0.25,Positive
Police ability to detain EU suspects 'slower' without Brexit deal,0.5,Positive,"The ability of UK police forces to detain criminal suspects from the EU will become slower and less effective if the government fails to seal a Brexit security deal, a senior officer has told MPs. Richard Martin, a deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police and the lead for Brexit and international criminality, said forces would lose the 'instant, at your fingertips'access to EU-wide databases on criminals and criminal activity that could be the difference between catching a criminal and losing them. 'There are contingencies in place - but what they are is slightly slower, not as quick, or as effective as the ones that we currently have,'Martin told the Brexit select committee. His remarks came a day after the Home Office revealed details of the post-Brexit immigration system, under which deportations of EU nationals with convictions for serious crime will be allowed. However, Martin's evidence to select committee indicated that police capability to identify EU criminals on British soil would be slowed if there is no deal. He told MPs it could take 60 days to get criminal records from European counterparts for suspects in the UK compared with six days currently if police could no longer access European Criminal Record Information System (ECRIS). The committee heard that three countries in the EU, including Germany, have already stopped extraditing their nationals to the UK since the withdrawal agreement in January. This means that if the German suspect in the Madeleine McCann case were charged, he would be unlikely to be sent to the UK for trial. Also at risk if there is no Brexit security deal is police access to the Schengen Information System (SIS2), which gives instant cross-border records on goods and people. The UK is one of the most frequent users of the SIS2 database, accessing it 603m times last year, Martin told MPs. '[SIS2] It's at your fingertips, it's live time, it's immediate. If we lose that capability, we will revert to Interpol notices which are slightly different They don't have the full capability of SIS2,'Martin said. 'Our use of the European arrest warrant combined with SIS2 means that my officer, who may be in uniform stopping a car on the streets of London, can identify somebody immediately if they are may be wanted for murder in France. Or one of our other member states can immediately arrest them and put them through the extradition process,'he said. 'The worst-case scenario is my officer is left in an ambiguous position where [if] they do stop a car, they do stop somebody that's wanted for a very serious offence. And if there are no other grounds to arrest that person there and then, they've got to run off to Westminster magistrates court, which is the only court in the land that can issue the warrant. So, yes, there's a big risk that they could have abscond or disappear,'he said. EU member states would lose the same ability to instantly ascertain information about suspects wanted by British forces. Valsamis Mitsilegas, professor of European criminal law at Queen Mary University of London, told MPs it would be 'extremely difficult'to get a deal to access SIS without accepting a role for the European court of justice, one of the UK's red lines. Martin spoke of the ease with which police forces across Europe currently cooperate with meetings effortlessly set up in Europol's HQ in The Hague. 'You've probably got nine to 10 countries on each floor, so it really is as easy as popping three feet down the corridor and talking to your French, Italian, Polish [counterparts],'he said. If there was no agreement, the UK would have to move out of the Europol offices but would likely keep a presence in The Hague, just as other non EU countries do such as the US and Australia, Martin added.

The Guardian view on Brexit and trade: an expensive geography lesson,0.5,Positive,"It is possible that Boris Johnson meant it when he said last year that Brexit would not involve checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but only if he did not understand the deal he had signed. His position made sense as dishonesty or ignorance. It was never true. As Brexit talks continue in London this week, it turns out the government has submitted to the EU its application to put border control posts at Irish Sea ports. That is a necessary act of compliance with the Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement. Since Brussels demands that the single market boundary be policed, and the UK made a commitment not to police it on the island of Ireland, a sea border was inevitable. That did not stop Mr Johnson pretending otherwise. On Wednesday a leaked cabinet letter revealed that the border risks being dysfunctional even after the prime minister's scheme is enacted. The root of these problems is the failure to grasp the importance of the single market to the European project and a refusal to acknowledge the cost of Britain's departure from it. Eurosceptic arguments asserted the primacy of markets elsewhere in the world, in search of which Britain needed release from burdensome Brussels rules. The fact that more than 40% of UK exports go to the EU was dismissed as a relic of membership. The geographical proximity of those markets was belittled as an obsolete 20th-century metric. But proximity matters to the EU, which sees in Brexit the prospect of commercial rivals trading into the single market from a low-cost entrep√¥t on their doorstep. Brussels wants to write guarantees against that scenario into a trade deal. UK negotiators resent conditions that they say are more onerous than those applied to Canada, for example. But Canada is thousands of miles further away. Setting aside the question of how reasonable the two sides are being (each could yield a little), the essential problem is that distance matters to trade, and a Brexit model that was conceived in denial of that fact puts the UK at a disadvantage in the negotiations. Fantasy still stalks UK trade policy, as evidenced in Downing Street's nomination of Liam Fox as a candidate to be director general of the World Trade Organization. Dr Fox's cabinet record of resignation in disgrace, then rehabilitation through ineffectual jet-setting, will not be taken seriously in the competition. Mr Johnson defers encounters with reality, but cannot avoid them indefinitely. He will compromise over Brexit, just as he did last year. The only question is whether it happens before or after transitional arrangements end in December. The terms of a deal with Brussels are not so different either side of the deadline, but the cost is higher if it is missed. In either case, Brexit is proving to be a slow and expensive way to teach the prime minister about geography. ",0.25,Positive
Boris Johnson's 'revolutionary new deal' is a hollow distraction,0.375,Positive,"Governments between elections are like ships on open water. They cannot be relaunched. The captain can only promise that storms will pass, while the passengers' patience depends on how long they have been at sea. That is tricky to measure on board HMS Boris Johnson. The Tory leader has not yet completed a year in Downing Street but his party has done a decade in power. Johnson does not see himself on a continuous line of succession after Theresa May and David Cameron, and last year's election result supported that view. The blurring of party lines and straining of public patience during the Brexit endgame last autumn opened a unique electoral window for an incumbent to campaign as an insurgent. Then the pandemic swept in, making 2019 feel like a distant epoch. Johnson wants to reinforce mental barriers between the present and the recent past. On Tuesday he tried to reset political clocks with a faux inaugural address, pledging 'not just to defeat coronavirus but to use this crisis finally to tackle this country's great unresolved challenges of the last three decades'ù. There will be a 'new deal'of investment programmes. Planning law will be relaxed to stimulate reconstruction of a shattered country. It had been briefed that the prime minister was casting himself as the heir to Franklin Roosevelt but explicit mention of the former US president was excised overnight. The rhetorical pivot away from austerity began last year and the sums involved are not, in any case, tide-turning. The improbable reach for historical majesty in the speech wasn't new either. Johnson issues promises like counterfeit money, with himself pasted over the portraits of greater men. The more revealing exposition of governing intent came in a weekend lecture by Michael Gove, who has more Whitehall experience than the prime minister and more polished ideas about how it should work. Gove's argument was that the civil service machine is dilettante, risk averse, prone to inertia and immune to innovation. It needs more scientists, specialists, data-crunchers, outsiders and disrupters. It is a substantial critique but not an original one. Tony Blair created a special delivery unit at the start of his second term to pump prime ministerial writ more aggressively through clogged Whitehall pipes. Since then a digital revolution has exposed more problems with an analogue state, but that obstacle can be exaggerated. The Treasury isn't full of quills and abacuses. The real frustration for this government is not that some external system is thwarting their agenda, but that they are the system and complaining about being thwarted is the only agenda they know. The Johnson project was assembled from Eurosceptic complaints about bureaucrats in Brussels sapping national vigour. It was propelled to power by the refinement and ignition of public anger over delays in implementing the referendum mandate, some of which was blamed on remainer cells in government. Now it turns out that 'remain'was not an opinion on EU membership after all, but an incurable corruption of the soul. Those who have it cannot be trusted to deliver Johnsonism, which has no more precise definition than the commitment to government purged of heretics, regardless of what they actually think about Europe. Mark Sedwill, the country's most senior civil servant and a legacy office-holder from the May era, is being shunted out of his post. David Frost, Johnson's Brexit negotiator, is being elevated to the role of national security adviser, a post for which his qualifications are obedience and an authentically fanatical Eurosceptic glint in the eye. That doesn't correspond with Gove's paean to technical mastery and independent thinking, but the contradiction is generic to revolutionary regimes. The declared purpose is always liberation, pitched as a restoration of power to ordinary citizens. But then the politburo locates a problem in the transmission mechanism bringing paradise to the people. It is steeped in wicked old thinking. An ideological vanguard has to occupy key posts to lubricate the flow of righteous ideas. The fact that Brexit is a project born on the right does not exempt it from the rule that revolutions need commissars to keep unenlightened functionaries in line. Decentralisation is the plan, but only once enough people have been appointed who will take dictation from the centre. What makes the Johnson junta more unusual is that it reached its declared utopia too soon. Legally and in the minds of most voters Brexit is done. The ideological bolt has been shot. There is nothing else in the prime minister's declared agenda that can't be delivered by the British state as traditionally configured. Planning reform is the most controversial part, but there will be more resistance on that front from grassroots Tories than civil servants. Old-fashioned money and competence will decide whether the mission is accomplished, not hunting remainers under Whitehall desks. It is hard to see what actual policy purpose the revolutionary ethos serves. It is sustained by the macho thrill of combat for its own sake, and as displacement activity because emancipation from Brussels doesn't achieve any of its advertised benefits for more efficient government. The bogus war-footing is a way to deny the decade of Tory incumbency; to buy time before too many voters join the dots between this government and its predecessors. There is radicalism in this approach but it is strangely hollow. It has a make-believe quality, as when a child gets more play out of the packaging than the gift. Johnson said he wanted Brexit so badly, he stamped his feet and got it for Christmas. But he cast the thing itself aside and sits in the empty box, brrm-brrming, beep-beeping excitedly, going nowhere. '¢ Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist ",0.75,Positive
Britain and Brussels turn on each other for prolonging City's uncertainty,0,Neutral,"Britain and Brussels have each accused the other of holding up a decision on the City of London's ability to do business in EU markets from next year, prolonging the financial services' state of uncertainty about the future. Both parties had agreed to complete assessments of the other's regulatory regimes for financial services by Tuesday 30 June, with the expectation that they would deemed 'equivalent'ù, allowing business to continue in the new year. With the deadline for an equivalence decision likely to be missed, the financial sectors on both sides have been left in the dark about the future terms of business, and the European commission and the UK government have blamed each other for the delay. The UK is currently still in the single market and customs union, but that transition period, following the country's exit from the EU, ends on 31 December. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, told the Eurofi financial regulation thinktank that the UK had answered only four of 28 questionnaires Brussels had sent seeking information about the regulation of financial services. 'So we are not there yet,'he said. 'We will only grant equivalences in those areas where it is clearly in the interest of the EU; of our financial stability; our investors and our consumers.'He reiterated a warning that equivalence could not legally be given to providers of insurance, commercial bank lending or deposit-taking. In response, a Treasury spokesman compared the commission's slow work with Whitehall's efficiency in examining the level of equivalence of the two regulatory systems. The spokesman said: 'Both sides committed to completing equivalence assessments ahead of the summer. As the UK and EU start from a position of having similar financial services regulation, this should be a straightforward process. 'The UK has been able to complete our own assessments on time and we are now ready to reach comprehensive findings of equivalence as soon as the EU is able to clarify its own position.'There are concerns in the British government that the EU wants to delay a decision until there is clarity over the ongoing negotiations over a trade and security deal. It is understood that the government received 1,000-plus pages of questions in April and May, with the last 248 pages arriving on 25 May. British officials are understood to be frustrated that the questions posed are fara broader in range than necessary for an equivalence decision to be reached. If Brussels decides that the UK's regulatory regime is equivalent to its own, market access to British companies is expected to follow. But Barnier, in his appearance via video message at the thinktank event, appeared to confirm Britain's fears over the EU's motivation by suggesting that Brussels wanted to be able to take into account the wider picture. 'These assessments are particularly challenging,'Barnier said. 'Firstly, because they have to be forward-looking, given the UK's publicly stated intention to diverge from EU rules after 1 January 2021. Last week, the UK published a paper on its future regulatory framework for financial services. This is a useful document. We are now analysing it in detail to gain clarity on how UK rules will evolve. He added: 'But let us have no illusions: the UK will progressively start diverging from the EU framework. This is even one of the main purposes of Brexit.'The row broke out as the UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, and Barnier resumed talks over a comprehensive free trade deal, their first face-to-face meeting in Brussels since February. The equivalence decision is outside the negotiation, but the two teams are seeking to agree on a form of cooperation on regulation of the financial services sector. Barnier said he could not accept the UK proposals, which he described as seeking 'the benefits of the single market without the obligations'ù. He accused the UK of trying to limit the EU's ability to unilaterally withdraw 'equivalence'in the future - a claim British officials denied, saying they were merely looking for ample warning and assurances of equitable treatment. Barnier also said the UK government was trying to 'make it easy to continue to run EU businesses from London, with minimal operations and staff on the continent'ù.  ",0,Neutral
The Guardian view on a Brexit purge: official dissent is patriotic,0.125,Positive,"Boris Johnson got rid of the head of the UK's civil service because he was not 'one of us'ù. Sir Mark Sedwill's card had been marked early on. He was appointed by Theresa May, who despite her professed zeal for exiting the European Union never escaped - for Brexiters - the fact that she had voted to remain. The cabinet secretary, along with the top mandarins at the Home Office and the Foreign Office, were in the minds of leavers part of the ancien regime that was out to subvert the will of the people. They have been swept away by Mr Johnson's Brexit revolution. Vote Leave is now in Downing Street, and Brexit is being repurposed to destabilise officials' authority by casting their reasonable objections as signs of how out of step they are with voters' mood. Sir Mark wore two hats: cabinet secretary and national security adviser. He was impartial and had strong intelligence credentials. Sir Mark's replacement in the defence role, Sir David Frost, has no security background. But most importantly, Sir David loathes the EU and Sir Mark does not. If this ideological cleansing via hostile anonymised briefing is allowed to continue unchecked, it will blow away the defining qualities of the British civil service: political neutrality and recruitment on the basis of merit. It is true that these ideals have been chipped away for decades. Both Labour and Tory governments have been accused of politicising Whitehall. But the danger with Mr Johnson, and his Vote Leave acolytes Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings, is that they are using the old canard of a civil service priesthood, one wedded to its own value systems, to prosecute a purge of critics and cow dissent. There could be profound changes ahead and none for the betterment of the country. One of the distinguishing features of the British state is that there is a level of continuity when officials transfer between administrations without a clean sweep of top posts, as happens in the United States. The departures at the top of the civil service in recent weeks will have a chilling effect on officials lower down the food chain, who may think again about speaking truth to power. This will be reinforced by the impression that Sir Mark has been forced to take the blame for the UK's inept response to the coronavirus crisis. Before the Johnson premiership, it was cabinet ministers, not civil servants, who were meant to carry the can for mistakes in public, even if things went wrong in places over which they did not have direct control. The traditional system is designed to bring disparate viewpoints to the table and to widen the scope of deliberation. It is meant to slow and water down poorly thought out proposals. Brexiters cast this prudence as being risk-averse, claiming it discourages innovation. But officials elevated for political loyalty are unlikely to say no to a prime minister insistent on going ahead with a wasteful pet wheeze. Future cabinet secretaries will not conduct an investigation in which a member of the cabinet is found to be at fault if they end up the guilty party. Ministers and officials are indissolubly mixed up with each other. They function in a close partnership, where each has the trust and respect of the other. Ministers must understand that an apparently wearisome official is in fact an essential protection against their own folly. Mr Johnson thinks that to get things done he must first fix the machinery of government. That may be true, but he won't succeed by breaking the wheels of the state. ",0.125,Positive

The European constitutional treaty had just been rejected in France and the Netherlands, and we had set ourselves the task of shaping a new treaty. We succeeded in that. Then came the international financial crisis, turbulence for the euro and the refugee issue - so difficult times are nothing new. And time and again it has been shown that Europe is not yet sufficiently resistant to crises. In the euro crisis, we lacked the tools for an appropriate response. The movements of refugees in 2015 showed up the deficiencies of the EU asylum system. Now the coronavirus pandemic is confronting us with a challenge of unprecedented dimensions. It has struck us all indiscriminately. On the one hand, it has torn us away from a period of positive economic development in all EU member states. On the other hand, it has coincided with the two great disruptive phenomena of our time, climate change and the digital revolution, which are changing our lives and our economies regardless of the virus. I am very sharply focused on all of this. Given the sheer number of crises, is the EU's survival on the line? Rather than ask the existential question too often, we should get on with the day job. It is very much in all the member states' own interests to maintain a strong European internal market and to stand united on the world stage. In such an extraordinary situation, I rely on the member states having a great interest in the things that unite us. The crisis has not just struck Europe; the whole world is fighting the pandemic as well as political demons. Exactly, and it is true that the tone of international discourse is brusque at the moment. After the 2008 financial crisis, multilateralism was the order of the day. That was when the G20 started meeting at the level of heads of state or government, and the countries gave a very unified response. That is not the case today. These days, we have to do all we can to stop ourselves collapsing into protectionism. If Europe wants to be heard, then it needs to set a good example. I am counting on it - though I am under no illusions about how difficult the negotiations will be. Your proposal for a recovery fund was a major concession to the southern countries. What reform efforts are you expecting in return? I don't find it helpful to talk about the northern countries, the southern countries and the eastern Europeans. That is seeing things in black and white. I expect each of us always to put ourselves in the other person's shoes and consider problems from the other's point of view. The group known as the 'òfrugal four' is pursuing a defensive approach. Why has Germany left the cautious camp? For Italy and Spain, for example, the coronavirus pandemic signifies a huge burden in economic, medical and, of course, because of the many lives lost, emotional terms. In these circumstances, it is only right for Germany to think not just about itself but to be prepared to engage in an extraordinary act of solidarity. It was in that spirit that French President Emmanuel Macron and I made our proposal. Going into higher levels of debt is a U-turn for Germany. What happened to the chancellor with the tight purse strings? In a crisis of this magnitude, each and every one of us is expected to do what needs to be done. What needs to be done in this case is something extraordinary. Germany had a low debt ratio and can afford, in this extraordinary situation, to take on some more debt. It is also very important to us to keep the programme within the bounds of the European treaties. We have found a way to do that. And all this is in our own interests too, of course. It is in Germany's interest to have a strong internal market and to have the European Union grow closer together, not fall apart. As ever, what's good for Europe is good for us. The recovery fund has generated an odd kind of harmony. Is the money drawing a veil over the real problems of burgeoning nationalism and latent populism? The recovery fund cannot solve all of Europe's problems. But not having it would make all our problems worse. Europe's economic health can influence so many things. Very high unemployment in a country can become politically explosive and thereby increase the threat to democracy. For Europe to survive, its economy needs to survive. Might the recovery fund spark movement towards a United States of Europe? I see this fund as a unique response to a unique situation. If we wanted to change fundamental aspects of the way the EU budget is managed or, for instance, give it the right to raise taxes, then we would have to amend the treaties. That would alter the static equilibrium between competence and oversight. I am sure this will be discussed in the years ahead, but that should be done cautiously. In the current situation, however, we could not wait for the treaties to be amended. We have to respond quickly to the pandemic. Do you think Nadia Calvi√±o [Spain's economic affairs minister] would make a good Eurogroup president? The finance ministers are discussing that at the moment. It is no secret that there is support for Nadia Calvi√±o's candidature in the German government. But the final decision lies with the Eurogroup. I am always pleased when women get leading political roles, and the Eurogroup has never been headed by a woman. But it's not my decision. This is for the Eurogroup to decide. Should Italy use what the European stability mechanism has to offer? That is Italy's decision to make. We have created these instruments through the EIB [the European Investment Bank]: the ESM with its precautionary credit lines and the Sure short-time work scheme. Anyone can make use of them. We didn't make them available for them to remain unused. You are the last head of government left of the 1989 generation. You experienced the eastern bloc and European unification. Is it not the case that Europe is drifting apart in spite of the pandemic-related efforts? Can the younger heads of government still find a common language? Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orb√°n, was already politically active in 1989 too. Back then, the liberal democratic order had initially triumphed over the dictatorship of socialism and communism. But that was only part of the reality. Conflicts broke out in the western Balkans and later in the Islamic world. China rose to become a major economic power. Indeed, the example of China shows that even an undemocratic state can be economically successful, which is a major challenge for our liberal democracies. Then came the challenge of Islamist terrorism, particularly the attack on the United States of 11 September 2001. Add to this the disappointment that followed the Arab spring. In short, we have not yet been able to furnish absolute proof that the liberal system is about to win the day. That worries me. Has Europe not reaped the benefits of its revolution? Yes and no. On the one hand, we have enjoyed an incredible success story since 1989, but in our euphoria we failed to fully realise what long-term traces dictatorships had left in the 40 years since the second world war. After national socialism and the second world war, many countries in eastern Europe went straight into a second period of dictatorship. The countries of the eastern bloc had only a few years to develop their own national identities. So only later did they undergo processes that had long been part of normal life in western countries. Many young EU accession countries share our enthusiasm for the European Union as a work of peace on the one hand, yet display scepticism towards Europe on the other. We need to develop understanding for that. I see my job as working for a self-determined, liberal Europe rooted in the fundamental rights of the individual. With all due respect to differences of historical experience, where do you draw the line on violating the rule of law? We will, of course, talk about issues relating to the rule of law. The hallmark of democracy is that any opposition must have a fair chance of returning to government. An opposition must be guaranteed a clear set of rights - starting with appropriate speaking time in parliaments and at least the same amount of airtime from public broadcasters, and extending to an independent judiciary and adherence to democratic rules. Is European legislation now in breach of national legislation - or vice versa? Doesn't the European legal system ultimately need to have more weight than national ones as a matter of principle? It's not as if this topic was never talked about before the federal constitutional court issued its judgment on the European Central Bank. Without a doubt, European law has precedence over national law - but that does not tell us where the realm of European law begins and ends. The essence of the European Union lies in the member states transferring powers. In the borderland between the spheres of jurisdiction of national and European law, friction can occur if the European level defines its limits more broadly than, for example, the German parliament does. That's what we are seeing in the ECB case. If the constitutional court finds that a boundary has been crossed, it goes to the European court of justice and requests a review. Up until now, all disagreements have been settled. Now we have a conflict. That is the nature of the beast, since a nation state will always be able to lay claim to particular powers unless all powers are transferred to the European institutions, which is surely not going to happen. The presidency wanted to find a joint strategy for dealing with China. Is that still realistic? Because of the pandemic, we cannot hold the summit with China in September as planned. But we intend to hold it later. Its objective is to advance EU-Chinese relations. We share common interests, such as cooperating on climate action. We have been negotiating an investment agreement for some time but are not really moving forward on that. We should discuss our development policies in Africa, where China is following a different path in some areas. At the same time, the summit is forcing us to develop a joint European position vis-√†-vis China. That is no easy task. We should develop a policy that reflects our interests and values. After all, respect for human rights, the rule of law and our concerns about the future of Hong Kong stand between China and ourselves and are addressed openly. Is China calling the western, democratic edifice of Europe into question? We should start by doing everything we can to make ourselves more resilient. We need to stand together as Europeans, otherwise we will only weaken ourselves. China has become a global player. That makes us partners in economic cooperation and combating climate change, but also competitors with very different political systems. Not to talk to each other would certainly be a bad idea. A no-deal Brexit is looming at the end of the year. Would that be a personal defeat for you? No. It would, of course, be in Britain's and all EU member states' interests to achieve an orderly departure. But that can only happen if it is what both sides want. What matters is not our wishes but only the reality before us, in other words first of all what Britain wants. With Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the British government wants to define for itself what relationship it will have with us after the country leaves. It will then have to live with the consequences, of course, that is to say with a less closely interconnected economy. If Britain does not want to have rules on the environment and the labour market or social standards that compare with those of the EU, our relations will be less close. That will mean it does not want standards to go on developing along parallel lines. We need to let go of the idea that it is for us to define what Britain should want. That is for Britain to define - and we, the EU27, will respond appropriately. The United States has also been rushing to loosen its bonds with Europe. President Trump criticises Germany and wants to withdraw troops. Are you impressed by that threat? We believe that the alliance is of great value to each of its members. We in Germany know that we have to spend more on defence; we have achieved considerable increases in recent years, and we will continue on that path to enhance our military capabilities. American troops in Germany help to protect not only Germany and the European part of Nato but also the interests of the United States of America. Has the time come for the EU to gain strategic autonomy and actual sovereignty? Look at the world; look at China or India. There are compelling reasons to remain committed to a transatlantic defence community and our shared nuclear umbrella. But of course Europe needs to carry more of the burden than during the cold war. We grew up in the certain knowledge that the United States wanted to be a world power. Should the US now wish to withdraw from that role of its own free will, we would have to reflect on that very deeply. In eastern Europe in particular, the threat emanating from Russia is felt very strongly. Is Germany underestimating that threat? We recognise misinformation campaigns; the weapons of hybrid warfare, as it is called, are part of Russia's arsenal '¶ '¶ even a murder, apparently '¶ '¶ the murder in Berlin's Tiergarten park is a serious incident, obviously, the blame for which is currently being ascertained in court. At any rate, we recognise hybrid warfare, methods of destabilisation, as a Russian behaviour pattern. On the other hand, there are good reasons to keep engaging in constructive dialogue with Russia. In countries like Syria and Libya, countries in Europe's immediate neighbourhood, Russia's strategic influence is great. I will therefore continue to strive for cooperation. ",0,Neutral
Russia report: UK MPs condemn 'utterly reprehensible' delay,0,Neutral,"The government's apparent refusal to release a report into Russian infiltration in the UK and to delay establishing a key scrutiny committee has been condemned as unprecedented and 'utterly reprehensible'ù. The Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) has not met since before the general election in December - its longest break since it was established in 1994 - and critics say the government has sat on the committee's report into Russian interference for nine months. The former chair of the committee Dominic Grieve said the report had been sent to Downing Street on 17 October and was ready for publication once it had been signed off, a process that usually takes up to 10 days. The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson, Alistair Carmichael, said: 'Given the prime minister has for nine months sat on the intelligence committee report into Russian interference of our democracy, his decision to delay nominations to the committee raises serious ethical questions. 'This unprecedented underhand behaviour is utterly reprehensible. It leaves the public in little doubt that Boris Johnson is avoiding the truth about the Tory party's funding connections to Russian oligarchs.'Thirty cross-party MPs wrote to the prime minister earlier this week urging for the reconstitution of the committee, saying the refusal to publish the report raised serious questions about the 'transparency and integrity'of the democratic process. It said: 'The publication last month of the latest donations to the Conservative party has highlighted once again the party's deep connections to Russian oligarchs, raising further questions as to why you are so reluctant to reconstitute the ISC. 'According to the Hansard Society, 'òat nearly six months, the time taken to appoint the ISC on this occasion has now exceeded that taken to appoint the committee after every previous general election since the committee was established in 1994'. 'It is untenable for you to continue to block the publication of the Russia report. The situation is an affront to democracy.'The ISC is one of the most important committees in parliament, overseeing seven agencies and departments involved in UK intelligence. Conor McGinn, the shadow Home Office minister, tweeted: 'It is deeply worrying that the government is preventing the Intelligence and Security Committee from doing its vital work. It must be allowed to publish the delayed Russia report and get on with its important role overseeing UK intelligence.' The Scottish National party's Ian Blackford, a former member of the committee, has accused the government of 'repeatedly and intentionally failing to establish parliament's intelligence and security committee to escape scrutiny on important security matters'ù. Ministers were told earlier this year they can no longer say there have been 'no successful examples'of Russian disinformation affecting UK elections, after the apparent hacking of an NHS dossier seized on by Labour during the last campaign. Ahead of the election in December, fresh evidence emerged of attempts by a senior Russian diplomat, Sergey Nalobin - who once described the future prime minister as 'our good friend'- to cultivate leading Tories during his five years in London . A Downing Street spokesperson said: 'Work to establish the committee is ongoing and as quickly as current circumstances allow, and further announcements will be made in due course. 'The Investigatory Powers Act allows the UK to maintain one of the most stringent scrutiny regimes in the world through the investigatory powers commissioner, the investigatory powers tribunal and both executive and judicial oversight.'According to the Times, the holdup to the formation of the intelligence watchdog can partially be explained by the removal of a provisional member, Tory MP Theresa Villiers, by No 10 for disloyalty. She defied the party whip on an amendment that would have banned the import of chlorinated chicken in any US trade deal.  Former security minister John Hayes and former transport secretary Chris Grayling have been chosen by Johnson to be on the committee, the latter as chair, the paper said. ",0,Neutral
"Northern Irish firms to be reimbursed for tariffs if Brexit talks fail, Gove says",0,Neutral,"The government is to reimburse Northern Irish businesses if they are hit by tariffs due to a collapse in Brexit talks, Michael Gove has said. He revealed the plans after being criticised by MPs over Brexit arrangements for the region. 'We want to make sure that in the event of there not being a free trade agreement of whatever kind with the EU that we are in a position to indemnify and reimburse companies for tariffs,'the minister for the Cabinet Office told the Northern Ireland affairs select committee. If there is no deal a unique arrangement for Northern Ireland kicks in, with EU tariffs payable on goods circulating within the region but rebates on all goods that do not cross into the Republic of Ireland. Secondary legislation would be required for the tariff arrangements but this would be put in place before January, Gove told the committee. Business leaders described the move as 'significant'but expressed concern about the lack of detail. 'What paperwork would be needed? How long would it be for reimbursement as that is a huge cashflow problem?'said Aodh√°n Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland retail consortium. He also said the EU state-aid rules would make the scheme problematic for big companies. Importers of cars, for example, would face a 10% additional levy on purchases from Nissan in Great Britain without any knowledge of when they could get a rebate. Further, the state aid rules would prevent them from receiving anything more than £200,000 over three years, limiting the number of cars they could buy in from Great Britain. Unusually for Gove, a cabinet minister renowned for his capacity for detail, little flesh was added to the bones of the protocol arrangements he recently published as part of a 'command paper'ù.He was unable to answer repeated questions by the Labour MP Hilary Benn about whether entry summary declaration forms would be needed for Great British businesses selling into Northern Ireland. These are currently needed for goods brought into the UK from outside the EU. Gove conceded that new safety and security information would be needed but the operational detail would not be revealed until later in the summer. Businesses, unions and farmers at an earlier Labour webinar expressed their frustration with the government's failure to provide greater detail. Victor Chestnutt, the deputy president of the Ulster Farmers' Union, said planning for January was 'like walking out into the mist, into the fog'ù. The committee chairman, Simon Hoare, said the apparent 'open skies'thinking was risky. 'Six months out, [it] seems to be playing with fire,'said the Conservative MP for North Dorset. He added that trying to get firm information out of Gove and the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, made him feel like 'Alice through the looking glass [trying to divine] what words mean'ù.

More than 3.3m EU and EEA citizens granted right to remain in UK,0,Neutral,"More than 3.3 million EU and European Economic Area citizens have been granted the right to remain in the UK after Brexit, the Home Office has said. In its latest update on the EU settled status scheme, it said 57% of those had been granted 'settled status'ù, the term for those who have been able to demonstrate they have been in the country for five years or more. No accurate data on the number of EU citizens living in the country exists but previous estimates have suggested a range of between 3 million and 3.8 million. The figures released on Thursday show a high take-up rate, reflecting the desire of many to remain in the country despite Brexit and despite anxieties often expressed about their futures in the country. The figures also come just days after Michael Gove expressed concern in the House of Commons over reciprocal arrangements in Europe. It is believed that 13 of the 27 member states plan similar systems, including France, which is due to launch a similar system for Britons next month. Those of Polish heritage represented the largest nationality cohort remaining in the UK with 697,000, followed by Romanians, Italians, Portuguese and Spanish. Around 41% of applicants had been granted pre-settled status designed for those who have been in the country for fewer than five years. Of the remaining applications, 28,900 received a withdrawn or void outcome, 14,100 were invalid and 900 were refused. Of the total refusals, 99% were refused on eligibility grounds and 1% (9) were refused on suitability grounds, the Home Office said in a statement. Suitability grounds including those with serious or persistent criminality. EU citizens currently living in the UK have the automatic right to remain in the country after Brexit and have until July next year to apply for status. During the transition period EU citizens continue to have the right to settle in Britain in the same way that UK citizens still retain the right to move and settle to another EU member state. These freedom of movement rights flow from the UK's continued membership of the single market. Future borders and immigration minister, Kevin Foster, said: 'There is still plenty of time to apply before the 30 June 2021 deadline and I encourage all those who haven't already applied to do so now. Support is available online and over the telephone for those with questions or who need help applying.'He said he was pleased that so many had already applied. Overall the total number of applications up to 31 May 2020 was 3,612,400, the government said. ",0,Neutral
UK begins talks with Australia and New Zealand on free trade deal for post-Brexit era,0.625,Positive,"Australia and New Zealand are about to begin negotiations on a free trade agreement with the UK in what the Australian trade minister said was 'a strong signal of our mutual support for free trade'in a post-Covid-19 world. Simon Birmingham said Australia was 'ready to help the UK find new beginnings post-Brexit and in doing so, open up new doors for our farmers, businesses and investors'ù. 'We've been preparing for this deal since the UK decided to leave the EU and welcome their agreement to commence negotiations,'Birmingham said in a statement issued on Wednesday. The UK is Australia's seventh largest trading partner. Birmingham said Australia and the UK hoped to conclude the deal 'as quickly as possible'- possibly by the end of this year, although he conceded that may be an ambitious timeframe. He said both sides wanted 'an ambitious and comprehensive agreement that builds on our already significant people-to-people links and creates new opportunities for exporters, generating more jobs in our nations'ù. 'As both our nations begin to shift our focus towards the economic recovery from Covid-19, a UK-Australia FTA will help to expand choices and export opportunities and secure stronger supply chains to better withstand future shocks,'Birmingham said. New Zealand's trade minister, David Parker, echoed Birmingham's sentiments. 'As the UK embarks on its next steps post-Brexit, New Zealand is pleased to be among the first countries to negotiate a trade agreement with one of our oldest friends,'Parker said. New Zealand and Britain had 'a close relationship, including strong trade and economic ties, common values and traditions and a shared history'ù, he said. The UK is New Zealand's sixth largest trading partner, with two-way trade totalling almost NZ$6bn last year. China, Australia and the EU top New Zealand's list. Parker said talks would focus on removal of trade tariffs, new approaches to non-tariff barriers, streamlined customs, regulatory cooperation, development of digital trade and trade provisions in support of sustainable development - including climate change. New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said she hoped the tariffs of 'over 8% for kiwifruit, roughly 16% for manuka honey'could be reduced. 'As close friends, we look to each other when we have faced challenges, no more so than now as we each work to recover and rebuild from the impacts of Covid-19,'Ardern told reporters. Agriculture will be a hotly contested issue; New Zealand lost its privileged access to the British markets in 1973 when the UK joined the European Economic Community, the precursor to the EU, a slight still felt by some in the primary industries. 'We always run into issues on agricultural access,'said Parker, the trade minister. 'Having said that, I think the United Kingdom is expressing a view that they want to be more open with the rest of the world after Brexit than before, so we are hopeful.'But he warned that nothing would be resolved while Brexit negotiations continue. 'We share an ambition to liberalise tariffs as much as possible, [including] on agricultural goods,'said Laura Clarke, the British high commissioner to New Zealand. 'But also of course the UK would like to see tariffs on gin - currently 5% - reduced, we would like to see the tariffs on car parts - currently 10% - reduce, and so it will be a whole-piece negotiation.'During an address to Australia's National Press Club on Wednesday, Birmingham said Australia would be looking to secure better market access for agriculture, removal of tariffs on wine, and high standard rules on digital trade and investment. The new talks come at a time when Australia is also negotiating a trade agreement with the European Union. Birmingham described the EU as 'a massive high income market of almost 450 million people and as a bloc it's already Australia's third-largest trading partner and our third largest source of foreign investment'ù. Asked whether the UK or EU trade deal was a higher priority for Australia, Birmingham said: 'I don't have any favoured children in that regard - I want to love them both equally.'He acknowledged that the EU was a much bigger market than the UK but he said the latter was also significant, and had a bigger economy than Australia's. 'That means it presents significant opportunities for us,'Birmingham said. 'Back at the time that the UK entered into the European Economic Community it was our third-largest goods trading market. It's now our 12th.'The first round of negotiations between Australia and the UK is due to begin on 29 June, but due to Covid-19 restrictions will be held remotely. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, said this week he hoped to wrap up a trade deal with the EU before the end of July, paving the way for bilateral deals with nations such as Australia and New Zealand. But many obstacles remain, such as agreement on fisheries. Britain has also set out its plans for deals with the US and Japan.  ",2.5,Positive
Poll: UK government losing public approval over handling of virus,-0.5,Negative,"Less than a third of the public now approve of the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. The poll found that approval of the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis is down four points to a new low. Only three in 10 people approve, giving the government an overall approval rating of -18 for its handling of the pandemic. However, the pollsters found that disapproval of the way Boris Johnson is acting as prime minister appears to have levelled off, with no significant increases in either approval or disapproval over the past three weeks. He has a net approval score of -6 points. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer's approval ratings remain very high on +24, but have dropped four points since last week. Johnson still only has a one-point lead when voters are asked who makes the best prime minister - a historic low for him. After seeing their poll lead shrink 23 points in the previous eight weeks, the Conservatives saw a slight increase over Labour this week. Their share of the vote went up 43% to 44%, while Labour suffered its first dip since the second week of April, down one point to 39%. There are also signs that Brexit is re-emerging as an issue occupying the minds of voters. While dropping from the most important issue because of the coronavirus crisis, Opinium found it is 'slowly but surely making a comeback'and is now just five points away from being level with the economy in terms of importance to voters. Meanwhile, support is high for the government's handling over the forcible removal of the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, with over half of UK adults saying they disapprove of the protestors who pulled it down. Approval for the protestors is highest in London, at 42%. Whilst 39% would have supported the removal of the statue of Colston by the local authority, 31% actively would have actively opposed this. Opinium polled 2,001 people online between 11 and 12 June. ",-0.875,Negative
"The Observer view: as Britain flounders, Europe charts its recovery",0,Neutral,"If the struggle against the pandemic resembles a war, as Boris Johnson believes, then it's pretty clear who is losing. By any pertinent measure, including the most damning one - the number of excess deaths compared with last year - Britain is being outdone by countries across Europe, most notably Germany. Johnson dislikes international comparisons. It's shamefully obvious why. Britain is not second rate. He is. Late into lockdown, late on PPE, late on testing, test and trace, late on halting the avoidable care homes catastrophe and late on the reopening of schools, Johnson's government now lags behind in launching an economic stimulus package to mitigate the potentially disastrous long-term effects of the virus. Last week's report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development shows just how urgent the need is. Britain's economy is likely to suffer the worst damage of any country in the developed world, with a projected 2020 fall in national income of 11.5% amid un-budgeted, virus-related costs of £133bn. Germany's shortfall in contrast will be 6.6%, the OECD predicted. This is not happening because Britain is unlucky. It's happening because of its relative failure to suppress the virus and the resulting, ongoing restrictions on economic activity. The comparative slowness of Britain's recovery stems from this continuing inability to safely reboot key sectors such as services - hospitality, shops, restaurants and pubs. Dithering over the arbitrary 'two metre rule'is one example of how the government makes matters worse. Another is the delay to the promised stimulus package and Johnson's elusive economic recovery bill, now expected by the autumn. It should be plain to even the meanest ministerial intelligence that Britain is in the process of swapping a health emergency for an economic and social emergency. This nightmare is underscored daily by pre-emptive and, in some cases, opportunistic job cuts by companies ranging from Rolls-Royce and Centrica to British Airways and other carmakers. Tourism's revival has been needlessly handicapped by Priti Patel's mishandled border quarantine. Lockdown produced a record 20% slump in Britain's GDP in April. There has been a modest increase since, but nothing like fast or deep enough. The ongoing damage to the public finances, and thus to public services, manufacturing, retail and jobs, is alarming - and possibly irreparable. It follows that every means must be employed to address it, which is why Johnson, instead of getting shirty over unfavourable comparisons, should look to Europe. In fact, the prime minister is doing the exact opposite. Rather than learn by example, and profit by collaboration, he turns Britain's back. While the prime minister was focused on reopening zoos, Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, was implementing a £130bn (£116bn) domestic stimulus package to invest in 50 growth-promoting projects. That's in addition to earlier huge relief measures. EU countries together will soon benefit from £500bn in non-repayable grants that Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, have agreed are necessary to restore economic health and make up for a lack of solidarity early on in the pandemic. The European Central Bank has also increased lending to states and banks. The 27 EU members expect to lift all internal border controls by month's end, another big boost for business, trade and holidays. Where is Britain as our neighbours' recovery quickens? Out in the cold, unable to take advantage of these sensible, collective measures. Dogmatic, intransigent and reckless to the last, Johnson's government is still insisting instead that the Brexit transition period, without which Britain might have faced food shortages at the height of the pandemic, will end on 31 December. It claims to serve the will of the people. In truth, it is sheer wilfulness. The main reason why negotiations on the future trade relationship with Europe are stalled is Johnson's petulant insistence on having his cake and eating it, or cherrypicking, as the EU calls it. He knows his stance on regulations, laws and fisheries brings a disastrous no-deal Brexit closer by the day. He ignores warnings by organisations that, unlike him, understand business, such as the CBI, that such an outcome would be 'a major block to recovery'ù. Johnson knows the extensive new border and customs infrastructure, and the hiring of an additional 50,000 paper-pushers that a no-deal Brexit would make necessary, is nowhere near ready. That is why the government was obliged last week to abandon checks on EU imports for at least the first six months of 2021. Johnson surely knows that many virus-stricken companies lack the resilience to weather another self-inflicted crisis. The prime minister knows, too, that the Americans are watching this play out, ready to exploit British neediness to impose their objectionable terms for a bilateral free trade agreement. And as for a fair deal with China after Huawei, go whistle. So who now are Britain's friends? Johnson knows all this, but does not seem to care. On the pandemic, on economic recovery, on Brexit, he blunders blindly on, blagging and bragging, trashing the country as he goes. This is not taking back control. This is a prime minister who has lost control.   ",0,Neutral
Brexit: UK fears EU chief negotiator has lost grip on fishing talks,-1.5,Negative,"Downing Street fears that Michel Barnier has lost his grip†on the fishing negotiations, throwing doubt over Boris Johnson's hopes of a summer of swift and definitive progress towards a trade and security deal with the EU. The bloc's chief negotiator had been expected to present a compromise proposal on access to British waters during the talks last week but was blocked at the last minute by member states with large fishing communities. British sources said an unexpected decision by fisheries ministers at a meeting with Barnier to reject a move away from their hardline position had 'skewed things late in the process'ù, preventing a middle ground being found. Despite four rounds of talks on fisheries by videoconference call last week, a time commitment unmatched for any other issue, both sides confirmed on Friday that there had been no progress towards a deal.  Barnier said 'the EU wants the status quo, the UK wants to change everything'ù, but called for discussions 'somewhere between'ù. As a result of the surprise logjam, recent discussions between the sides on moving the negotiations into a new intensive phase of face-to-face talks between Barnier and his counterpart, David Frost, in July have become more difficult. Downing Street wants to swiftly enter a 'tunnel phase'over the summer during which member states would entrust Barnier to thrash out a trade and security deal without constant intervention by the EU capitals. France, the Netherlands, Spain, Ireland, Denmark, Belgium, Germany and Sweden have not yet offered their negotiator any flexibility on the key issue of fishing rights despite Barnier's public calls for both sides to move from their 'maximalist'positions. The EU now expects the talks to drag into October, a suggestion that senior UK sources insist is unacceptable given the need for businesses on both sides to prepare for the new trading environment that will come from any deal. Downing Street hopes Barnier will try again to move the EU capitals towards compromise.  'We are now at an important moment for these talks,'a government spokesman said. 'If we are to make progress, it is clear that we must intensify and accelerate our work.†Any such deal must of course accommodate the reality of the UK's well-established position on the so-called level playing field, on fisheries, and the other difficult issues.'When it comes to fishing rights, the EU wants to emulate the strictures of the common fisheries policy (CFP) from the end of 2020 when the UK leaves the transition period during which it has remained in the bloc's single market and customs union. Under the CFP, the total allowable catch figures for different species of fish are negotiated annually by fisheries ministers. The respective share that each member state's fleet then takes is based on catches recorded in the 1970s. British fishing communities have long claimed that the policy has left them with far too few fish to catch with notable inequities including that French fishermen have 84% of the cod quota in the English Channel. The UK is insisting it will be an independent coastal state from the end of 2020 and that there needs to be a new relationship with the EU in this area, similar to that enjoyed by Norway. The British negotiating side wants fishing rights to depend on where the fish live - a model known as zonal attachment. Frost has informed Barnier, however, that other factors such as the effect on coastal communities and longstanding rights could be a factor in annual negotiations to ensure that European fishing communities are not left bereft. Barnier had been expected to provide some data on how such external factors would affect the rights to catches but sources said that failed to materialise in the last week. 'Until they give us some more, there is no way of using that to derive hard information about the numbers,'one UK source said. 'That appears to be the difficulty. If they could do it we would happily talk to them about it and see what could be done.'",-1.875,Negative
Stormont backs calling for extension to Brexit transition period,0,Neutral,"The Northern Ireland assembly has unexpectedly voted in favour of calling for an extension to the Brexit transition period, arguing that the UK government cannot impose complex border checks down the Irish Sea while Britain is occupied with the coronavirus crisis.† In a surprise development, nationalist, green and social democratic parties held sway in Stormont, saying business cannot prepare for a no-deal Brexit in the middle of a pandemic.† The motion proposed Matthew O'Toole, the SDLP's Brexit spokesman, had not been expected to carry after opposition was expressed by the Democratic Unionist and the Ulster Unionist parties. O'Toole, a former Downing Street adviser, said London would have to take the vote seriously as the assembly was 'uniquely recognised as a named party in the withdrawal agreement'and Stormont had a substantial role in the implementation of the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol.† He said: 'This is not about rerunning the referendum, it's about accepting that we are in the middle of the most serious public health crisis in living memory. We are also facing a significant economic recession that will put businesses and jobs at risk. This is not the moment to attempt to rupture and renegotiate our largest trading relationship.'O'Toole added that the Stormont vote would 'send a powerful message'to Boris Johnson in relation to his implacable opposition to extending the transition period without consent from Northern Ireland. The special protocol on Northern Ireland was agreed in January after a deal struck by the prime minister and his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, to avoid a border on the island of Ireland.† It involves checks on trade crossing the Irish Sea which will come into effect as soon as the transition period ends, whether there is a trade deal or not. Under the withdrawal agreement, these checks would hold for at least six years. Businesses have said there is simply not enough time to put IT systems for new customs arrangements, VAT and regulatory checks in place. Both the DUP and the UUP voted against the motion, having argued on Monday that it would be better to postpone such a move until the outcome of this week's Brexit talks between Brussels and London was known.† Green party MLA Rachel Woods said businesses were already facing survival issues with the Bank of England foreseeing 'the worst recession in 300 years'ù. The government 'must take account of the shockwaves the Covid-19 crisis has sent throughout our entire society and the fact that Northern Ireland as a whole is not ready or adequately prepared for the protocol [Brexit arrangements] coming into effect in January'ù, she said. The EU and the UK embarked on the fourth round of talks on Tuesday but few expect any breakthrough with both sides sticking to their rpositions.† Johnson has already made it plain that he will not seek an extension to the transition period by the legal 1 July deadline for such a request, raising the possibility of no deal at the end of the year.† ",0,Neutral
UK fisheries accuse EU of using 'nuclear option' in Brexit talks,0,Neutral,"The UK's fishing industry has accused the EU of using a 'nuclear option'to secure a Brexit deal, warning that it is prepared for blockades by the French if trade talks collapse. Fishing leaders have also revealed they do not support an extension to the transition period despite being hit badly by the coronavirus pandemic, with the closure of restaurants and hotels affecting sales. Barrie Deas, the chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations said the industry is relishing liberation from the common fisheries policy, claiming decades of†injustices, such as French boats being allowed to catch 84% of the quota of cod in the Channel, for instance. Deas claims the EU's 'hardline position'involves zero compromise and 'requires capitulation'by the UK over its demands for a fairer share of the catch from British waters.† Fishing makes up 0.1% of the UK economy but it has found itself at the centre of the trade row because it is so emblematic of Brexit, with communities demanding the government 'takes back control'of British waters. Talks are at a crunch stage, with the EU saying there can be no trade deal without an agreement on fisheries by the end of June to allow fresh quota levels to be set for January next year when the transition period is due to end. 'This is something of a nuclear option '¶ so far, there's no sign of compromise from the member states, particularly the member states that benefit from the current arrangements, and the EU mandate doesn't really provide any scope for compromise, what it requires is capitulation by the UK. My assessment is that that's not very likely - fishing remains an emblematic issue for the government,'said Deas.† His comments came as the fourth round of Brexit talks about trade and the future relationship between the UK and the EU began on Tuesday. In the past week, both sides have lowered their expectations, saying they think it is unlikely the impasse on fisheries and other issues will be broken.† At a press briefing, Deas said the industry did not support an extension to the transition period and that skirmishes between English and French fishing leaders would be almost inevitable.† 'France benefits more than anybody else from relative stability from the current quota shares. If there's any change to that, those quota shares or any other aspect that affects French fishermen, as day follows night there will be blockades, they have done it for much less in the past,'said Deas. He said other countries take 'a much more pragmatic'view and recognise that 'quota shares will have to change'ù. 'There will be a reaction in France by the fishermen, that's just the nature of the beast,'he said but added that that was not a reason 'not to do what we're doing'or to extend the transition period. Two years ago, British and French boats clashed in the Channel in what became known as the 'scallop wars'ù. Elspeth Macdonald, the chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, warned that the French had much to lose if talks break down, with 5,000 jobs in Boulogne dependent on the business. She also pointed out that the fishing industry by value is worth 'about £1bn in each direction'ù. However, this is split by 11 nations, with Ireland, France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and the Netherlands being particularly hit by any reduced access to British waters. Last week, the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he had spoken to 11 fishing ministers and there would be no change to his mandate. ",0,Neutral
"EU has no legal duty to give UK trade privileges, document says",0.375,Positive,"The EU has no legal duty to grant the UK privileges offered to other countries in trade deals, an internal European parliament paper has concluded ahead of a crucial round of Brexit talks this week. The document, drawn up by officials for the parliament's UK coordination group, is a short analysis of arguments made by the UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, in a letter to his counterpart, Michel Barnier. Frost accused the EU of treating the UK as an 'unworthy'negotiating partner by denying the UK 'the kind of well-precedented arrangements commonplace in modern FTAs [free trade agreements]'ù. EU negotiators were deeply irritated by the letter: they countered that every deal is unique and any agreement with the UK must reflect its proximity and potential to become an economic competitor undercutting European rivals. While MEPs are not involved in Brexit negotiations, the latest document, seen by the Guardian, underscores that Barnier enjoys the support of the parliament, which must approve the final UK-EU deal. The EU is 'not legally obliged to grant to UK the rights or trade preferences agreed with other third countries in past FTAs'ù, the document states, adding that the EU is sovereign and has 'the right to propose the commitments that are in its interest'ù. The cementing of positions comes before a critical fourth round of negotiations on the future EU-UK relationship starting on Tuesday. EU and British negotiators will meet via video link because of coronavirus restrictions, with talks scheduled on 11 different topics, including trade in goods and police cooperation. The thorny issue of fishing rights has been allocated the most time, amid fading hopes of an agreement by 1 July, a deadline intended to allow the industry time to prepare for changes from 2021. The two sides will also square off over fair competition conditions to access the EU market, an issue known as the level-playing field that is at the heart of the increasingly bitter dispute. EU officials have accused the UK of backsliding on promises made by Boris Johnson last October, while refusing to engage in detailed talks on the issue. British officials reject these charges, while blaming the EU for holding up progress on an area of mutual benefit. British arguments have failed to convince EU diplomats to rewrite Barnier's mandate, while EU officials have warned of stalemate if this week's talks fail to progress. Another inconclusive round is likely to set up a difficult encounter between Boris Johnson and the head of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in mid June.† The EU is playing down expectations of that meeting, which was once seen as a decisive encounter at the halfway stage of talks. 'No one has the interest at the moment to see this as a make-or-break summit, because we know we won't have enough progress, so we just need to find a common strategy to deal with it,'an EU diplomat said. A UK spokesperson said the government would continue to approach talks constructively. 'We expect this round to keep the process on track ahead of the high-level meeting later this month, but it's clear that the EU needs to evolve its position if we are to reach an agreement. †'A balanced solution is needed which reflects the political realities on both sides, and we will continue to make sure our position is understood,'the spokesperson said, adding that the UK would not agree 'demands for us to give up our rights as an independent state'ù.

Northern Ireland faces 'potent threat' from Brexit and Covid-19,0,Neutral,"Northern Ireland faces a 'potent threat'to its prosperity and stability if reduced business confidence due to uncertainty over post-Brexit trading rules compounds the economic damage from coronavirus, a Lords committee has warned. A fourth round of talks between the UK and EU over a permanent deal begins this week, with little apparent progress made, and the looming deadline of 1 July for the UK to seek an extension to the transition period beyond this year. Boris Johnson has repeatedly ruled this out, while the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has urged the UK to stick to its commitments, saying Brussels will not be pushed into 'agreement at any cost'ù. If no agreement can be reached, the greatest impact could be felt in Northern Ireland, which will follow EU rules on agriculture and manufactured goods, and where there will be some checks on shipments from England, Wales and Scotland. In a report the House of Lords European Union committee said the continued uncertainty could prompt businesses in the rest of the UK to think again about investing in Northern Ireland. 'There is a real danger that businesses based in Great Britain could conclude that it is economically unviable to continue to operate in Northern Ireland, leading in turn to reduced choice and higher costs for Northern Ireland consumers, thus undermining Northern Ireland's economic model, its future prosperity and, potentially, its political stability,'the peers said. Northern Irish businesses have also been hampered in their preparations for the new potential trading regime by the impact of coronavirus, the report said. It concluded: 'The combination of uncertainty, lack of momentum and lack of time, compounded by the shock of the Covid-19 pandemic, is a potent threat to economic prosperity and political stability in Northern Ireland.'Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland's first minister, called on Sunday for any checks on goods entering to be as limited as possible. 'What we have to do now is minimise those checks and make sure that they do not damage the economy of Northern Ireland,'the DUP leader told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show. 'The best way to protect the Belfast agreement and the people of Northern Ireland is to make sure that there are not unnecessary checks and the economy suffers as a result of the Northern Ireland protocol.'The last round of talks saw seemingly minimal progress, with Barnier and his UK counterpart, David Frost, exchanging bad-tempered letters. Frost's letter in particular raised hackles in Brussels by accusing the EU side of treating the UK as an 'unworthy'partner in offering a trade agreement that would force the country to 'bend to EU norms'ù. Speaking to the Sunday Times ahead of the next round, Barnier appeared similarly pugnacious, saying failing to reach a deal would bring 'even more consequences'than before given the coronavirus pandemic. 'So, I think we have a joint responsibility in this very serious crisis, which affects so many families, with so many deaths, so many sick people, so many people unemployed, to do everything we can to reach an agreement and I very much hope that we will do so,'he said.Barnier said Britain had been 'taking a step back - two steps back, three steps back'from the commitments made in the departure deal signed by Boris Johnson. 'The UK negotiators need to be fully in line with what the prime minister signed up to with us,'he said. 'Because 27 heads of state and government and the European parliament do not have a short memory.'",0,Neutral
Brexit talks 'risk stalemate' if no progress on key issues,-0.625,Negative,"Brexit talks risk reaching a stalemate if there is no progress in the next round of negotiations between the European Union and the British government, EU sources have said. The two sides are due to resume talks next week, the final round scheduled before a 'high-level conference'in June to assess progress before the end-of-year deadline. After the chief negotiators, Michel Barnier and David Frost, exchanged testy letters last week, a senior EU official said there was a risk of stalemate if the EU did not see progress on its vital interests, including how to ensure fair competition, or a level play field, between British and EU companies under a free-trade deal. 'That is a crucial round,'the official said. 'If there is no parallel progress - level playing field, protection of fundamental rights and governance - then we risk going into July with a major problem, the stalemate Barnier warned about.'Earlier this month, the EU's chief negotiator said 'parallelism is a condition for progress'ù, meaning that talks had to advance in all areas, including priorities for the EU, such as the level playing field and an agreement on fishing rights. Frost argues the UK has set out a 'comprehensive set of proposals'to prevent unfair competitive advantages, but multiple EU sources say the British ideas are inadequate. In a setback for Frost, EU diplomats have rejected calls for the union to change its approach to the negotiations. One of several diplomats who spoke to the Guardian and were opposed to the idea of rewriting the negotiating mandate, said: 'A large majority of member states, maybe all of us, think that we have to stick to the mandate at this point of time and I don't see a lot of movement '¶ there are not many lights in the tunnel.'In a further blow to the UK, diplomats also backed Barnier's accusation that the British were trying to 'cherrypick'benefits from the EU single market that were not available to other countries with a free-trade agreement, such as Canada and Japan. 'The demands of the UK government at the moment are very unilateral,'said a second EU diplomat. 'They want to keep the things that are suiting them, but give away things in our interest.'The diplomat referred to British interest in an agreement on professional services, such as law and auditing, that goes beyond what the EU has done with other trade partners. 'To have British lawyers providing services around the EU, I am not sure that is of interest to our lawyers, especially when you [the UK] don't want to be in the common ecosystem [of] common controls and rules.'EU diplomats are tired of the repeated reminders from Frost's team about the importance of UK sovereignty, pointing out that their governments are also sovereign. 'The EU accepts that the UK is sovereign, but that is not the issue,'said the EU official. 'The issue is what you as a country are going to commit to to get access to our market. That is the real question.'A UK government spokesperson said it was to be 'expected at this stage in a very difficult negotiation that both sides are making their case robustly and ensuring it is understood. We will continue to approach negotiations constructively, but our position hasn't changed - we won't agree to any EU demands for us to give up our rights as an independent state. 'And we've never asked for anything special, bespoke or unique - we're looking for a free-trade agreement, based on precedent and similar to those the EU has already got with other countries like Canada.'Adding to pressure on Barnier not to concede on fishing rights, on Monday night the European parliament's fisheries committee threatened to veto any deal with the UK that did not include a 'balanced'agreement on fish quotas, allowing EU fleets continue access to British waters. 'No fisheries agreement means no post-Brexit agreement,'said Fran√ßois-Xavier Bellamy, the French centre-right MEP - and member of Barnier's Les RÈpublicains party - who drew up a report that was adopted with near unanimity by the committee.

Outrage at U-turn on promise to reunite child refugees with UK family,0,Neutral,"The Home Office has drawn up plans to terminate the current system of allowing child refugees to be reunited with family in the UK, according to a draft text of the government's Brexit negotiating document. It reveals that the UK government will be pushing during the next round of EU exit talks to effectively end the system where unaccompanied minors, often fleeing conflict, are granted sanctuary in the UK. The negotiating text contradicts the Home Office's previous position which states a 'commitment'to reuniting child refugees with family. In February, Boris Johnson told parliament he wanted to 'discuss cooperation'with the EU on family reunion. On 16 March, Priti Patel's Home Office released a statement promising that Brexit 'should not affect our commitment to continue working together to reunite unaccompanied asylum-seeking children with family and keep them safe'ù. News of the actual negotiating position outraged refugee charities, who warned the proposals would drive vulnerable children into the hands of criminal gangs and people smugglers. Beth Gardiner-Smith of legal charity Safe Passage, an organisation working with unaccompanied child refugees in Europe, said: 'The UK government's planned Brexit agreement would be the end to family reunion from Europe as we know it.'In December, the government provoked public and parliamentary furore when the Brexit bill, defeated in the Lords, watered down legal protections for refugee children. But the UK's draft negotiating document - titled 'working text for an agreement between the UK and EU on the transfer of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children'- goes much further and signals the government's intention to ensure family reunion is no longer a mandatory obligation. Instead, after Brexit it says that an EU country 'may'only request sending an unaccompanied child to the UK with no assurance that the Home Office will act on it. More fundamental is a paragraph that states the UK government wants to stop 'conferring rights'to refugees or give them recourse to the courts, such as legal challenges or a process of appeal, depriving children of their right to have a wrong decision scrutinised by a judge. In effect, the process of accepting child refugees would become entirely discretionary. The most recent year when it was not a mandatory obligation to reunite children with families was 2014 when just eight people, including but not limited to unaccompanied child refugees, were transferred to the UK. By contrast, 1,028 individuals were transferred to the UK under family reunion obligations in 2018, according to Eurostat. On Thursday, it emerged another key Home Office scheme for offering sanctuary to lone minors in Europe had ended, despite thousands of child refugees remaining stranded on the continent. Gardiner-Smith added: 'By diminishing children's chances of reaching their relatives legally, this latest plan would be a blank cheque for people smugglers. This is not what the prime minister recently promised vulnerable refugees. 'We urge the government to think again with its proposal to the EU and deliver an agreement that doesn't risk hundreds of children being denied the ability to reunite with family and left alone in camps.'A petition urging the government to continue family reunion for refugees stands at more than 335,000 signatures. A recent Ipsos Mori online poll of 2,100 people, interviewed between 12 March and 3 April revealed that 79% of people agreed that child refugees should be able to reunite with a parent living in the UK, compared to just 7% who disagreed. A Home Office spokesperson said: 'We have made clear that protecting vulnerable children is a key priority for this government and the progress we have made - with generous support from local authorities - underlines our commitment to that. 'The UK provides a number of legal routes for those seeking protection and we will continue to offer a range of support for those who often need it most.'",0,Neutral
The Guardian view on 'òGlobal Britain': a lonely fiction,-0.375,Negative,"The UK's strategic orientation in the world is rarely the most salient topic of national debate, and it is lost almost entirely in the mostly domestic politics of quarantine. But coronavirus changes the international context in which Britain operates as a power - large by European standards, but not an equal to the US or China. The world into which Boris Johnson thought he would be launching his country on exit from the EU is not the one in which it is now adrift. Borders have closed; trade is disrupted; blame flies between nations and regions. Tension between Washington and Beijing simmers close to boiling. Even before Covid-19, UK foreign policy was warped by delusions of national grandeur. Mr Johnson's plan was for Britain to be a champion of international free trade, thwarting protectionism by the power of its open-market example. These delusions can be seen in the plan for minimal border checks on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Eurosceptics hailed the recovery of Britain's seat at the World Trade Organization as if it were a sovereign crown. In reality, that restoration is no compensation for the loss of a seat at European council summits and the surrender of influence over the regulatory architecture of a continental trade bloc. Whatever the UK can achieve in the WTO will be of second order compared with what it must first negotiate in Brussels and Washington, where it is the smaller, and therefore weaker party. Ministers will never concede that point. Belief in the 'Global Britain'mantra is a requirement for advancement in Mr Johnson's administration. Pragmatic voices seeking alignment with Europe were long ago drowned out. David Frost, Mr Johnson's chief negotiator, takes a maximalist position that sees any accommodation to EU jurisdiction as nullifying sacred principles of Brexit. In that respect, he is more ideologue and politician than diplomat, which makes him ill-suited to the task of brokering a deal. For Eurosceptic hardliners, the priority is a trade deal with Washington, to which end negotiations are under way in parallel with Brexit talks. For the majority of UK businesses, the European side of the equation needs balancing first, since that is where the greater proportion of exports go - around 45%, compared with around 20% to the US. The Atlanticists argue that those proportions describe a status quo from which Brexit is the departure point; what matters is untapped markets. Trade economists query the wisdom of betting everything on benefits that don't exist yet at the expense of those that do. Brexit ultras also think a deal with Donald Trump will put pressure on the Europeans by demonstrating that the UK has options. But Brussels sees Mr Trump's nationalistic trade agenda as a threat to the stability of the international order. That makes concessions on the European side much less likely. And for some Eurosceptics who share Mr Trump's wrecking attitude to the European project, maximum damage to relations with Brussels is a goal in itself. Market access is just one component in this geostrategic contest. Washington wants to dump its agricultural surplus on British consumers (which would ruin domestic farmers), but it also wants the UK to side with Mr Trump in his escalating rhetorical confrontation with China. The EU takes a less belligerent stance towards Beijing. Mr Johnson's China policy is a muddle, warily engaged, but under pressure from many Tories who prefer the US line. Meanwhile, the Covid-19 pandemic has incinerated old expectations and savaged economic prospects for probably years. It introduces stresses to an already fragmented global trading order that were not foreseen by Eurosceptic ideologues. It sharpens dilemmas that were already acute. The lone-trade model forces the UK to compromise on two fronts, in parallel negotiations, with little leverage and no allies. Concessions to the east damage prospects to the west. It is easy to see why the prime minister does not want to admit in public that his choices are constrained, not expanded, by Brexit. But it is a fact to which he must adapt to navigate safely through newly turbulent waters. ",-0.5,Negative
"The 'lockdown sceptics' want a culture war, with experts as the enemy",0,Neutral,"Within days of Boris Johnson announcing lockdown restrictions in late March, Toby Young - self-appointed general secretary of the Free Speech Union - had his own take on the government's tripartite slogan. 'Stay sceptical. End the lockdown. Save lives.'Scepticism has a long and venerable history. From Descartes's musings on metaphysics to Carl Sagan's 'fine art of baloney detection'ù, sceptics are unafraid to ask unpopular questions. Even if it means being branded a heretic. Journalists are inheritors of this fine intellectual tradition. It's our job to call out the self-serving spin of the powerful; to hold them to account. And from massaged Covid-19 testing rates to denialism about the crisis in our care homes, strong reasons for scepticism haven't exactly been in short supply of late. But in the comment sections of some of the rightwing press, a new, virulent strain of Covid-19 scepticism has emerged that is the precise opposite of journalism. Rather than holding power to account, it distorts and bends reality to serve elite interests - and to warp public debate. In the pages of the Daily Telegraph, the Spectator and other outlets, Britain's contemporary 'lockdown sceptics'have dedicated themselves to a singular cause: proving that the UK response to coronavirus has been a massive, hysterical overreaction. 'Lift the lockdown'is their cogito ergo sum; Sweden their promised land. Even as the coronavirus death toll has skyrocketed, the serried ranks of Britain's lockdown sceptics have swelled. What was once largely the preserve of libertarians and professional contrarians now has supporters on the government benches and even, it appears, round the cabinet table. Britain's self-appointed sceptics often look more like US-style culture warriors than critical thinkers. The lockdown - and the scientists advising caution - have become targets of their increasingly frenzied, partisan attacks. Young has been one of the loudest lockdown sceptics - while being across TV and radio stations complaining about how he's been silenced.  A personal brush with coronavirus has only emboldened him. 'Coronavirus has turned us into a nation of scaredy-cats,'he declared in a column published the same day that the UK's official death toll passed 31,500. (Young's Lockdown Sceptics website even carries adverts from solicitors promising to advise anyone who 'might have a legal case or claim over the government's 'òlockdown' regulations'ù.) Young is not alone. Newspaper columnists such as Allison Pearson blithely equate asking schoolchildren to wear face masks with child abuse. Shutting British pubs, meanwhile, is a deprivation of liberty comparable to Communist totalitarianism. Particular ire is reserved for a group of people whose profession is based on scepticism: scientists. The team at Imperial College London - whose modelling predicted as many as half a million coronavirus deaths in Britain without lockdown measures - have been accused of 'crude mathematical guesswork'ù. (By, er, Matt Ridley who presided over the crash at Northern Rock.) When the Telegraph caught Neil Ferguson in breach of lockdown guidance, few were as cock-a-hoop as the paper's columnists. On social media, anti-lockdown outriders presented the professor's misdemeanours as evidence that his work was flawed. Imperial boffins had ruined the economy. It is no surprise that so many professional contrarians are paid-up lockdown sceptics. They are products of our distorted media ecosystem, which invariably privileges heat over light. For them, the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about - even if what you are talking about amounts to social Darwinism. But the lockdown opponents are not just media 'personalities'ù. Many of the Conservatives' most generous donors have called for the economy to be reopened. (Because the views of party funders are, of course, a crucial consideration in a public health emergency.) Politicians have joined the chorus, too. David Davis - who still seems to believe that Brexit Britain will be saved by the political clout of German car manufacturers - has become a convert to the sceptic cause. The former cabinet minister Steve Baker has called on his prime minister to end the 'absurd, dystopian and tyrannical lockdown'ù. Their colleague Daniel Kawczynski would like to see the Welsh Assembly abolished so his constituents can get to the seaside. How long before a British parliamentarian goes full 'plandemic'and wonders aloud if Covid-19 is all a conspiracy? Nadine Dorries, Lucy Allan and Maria Caulfield have already shown a fondness for sharing far-right talking points. Whoever does will doubtless receive far more column inches than the attention-seeking Irish politician, Mattie McGrath, who asked last week if the pandemic was 'a great con'and was roundly ignored in local media, save a savage lampooning. Polls suggest that lockdown scepticism is very much a minority sport, but recent British history shows how quickly fringe views can become mainstream. When the former MEP and prominent Telegraph columnist Daniel Hannan first got on board with Euroscepticism, it was a fringe concern. Now he is one of the guiding lights of Britain's vote to leave the EU - and, as it happens, a vocal lockdown critic, who insouciantly proclaimed in February: 'I'm going to stick my neck out here. You're unlikely to be killed by the coronavirus.'The echoes of Brexit in all this aren't hard to spot. The disavowal of expertise. The pitting of 'the elite'against 'the people'ù. It is striking that while by no means all Brexiters are lockdown sceptics, almost all lockdown sceptics are Brexiters. Having chastised the government for inaction in early March, Nigel Farage now demands a return to liberty for all. On social media, Brexit moneybags Arron Banks's Leave.EU is among the most belligerent anti-lockdown voices. It is easy to dismiss the lockdown sceptics as a rag-tag bunch bound together by instinctive contrarianism, libertarian ideology, vested interests and a fear of a shift towards big state Conservatism. But they have already succeeded in shifting public discourse - far-right activists have been organising anti-lockdown demonstrations in London. We may come to a point where there is almost no 'expertise'that cannot be somehow discredited by this brand of 'scepticism'ù. And given the platform and power many of the people peddling it possess, they can attempt to make anyone look like a hypocrite or a useful idiot, undermining any sense of truth. There is so much to be rightly sceptical about right now. There is indeed plenty wrong with Britain's lockdown. Our government has just given private tech firms 'unprecedented'access to our personal health data. Consultancy giants have been awarded massive contracts for PPE and testing without any open tender process. And how have so many businesses been able to exploit loopholes in lockdown restrictions, forcing low-paid workers to work without adequate safety provision? These are the questions any self-respecting sceptic should be asking. Instead, the 'lockdown sceptics'are hoping to win a narrative battle, to shape what comes next. Britain's success - such as it is - in curtailing deaths will be adduced as proof that the lockdown restrictions were unnecessary. The experts cannot be trusted. The cure was worse than the disease. Carl Sagan would take one look at these contemporary sceptics and declare 'baloney'ù. It is high time we did likewise.

Tories accused of hypocrisy over key workers with immigration bill,0,Neutral,"The shadow home secretary has accused the government of 'rank hypocrisy'for closing the door to low-skilled immigration while cheering NHS workers. As home secretary Priti Patel prepares to bring the immigration bill to the House of Commons for its second reading on Monday, Nick Thomas-Symonds has written to her urging her to 'think again'ù. 'I believe the government's plan to rush through this immigration legislation is an insult to our incredible NHS staff and care workers,'he said. 'It is, frankly, rank hypocrisy from the government towards EU nationals - over 180,000 in England and Wales alone - who are currently working in our NHS and in the care sector, for ministers to stand and clap for them on a Thursday night, and then tell them that they are not welcome in the UK on a Monday.'He suggested the new policy was 'a threat to the national interest'ù. The strongly worded letter is the latest example of a more muscular style of opposition from Keir Starmer's party, after a period of relative quiescence while the coronavirus pandemic was at its peak. Patel described the immigration bill as historic. It brings to fruition the promise of an 'Australian-style points-based system'first outlined by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove when they were fronting the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 referendum. With a Tory majority of 80, the bill should pass easily. 'This historic piece of legislation gives the UK full control of our immigration system for the first time in decades and the power to determine who comes to this country,'Patel said. 'Our new points-based system is firmer, fairer, and simpler. It will attract the people we need to drive our economy forward and lay the foundation for a high wage, high skill, high productivity economy.'And she highlighted the promise of a fast-track NHS visa, saying it would make it easier and quicker for medical professionals to work in the health service. Aside from temporary work visas, such as the one-year version used by many young Britons and others to work in lower-skilled jobs such as agriculture and hospitality, Australia has a strictly capped limit for permanent migration of 160,000. Of these spaces, about a third are intended for those moving for family or humanitarian reasons, with the rest based on skilled migration. There are two types of permanent visa - people who are sponsored by a specific employer, and those who apply independently. Both routes require the applicant to accrue 65 points to move. Points comes from a range of factors, among them: Some critics of the Australian system argue it is a blunt tool, and that the strict points-based criteria can mask other skills and qualities. The cap can also cover a significant backlog in processing people. However the idea of introducing a similar system in the UK post-Brexit has been repeatedly floated by prominent Leave supporters like Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage. Peter Walker, political correspondent Touted by Johnson during last December's general election campaign, the NHS visa promises lower fees and rapid processing for qualified applicants such as overseas doctors who have secured an NHS job offer. However, Thomas-Symonds echoed the charge of his predecessor, Diane Abbott, that the government is continuing to write off lower-paid workers. 'The government is labelling workers - from carers to retail staff, local government workers to refuse collectors - as 'òlow-skilled' when they have been on the front line keeping this country running throughout the crisis,'he said. Full details of the new immigration rules, which will see EU and non-EU migrants treated equally, will not be published until later this year, but are expected to include minimum salary thresholds. The new system will come into force in January, when the status quo transition period is due to come to an end. ",0,Neutral
"Lib Dem election campaign a 'car crash', says party's review",0.125,Positive,"The Liberal Democrat election campaign last year was 'a high-speed car crash'worsened by structural failures, poor tactics, and an inexperienced inner circle around Jo Swinson, an internal party review has concluded. The 61-page report, led by the Lib Dem peer Dorothy Thornhill, says an already hugely difficult campaign was further hampered by errors including hubris over the number of seats the party could win. Despite pre-election predictions from some Lib Dems of gains of 80 or 100 MPs, the 12 December election saw the party slump from its defection-fuelled tally of 21 MPs to just 11, with Swinson among those losing their seats. The report notes that while Swinson was hampered by having less than five months between winning the party leadership and the election, her decision to immediately seek a new party chief executive undermined decision-making structures. 'This had the unintended consequence creating an 'òinner circle' of advisers at arm's length from the resources of the party machine, and put decision-making in the hands of an unaccountable group around the leader,'the report says. 'It also severed some people from the roles and responsibilities they were employed to do, and led to the overpromotion of others.'The report, based in part on almost 21,000 survey responses from Lib Dem members and officials, said Swinson's tactic of promising to revoke Brexit if the party won a parliamentary majority meant the party 'effectively ignored'the biggest group of voters: those who were neither fervently remain or leave. While painting a picture of a party almost drunk on the euphoria of initially high poll ratings and unable to detect that the picture had shifted, the report stresses the role of both a dysfunctional internal structure and what was always going to be a difficult election. 'The overarching conclusion of the review is that had we made much better decisions in 2019, we might have gained a few more seats, but not many more,'it says. The Lib Dems' current interim leader, Ed Davey, praised the report as brave and powerful, saying in a series of tweets that in future the party should be 'rooted in our communities, putting the interest of our communities first, and we need to speak with a clear voice'ù. The report identifies as one key moment the release of a poll before Swinson took over as leader, amid the peak of the Brexit chaos under Theresa May, which put the Lib Dems on 73 seats and within a 5% swing of 219 more. This prompted the abandonment of plans to fight 32 potential new seats as serious targets in favour of a list that rose to 40 and then 80, despite worries from activists about a lack of resources to battle on so many fronts. The expectations swelled towards the party's hugely buoyant autumn conference, and then an election launch at which Swinson was presented as a potential prime minister. This happened, the report noted, despite worrying signs, such as Labour backing a second Brexit referendum. The party, concluded the report, suffered from 'an optimism that was to maintain itself even when the evidence started to turn against it'ù. Before the election was called, the report says, the party faced two unpalatable choices: ally with Labour to stop Brexit, but risk a collapse in tactical voting from Tory voters alarmed by Jeremy Corbyn; or delay an election for as long as possible, even if Brexit took place. 'Instead we chose to claim to believe we could win outright ourselves, thus obviating the need to choose,'it says. 'It is this lack of clarity which led to an election campaign that can only be described as a high-stakes gamble for a once-in-a-lifetime election, to stop Brexit by winning outright. It was a gamble which did not pay off.'The election, which the report summarised as 'a high-speed car crash'ù, was marked by poor on-the-ground campaigning, as exemplified by the loss of Swinson's East Dunbartonshire seat, and a central message that Swinson could be PM which 'appeared unrealistic to the wider public, especially given that we were already falling in the polls'ù.

"The Guardian view on the VE Day anniversary: never again, 2020 style",-0.625,Negative,"The decision to move the early May bank holiday of 2020 to a Friday was taken when Theresa May was prime minister. The primary intention was that the change would enable Britain to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day, 8 May 1945, more extensively. The secondary motive was that the Conservative party has also wanted to get rid of the May Day holiday for ideological reasons ever since it was first introduced in the 1970s. As things have turned out, however, many of the plans for a national VE Day celebration have had to be scrapped or scaled back because of the Covid-19 outbreak. There will still be events to mark the anniversary, as there should be, including another national broadcast by the Queen. But Britain is still in lockdown, the virus is still lethal, and most of us have more pressing issues on our minds right now. Street parties and march-pasts would be inappropriate - though some will still occur. The defeat of Germany in 1945 was without a shadow of doubt a historic event for Britain and its allies. Although the war with Japan was still raging in May 1945, the defeat of Hitler meant that war in Europe would now be replaced by the scarcely less difficult challenges of peace and reconstruction. The evidence of eyewitnesses in 1945, in Britain as elsewhere, is that although rejoicing was wholly justified, the mood was relieved and temperate. Few thought victory was in itself the solution or the end of all problems and difficulties. They were right. The issues in May 1945 were mainly about the future. The national mood was expressed in the words 'never again'ù. Europe lay in ruins for the second time in 30 years. Millions had died on the battlefield and in bombed cities. Europe's Jews had come close to extinction. Russia, which fought the decisive campaign against Hitler, also suffered many more military and civilian deaths than the other victorious allies. America was the decisive and richest victor in the west. The British empire was on its way into history. VE Day should continue to be remembered in the national and international calendar. But it is also right to ask ourselves how long the many anniversaries of the second world war should continue to be marked in the manner that, had it not been for the pandemic, we would have seen again this week. This question should be asked without prejudgment or the wish to provoke or divide. It is a deeply patriotic question for an evolving nation to pose to itself. The era in which Britain defined itself by the war against Hitler has been long and remarkable. But, just like the British empire 75 years ago, that exceptionalist Britain is on its way into history too. Brexit shows it is not going gently. But go it will. Britain, in the best possible way, still needs to get over the war. Were it not for the pandemic, Boris Johnson would have commandeered this holiday to elide the Britain of 1945 with that of Brexit. He would have offered a vision of renewed global greatness, with himself as the new Churchill. He may yet try. But events have made such claims immoral as well as preposterous. This is not a time for rejoicing or false pride. There is no British victory to celebrate today. Instead, there is a Britain whose state institutions were unprepared and insufficiently resilient to minimise the Covid-19 crisis. As in May 1945, the real questions facing Britain are not about the past. They are about the future. ",-0.25,Negative
Conor Burns: the Eurosceptic stalwart who befriended Thatcher,-0.625,Negative,"A self-described 'Catholic unionist'from a Belfast family who took pleasure in singing Irish nationalist ballads, the background of Conor Burns might seem to some at odds with his long-term profile as one of the younger Eurosceptic stalwarts of the Conservative party. Yet the Tory MP, who has resigned as a trade minister, proudly insisted in the past that neither his religion, birthplace nor the fact that he is gay had inhibited his rise through Tory ranks. Another feature of that rise was a friendship with the late Margaret Thatcher, whom he reportedly met in 1997 after driving her husband, Denis, back from a golf outing. 'DT insisted that I come in 'òand meet the boss','Burns later recalled. The former prime minister would go on to support a number of attempts by Burns to enter parliament, including when she defied doctor's orders to make a rare public address to launch the activist's ill-fated attempt to become the Tory MP for Eastleigh in 2001. A former chairman of Southampton University Conservative Association, Burns was backed by Norman Tebbit to be the party's student director and also worked for another noted Eurosceptic, Bill Cash. Other roles came at DeHavilland, the political and public affairs company, in finance with Zurich Advice Network and as a vice-president of the Young Britons' Foundation, an organisation, since closed, which was dubbed 'the Conservative madrasa'because of its radical views. His Westminster breakthrough came in 2010 when he was elected as MP for Bournemouth West, and he went on to serve as parliamentary private secretary to five different ministers, including under Johnson when he was foreign secretary. During that time, Burns claimed that his Twitter account was hacked after tweets were sent to the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, demanding details of the UK's payment obligations to Brussels. Burns followed Johnson out the door when the latter resigned from his ministerial post in 2018 amid opposition to the Brexit plans of the then prime minister, Theresa May. Burns's loyalty was rewarded when Johnson became prime minister, and he was appointed minister of state for trade policy in July 2019. The role gave him responsibilities for policy on areas including trade agreements, barriers to markets and international education exports. Previous roles have also included a stint as chairman of the all-party group on Bahrain, during which time he defended the kingdom's record on human rights and urged Britain not to turn its back on it.

We forget that flu once plagued the economy as coronavirus does today,0,Neutral,"It is a sobering thought that, according to the many well-researched accounts to have appeared in recent weeks, this Johnson/Cummings government seems to have been prepared to risk 250,000 deaths from the policy of 'herd immunity'ù. This approach was, mercifully, laid to rest after the intervention of Professor Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, on 16 March. There followed the introduction of lockdown and what some of us prefer to call 'physical distancing.'Commentators have been putting the 27,000 or more deaths in this country attributed to the virus so far in the context of the 60,000 civilian deaths recorded during the second world war. This is bad enough. But I wonder how many people are aware that during the 'Spanish'flu epidemic of 1918-21, which followed the first world war, the estimated loss of life in this country was, well, 250,000? In passing, I think it is worth mentioning that, until the onset of the coronavirus plague, the impact of Spanish flu in this country had hardly seemed to dawn on the consciousness of subsequent generations. The first world war itself? Yes. The Great Depression? Of course. Spanish flu? Wasn't that something that occurred in Latin America - Love in the Time of Cholera? In drawing attention to the parallels between the economic consequences of Spanish flu and coronavirus, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research has performed a great service. In its May Economic Review, it calculates that output (gross domestic product) will fall by anything between 15% and 25% in this April-June quarter, as a result of the painfully obvious impact of the lockdown on economic activity we see all around us. This compares with a 12-15% fall in the second quarter of 1921. But in 1921, output recovered by a similar magnitude - 12-15% - in the third quarter, and the NIESR is assuming that, as things ease up, a recovery in the second half of this year might mean that the actual reduction of GDP this year could be some 8% - still unnerving. However, the drop could have been 10% without the alleviation afforded by the furlough and other measures wisely unveiled by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the Bank of England. Even so, unemployment is expected to soar to 10% by the end of this year, and there is already much hardship being suffered by innocent victims of the lockdown, or clampdown, on the economy. Whichever way you look at it, this is a calamity. Which makes it all the more reprehensible that one of the first announcements the prime minister made after his return was that there was no way he would extend the timetable for our complete withdrawal from the EU, come what may. Well, a lot of it has come already. The International Monetary Fund calculates a no-deal Brexit - which is what Johnson and Cummings are heading for - would add a further, permanent loss of 5% to the UK's GDP, on top of the permanent damage from the virus, which the NIESR puts at £800bn, or some 10% of GDP. Citizens and businesses all over Europe are riven with uncertainty about the impact of Brexit. I am well aware that these macroeconomic references to GDP mean little to average members of the public. But they should. One of the reasons why the NHS was so ill-prepared for the catastrophe - which is not to underestimate the heroic efforts doctors and nurses have been making since it struck - is that the NHS required a 4% increase in spending per annum after 2010 merely to cope with the cost of new technology and the ageing population; but it was granted a miserable 1% a year by Austerity Osborne. People now hope that Johnson, having recovered from his near-death experience, means what he says about the value of the NHS. My good friend the historian Lord Hennessy, ever generous of spirit, spoke on the BBC of a 'new Boris'ù. I wonder. His former boss at the Telegraph, Sir Max Hastings, says: 'He is a far more ruthless, and frankly nastier, figure than the public appreciates. I would not take Boris's word about whether it is Monday or Tuesday.'He has sacked decent people in his cabinet and packed it with rightwing Brexiters. In which context, I shall watch the progress of the relatively new chancellor with interest. He is doing his best to do the right, Keynesian thing with the economy, and has realised the importance of the state, having clearly listened to his Treasury advisers. The latter are not natural spenders, but know a calamity when they see one. They also know, or ought to, that concerns about heavy borrowing are overdone when there is a counterpart of increased savings from a public whose spending opportunities are limited by the clampdown. Sunak should now also ask his Treasury officials whether he should reconsider his support for Johnson and Cummings over Brexit. ",0,Neutral
The Observer view on the danger posed by Brexit during our greatest vulnerability,-0.75,Negative,"For months, Boris Johnson and his band of hard Tory Brexiters talked of virtually nothing else. It was as though the moment on 31 January when Britain left the EU was the only thing in the world that mattered. It marked, for them, the climax of an opportunistic project that shook up Europe's political landscape, brought a big election victory and confirmed Johnson's ascendancy. It is now painfully clear, as the government struggles to defeat the Covid-19 pandemic, that Britain is paying a heavy price for the Brexit distraction in the early weeks of 2020. Johnson and senior ministers were simply not paying sufficient attention as the virus rapidly migrated from China to these shores. This assertion is officially denied, of course. To admit otherwise would be a resignation matter. But there is good reason to believe Johnson et al were more concerned with whether Big Ben's bongs would welcome Brexit's dawn than with ensuring Britain's health and social services were prepared and equipped to deal with the looming emergency. Brexit continues to be an unwelcome, unnecessary and damaging distraction today. Many, including this newspaper, believe it always was. The difference now is those same Tory Brexiters who could barely contain their glee in January do not want to discuss it either. Even for them, Brexit has become a problematic embarrassment. It's not hard to discern why. What sane government, at this time of unprecedented economic, financial, social and human distress, would deliberately risk further, massive disruption to vital trade, business, investment and security lifelines? Yet thanks to the Brexiters, this second catastrophe - a calamity of choice - is racing towards us like a runaway train loaded with explosives. Talks in Brussels, postponed due to the virus, resumed last week with a bald statement by David Frost, the lead UK negotiator, that Britain would not seek to extend the transition period that ends on 31 December. What that means in reality is that, absent an act of divine intervention or last-minute climbdown, Britain is getting set to jump off a no-deal cliff at its moment of greatest vulnerability. Uncomfortable fact 1: There is limited capacity and even less inclination among EU leaders to divert effort and resources, amid an extraordinary crisis, into a rushed negotiation, just to suit Johnson's artificial timetable, as Michel Barnier made clear on Friday. The Germans, who will hold the EU council presidency from July, have already indicated as much. Berlin's focus, rightly, will be on Europe's reconstruction, not Britain's self-destruction. Uncomfortable fact 2: Britain's negotiating positions are inflexible to the point of obtuseness. Barnier singled out fisheries. But there are deep differences across the board. The EU's chief negotiator complained Britain was dragging its feet, pointing out that doing so made the December deadline even less practical. The very real possibility that Johnson actually has no coherent plan at all does not appear to have occurred to Barnier. He should consider it. Uncomfortable fact 3: a no-deal crash looms large because there is almost certainly not enough time to achieve the most rudimentary, bare-bones free trade agreement, if one were on offer, or even to fully implement last year's withdrawal agreement. Any transition extension must be agreed by 30 June. After that, in EU and British law, there is no going back. The chasm beckons. This is not a policy - it is a charlatan's farce. These are not the acts of responsible, sensible political leaders. Brexit was always a largely delusional, dishonest project. Now it is entering the realms of fantasy and nightmare. By persisting as though nothing has changed, Johnson, Dominic Raab and the rest risk untold additional damage to a country already desperately struggling to survive the pandemic. Given the disaster that has befallen us all, the only rational course is to swiftly apply for a Brexit extension of at least one year and preferably two, agree additional budget contributions and actively cooperate with the EU on measures to rebuild a pan-European economy that remains vital for UK prosperity. It's plain, despite the denials, that Brexiters' disdain for such cooperation lay behind the lethal failure to join an EU purchasing scheme for protective clothing and ventilators. It is also of great concern that Johnson's hard Brexit guru, Dominic Cummings, is attending meetings of the government's scientific advisory group, Sage. His presence undoubtedly pollutes discussions that are supposedly strictly non-political. Here is further evidence of Brexit blight. There are hints in Whitehall that more grounded Tories understand that continued intransigence over an extension cannot be sustained. It should be evident to even the most ideologically obsessed that taking back control cannot mean kicking away yet more human, economic and social props as the national edifice trembles and people suffer and die. This is plain common sense. Johnson must decide and quickly. Once he re-enters politics after his illness, he should level with the country. Even though he doesn't want to, Johnson needs to talk about Brexit - and why the current timetable must change. Brexit isn't done. ",-1.125,Negative
Covid-19 lockdown exit strategy - how to find the safest path,0.125,Positive,"Your article on planning for a strategy to exit from lockdown (UK government has no exit plan for Covid-19 lockdown, say sources, 15 April) was highly significant, particularly in highlighting the reluctance of ministers to respond to growing calls for their thinking on any potential strategies to be published. Despite their efforts to rewrite history, evidence from meetings of the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) and the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group (Nervtag) all the way up to mid-March shows clearly that the scientific evidence was, at various times, either confused or delivered to ministers with insufficient clarity. As a result those ministers then made fundamental mistakes, which meant we lost valuable time to prepare for the epidemic, in particular by locking down the country much earlier. To make matters worse, the decision announced on 12 March to abandon community testing and tracing, almost certainly because we no longer had sufficient capacity to do it, has undoubtedly cost a huge number of lives in the UK. Nearly 14,000 have died so far, compared with under 4,000 in Germany - a larger country than us, but one that never stopped testing and tracing. The reality now is that we don't even know who all the people are who are advising the government, let alone what advice they are giving. That advice needs to be published so that all of us, and especially parliament, can interrogate it to ensure that it is robust and that important factors have not been overlooked. Lobby journalists have done their best, but we have to hope that the return of parliament will mean that the government and its advisers are made to be a good deal more accountable than they are required to be in their daily press briefings.Chris DunneLondon '¢ The suggestion that we should repeatedly flip-flop between lockdown and relaxation (Coronavirus distancing may need to continue until 2022, say experts, 14 April) is dangerous nonsense. Denmark and Greece, among others, have shown what must be done. Lock down fast, hard, long, and once and for all. Wait until new coronavirus cases have fallen to a trickle. Only then let everyone go back to work and socialise, when there is very little virus left to spread. With the economy finally back to firing on all cylinders, keep the virus in check with rigorous testing, tracking, isolation and border control. Our government failed its first test. Its second test will be to resist pressures to lift lockdown too early.David AllenKinoulton, Nottinghamshire '¢ This government is obsessed with drawing parallels between Covid-19 and the second world war. Odd, therefore, that ministers can't see that in claiming it's too early for an exit strategy, they are aligning with those short-sighted strategists who said the Beveridge report on rebuilding and improving health and social services would be a distraction. It wasn't. It was an inspiration.Dr Colin J SmithWest Kirby, Wirral '¢ In 1945, the allied powers showed they could contemplate the future even during the darkest days of the war.

"After coronavirus, Boris Johnson's Tories will be a very different party",0.625,Positive,"It is only four months since Boris Johnson led the Conservative party to a historic victory. His 80-seat majority seemed to recast the electoral landscape for a generation. It also marked another milestone in Brexit's transformation of the Conservative party from the party of business to the party of the flag. Today, that seems like another world. Everything has been upended by Covid-19. The business of government is wholly taken up with protecting public health, keeping the economy on life support and, in Johnson's own case, his personal survival. Today the national lockdown is expected to be extended into May.  It seems likely that the Britain which eventually emerges from the coronavirus crisis will be a country of a significantly different temper from the Britain that went into it. Nobody can be certain about the degree of change. The possibility that the economy may shrink by a third, with millions of job losses, is a reality check about a more enduringly difficult new normal. The post-pandemic Conservative party must adapt too. But in what ways? Future British politics will not shake down into a binary choice between the economy and public health. The need to restore both will be far messier than that. Political horizons will simultaneously be very wide - global issues of health, supply chains, travel, information and Chinese power will surge up the agenda - and very narrow: local issues about safe ways to work, earn, live and survive a future pandemic will matter more too. Politics will be more fragile, fearful and dynamic. While the pandemic and the lockdown hold sway, the official Conservative position is to ensure the least bad of all possibilities. The policy can be summed up by Rishi Sunak's comments this week. 'The single most important thing we can do for the health of our economy is to protect the health of our people,'said the chancellor on Tuesday. 'It's not a case of choosing between the economy and public health.'However, once discussion moves on to the so-called exit strategy and to the post-Covid future, as it is now beginning to do, this begins to change. The choices do not suddenly become absolute. Instead they become competing calculations of the balance of risk in the interaction between the economy and public health, as and when the pandemic wanes. That has to be one of the reasons why Keir Starmer is pressing the government to publish its strategy. He knows this will reveal faultlines and compromises that an opposition can exploit without appearing partisan or unpatriotic. There are some signs of those tensions already appearing within Conservative ranks. Sajid Javid, Sunak's more fiscally cautious predecessor, warned this week against mortgaging the future, and said low taxes remained key to kickstarting the economic recovery. Theresa May and several of her ex-ministers, including Philip Hammond, believe something similar. But Johnson will want to go on spending, not reinventing austerity. So will the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who will press for a large programme of resilience measures in health and social care to guard against a future pandemic. The new Tory MPs from the former industrial areas will agree with them. So, at least for now, will Sunak. Where this process of change will eventually lead the Tory party is difficult to predict. Sunak's autumn budget - in which the social care agenda that was abandoned in 2017 will surely have to be a central focus - looms increasingly as a vital moment. But all this will surely generate a rather different party, and with rather different priorities, from the one that Johnson led to victory last December. Whether the Tory party successfully embraces the choices that will now face it depends overwhelmingly on Johnson himself. After 2019, the party is unusually dependent on the man at the top. The reshuffled cabinet consists mainly of minister of state-level players whom Johnson dominates from No 10. Its lack of depth has been cruelly exposed in the crisis. The party remains very much Johnson's own brand, held together by his inimitable personality and popularity. For as long as Johnson remains out of action, the important choices about the party's direction are likely to be deferred. The party which, only a few weeks ago, Johnson and Dominic Cummings were building on the basis of Brexit and the anger of the left-behind is becoming less relevant by the day in the shadow of coronavirus. The dissonance between the new realities and the recent past is now huge. Instead of the old contempt towards experts, competence and seriousness, there is now a craving for all three to help steer a safe course through the Covid-19 crisis. The idea that the government's post-pandemic priorities might include lighting fires under the BBC, the civil service and the universities therefore seems even more destructive now than before. The idea that Britain should be a Brexit buccaneer, turning its back resolutely against Europe and throwing itself into the arms of Donald Trump seems even more irresponsible. As one former minister put it to me this week: 'The party that was being created in the wake of the election was a new one. It was based on a cultural backlash against liberalism and established elites at home and abroad. But that doesn't feel to me like what the country wants now. It doesn't want divisive politics. It doesn't want a culture war. This feels like a moment to step away from a lot of that.'Whether to take that step away will be very much Johnson's own decision. But it is a decision with momentous implications for the Tory party and for the whole of British party politics. '¢ Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist ",0.125,Positive
Brexit: coronavirus sparks calls to extend EU transition period,0,Neutral,"Britain and the EU are facing calls to back away from a 'game of chicken'and extend the Brexit transition period immediately, as both respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Boris Johnson, however, has insisted there will be no change to the transition period - during which the UK follows EU regulations, including its free movement laws. It is scheduled to finish at the end of the year. However, with parts of Europe in lockdown and the UK government expecting the peak of the crisis in Britain in late spring and early summer, some experts are calling for immediate agreement to delay. There are concerns that the peak of the disease in the UK could coincide with critical negotiation deadlines. June is the final month for Britain to ask for an extension beyond this year. Trade expert David Henig is among those calling for a rethink. 'I don't see how you can realistically, by the end of June, make a decision on how trade talks are going,'he said. 'You would be doing it with a lot of people under pressure, dealing with something that really is an arbitrary deadline. This is the classic force majeure cause - an unforeseen circumstance of the extreme degree. 'This should apply to both sides. The Italians are practically completely in lockdown. They have stopped having all but essential meetings in Brussels. It's a bit of a game of chicken, with neither side wanting to say they can't cope with it. An extension could be offered on whatever strict terms.'He also warned the EU that there were signs that its response to the latest round of talks was not as effective as its approach to Britain's EU divorce deal, finally voted through parliament earlier this year. 'The commission are going through the 'òdifficult second album' phase this time round,'he said. 'Last time, they were undoubtedly the grown-ups in the room. It's less clear that that applies this time.'Matthew O'Toole, a former adviser to Theresa May who is now an SDLP politician in Northern Ireland's assembly, agreed. 'Right now, I'm loth to even mention Brexit,'he tweeted. 'But, as of today, the UK government is still ruling out extending transition. That is lunatic. The world will soon be recovering from a huge economic shock. No one - not the EU or even Trump's US - will have time for Brexiter fantasies.'Face-to-face talks, due this week in London, have already been cancelled amid the crisis. Other methods of remote communication are being used. Initial plans suggested there would be five rounds of talks by mid-May, before a crucial summit in June. ",0,Neutral
The next Labour leader must hold the Tories to account over Brexit,0,Neutral,"It is apt that voting in the Labour leadership contest has coincided with the start of Brexit trade negotiations. Both, inextricably, will determine when - or if - we see another Labour government. Like every other task for the party's next leader, devising a policy on Brexit feels dangerous, and potentially unrewarding. Labour could widely misjudge the public mood, or appear to be in denial that it lost, or even look like a party of remain that wants to frustrate the process altogether. So here is the most important thing: Labour must abandon that fear, and fast. We have left the EU and there is no current movement to rejoin. Labour must reassure leavers of that at every opportunity. Remainers will not hold it against them. Indeed, leavers and remainers can unite on at least one point: everyone expects the opposition to carry out its basic function of challenging the government. It is irrelevant whether the new leader wanted Brexit. Brexit has happened. That may be devastating, but it brings certainty - and it is this which opens up the political terrain for Labour to act with confidence where before it could only triangulate. In effect, the new leader must advocate what many remainers were proposing for two years after the referendum: the compromise position of a soft Brexit in the single market and customs union, or the maximum harmonisation that comes just short of it. That will preserve the frictionless trade with our largest partner and still allow bilateral deals with other countries across a range of sectors. It will also keep the Irish Sea free of intra-UK goods checks. Leaving the EU does not require us to give up on our economy. We cannot wind the clock back to 1973, and should not want to even if we could. Labour needs to champion its pro-European, pro-worker credentials and communicate that they are one and the same. As the government gaslights us ever closer to the no-deal catastrophe it brands 'an Australia outcome'ù, Labour must remind voters that the leave campaign insisted we would be part of a 'European free trade zone from Iceland'- in the single market - 'to the Russian border'ù. Only Labour would deliver the Brexit people were promised. The government's lurch to the extremes is actually making Labour's job easier. Ministers disregard the wishes of business, the demands of our globalised economy and the needs of ordinary workers. The old promises of the 'exact same benefits'ù, reduced red tape and increased prosperity stand out in our present reality like relics from a lost civilisation. The government is out of control; Labour can wrest it back from them. The real risk for Labour is that it learns the wrong lessons from its general election drubbing. First, the promise of a second referendum did not cause the defeat. Both remainers and leavers had abandoned the party before that policy - and it was only the promise of a referendum that brought remainers back. Second, the majority in December did not want to 'get Brexit done'ù. Over 52% of voters backed parties in favour of either a second referendum or remaining outright. British politics now offers a wide, fertile space for a party that seeks to appeal both to remainers and soft leavers. If Labour does not occupy it, its opponents on the left and centre will. Once again, Labour will be squeezed on both sides of the country's new divide and win the support of neither. But the issue is even more fundamental than that. Although Brexiters have successfully recast democratic opposition as opposition to democracy, the general public does not, as a rule, expect a losing party to abandon its principles or merge with the winners. Labour can never and will never out-Brexit the Tories. If voters want economic and xenophobic nationalism in 2024, they will vote for the real thing, not an ersatz version masked by a red rosette. Labour's opposition must not just be rooted in strong principle, but basic politics. If Brexit goes wrong - which the evidence suggests it will - then an opposition that has meekly acquiesced to it will share the blame. This is Labour's chance to show itself as the party of moderation and maturity. For years, and to devastating effect, the Tories have charged their opponents with economic incompetence and recklessness. That attack may ring more hollow once Boris Johnson has driven the economy over a cliff - but Labour must demonstrate its economic rationality beforehand. When it comes to it, Brexit is existential for Labour. The government is refusing to defend our key supply chains, refusing to defend the services sector, refusing to defend car manufacturers, scientists or farmers. The Tories said they cared about our prosperity, but have shown they do not. Labour must. This party exists to defend not delusions of empire or fantasies about sovereignty, but real jobs, real industries and real communities.

Keir Starmer declines to rule out campaigning to rejoin EU,0.25,Positive,"Keir Starmer, the Labour leadership frontrunner, has declined to rule out campaigning to rejoin the EU in the years ahead, saying it was a question for future generations. The shadow Brexit secretary said he did not think it was a 'priority for now and the immediate future'and has previously said the question of leaving the EU is over. But when pressed to rule out advocating rejoining the EU in future, he said: 'It's for our kids to decide what our future relationship is.'Starmer was the only candidate not to rule out campaigning to reverse Brexit at a Labour hustings hosted by the Mirror in Dudley. Rebecca Long-Bailey was the candidate who posed the question to her two leadership rivals and she ruled it out herself. Lisa Nandy said: 'I'd rule it out.

Quitting EU Erasmus scheme would 'blow a hole' in UK economy,0,Neutral,"Quitting the EU's Erasmus student exchange programme would 'blow a hole'in the UK's economy, taking away income of £243m a year and depriving 17,000 British young people of valuable work experience, according to a group of education and business leaders. The group, including further education colleges and universities, is calling for the British government to make clear that continued Erasmus membership is a high priority in its talks with the EU. Britain's membership of the EU-wide exchange scheme known as Erasmus+ is to expire at the end of this year, alongside membership of the EU. The government's negotiating outline offered scant hope of continued full membership, saying only that it 'will consider options for participation in elements of Erasmus+ on a time-limited basis, provided the terms are in the UK's interests'ù. Universities UK International (UUKI), the umbrella group representing higher education providers, said membership of Erasmus gave a bonus to the British economy worth £243m a year, after subtracting membership costs from the £420m generated by EU students visiting the UK under the programme. It also said the 17,000 British students and young people who use Erasmus for work placements and study would also lose out, particularly students from disadvantaged backgrounds who would struggle to fund their travel and expenses without it. Joe Fitzsimons, the head of education and skills policy at the Institute of Directors, said: 'Many employers deeply value the kind of international experience the Erasmus scheme helps foster. Given the benefits it can bring students and businesses, maintaining access to Erasmus and wider EU research and education partnerships has been a priority for the IoD from the off.'Emma Meredith, international director at the Association of Colleges (AoC), representing further education, said its data showed 85% of colleges were using Erasmus+ to find work placements that were not available with local employers, particularly for students in vocational subjects such as construction and social care. 'For college students in some of the most deprived parts of the country, Erasmus+ helps to level up opportunity, experience and aspiration as well as ensuring that we are viewed as an open, tolerant and welcoming country to the rest of the world,'she said. An AoC survey found more than 90% of colleges would be unable to fund work placements for further education students if Erasmus is not extended or replaced. The director of UUKI, Vivienne Stern, said: 'We know that disadvantaged and disabled students have the most to gain from an international experience. They will be the students who will lose the most if Erasmus+ falls by the wayside. 'Yet I am worried that government isn't committed to keeping the UK in Erasmus. Now is the time to commit to this unique programme that boosts not only students' prospects, but those of businesses and the economy.'The Department for Education has previously said the government 'is committed to continuing the academic relationship between the UK and the EU, including through the next Erasmus+ programme if it is in our interests to do so'ù. The UK's post-Brexit membership of Erasmus is likely to hinge on the EU's stance on the cost of continuing membership, and whether the EU ties it to another top priority: continued access for UK universities to the EU's Horizon 2020 research programme, which is worth billions of euros. Losing access to either the Horizon or Erasmus programmes would be a further blow for universities struggling with student recruitment difficulties, including potentially huge losses in international tuition fees caused by the coronavirus disruption. A new report by the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) also suggests that the UK government will struggle to meet its targets for national research spending if universities suffer cuts to domestic or international fee income. 'If the UK university sector is to continue thriving, then it is crucial that the chancellor recognises the interdependencies between teaching and research in the budget and subsequent spending review,'said Nick Hillman, the HEPI's director and the author of the report. 'Universities roughly break even on teaching home students but make a big loss on research. They fill in part of that gap from the surplus on teaching international students. But they now face a looming large loss on teaching home students, for example because of tweaks to tuition fees in England. If that happens, they will have to use international student fees to subsidise home students and there will be less money for covering gaps in research funding.'",0,Neutral
The Observer view on dropping the UK's commitment to human rights law,0.625,Positive,"To doubts that the government can be trusted to honour promises to maintain post-Brexit workplace, environmental and food standards must now be added very real concerns about its continued adherence to international human rights law - meaning, specifically, the European convention on human rights. Such prospective backsliding is foolish, damaging and wholly unacceptable. The issue came to the fore last week after Michel Barnier, the EU chief negotiator, revealed that the UK 'informs us that they do not wish to commit formally to applying the ECHR'ù. Downing Street later claimed that the government continued to support the treaty, which the UK joined in 1951, but did not want its membership to form a legally binding part of a future EU-UK trade agreement. This sounds like splitting hairs. But it is much more than that. The linking of trade agreements to human rights has become normal practice in recent years. As Barnier suggested, the ECHR provides essential legal underpinning in a range of areas. He highlighted cooperation in criminal justice and law enforcement, which, he said, 'requires commitment on both sides with respect to fundamental rights of persons'ù. A UK refusal to guarantee future adherence to the treaty could have a potentially serious negative impact on the Good Friday agreement, to which it is integral. Security cooperation might also be affected, likewise arrangements regarding privacy and the safeguarding of personal data. Barnier warned, rightly, that the British position, if maintained, will severely handicap and limit the scope of the future EU-UK relationship. What is Boris Johnson playing at? Or perhaps this question should be directed at Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, who is on record as wanting rid of the ECHR altogether. Rightwing Tories have long disparaged the treaty and the 1998 Human Rights Act that translated it into British law, seeing them as tools employed by scheming Brussels bureaucrats to extend control over British life. This has always been an absurd argument. The ECHR, and its associated court in Strasbourg, came into being long before the modern-day EU, and is entirely separate from it. It is the creation of the 47-country Council of Europe that Winston Churchill, Johnson's hero, helped found. In 1948, Churchill called for a 'charter of human rights guarded by freedom and sustained by law'ù. The ECHR is, in fact, an achievement of which Britain should be particularly proud. Reacting to the horrors of the Second World War, the treaty aimed to ensure that governments would never again be allowed to abuse ordinary people with impunity. Its development helped inform the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. British experts helped draft it. The UK was first to ratify it. And it has been hugely influential in setting or raising standards in Europe and around the world. Despite his insistence that Britain will remain a signatory, Johnson's refusal to fully commit to abiding by the ECHR in EU negotiations strongly suggests that he may seek, in future, to abrogate it (and the HRA) entirely - as ideologues such as Cummings demand. This would do huge damage to Britain's standing in the world and its hard-won reputation as a leading advocate for global human rights. More than that, it represents a fundamental threat to the rights of British people, who, unlike in many democracies, are not protected by written constitutional guarantees or a modern bill of rights. If the UK abandoned the ECHR, it would join Belarus, an authoritarian dictatorship that is the only country in Europe not a party to it. Even Vladimir Putin's Russia has been a member since 1998. With international laws and institutions such as the international criminal court being vandalised and undermined by autocrats and demagogues such as Donald Trump, this is not the time to start messing with British citizens' basic legal protections. Johnson and Cummings must be told: keep your hands off our rights. ",0.25,Positive
Brexit 'opportunity to ban supertrawlers from UK waters',0.5,Positive,"Brexit offers the perfect opportunity to ban industrial supertrawler fishing boats from UK waters, according to campaigners. The factory-sized ships can be hundreds of feet long and have been criticised for indiscriminate fishing as they catch hundreds of thousands of fish in relatively short periods. Environmentalists fear their presence correlates with spikes in numbers of dolphins washing up dead. Use of the ships is heavily regulated in some countries, as trawling has been criticised for the physical damage it inflicts on seabeds, but under the common fisheries policy, EU-registered vessels are legally entitled to fish in UK waters, subject to licence conditions, quota allocation and relevant fishing restrictions. Campaigners fear supertrawlers are incompatible with sustainable management of fisheries and argue that the UK's departure from the EU presents an opportunity for a new approach, as fishing rights to British waters are up for review. 'Our government likes to boast about its credentials as a global oceans champion, but what about protecting our seas here at home?'said Chris Thorne, Greenpeace's oceans campaigner. 'Ministers should take a long, hard look at whether allowing supertrawlers to operate in UK waters is compatible with sustainable management of our waters, as well as investigating the impact of the UK's industrial distant-water fleet in other countries' waters.'Calls for a ban on supertrawlers were made last year when the Lithuanian-registered Margiris - a 142-metre (465ft) boat with a deadweight of 6,200 tonnes, once considered the second largest in the world and banned from Australian waters - spent time off the south coast of England. According to analysis by Greenpeace, Margiris was fishing in an area of the Channel designated by the government as a marine conservation zone. However, the government said it was monitored closely and no infringements were found. The overall number of voyages in UK waters by supertrawlers each year is unclear, but conservationists claim that anecdotal evidence suggests the ships wreak havoc on sea life. 'It's just been a long stream of dolphin deaths, I have never seen anything quite like it,'said John Hourston, from the Blue Planet Society. 'We have had several storms but dolphins do not die because of weather, they are great swimmers.'He believes the evidence points to supertrawlers being responsible for an increase in stranded dolphins off the Sussex coast and the west of Ireland, but that scientific study is needed to incontrovertibly prove the link.  'We have just got mass dolphin die-offs and mass fishing fleets and the two correlate, but we need more evidence.'At the very least, he said, these ships should fitted with CCTV cameras or have independent observers on board to monitor which fish are being caught. 'I am not talking about the inshore fishermen, I am talking about the industrial supertrawler fleets,'he said. 'We should not be allowing supertrawlers in British waters.'French campaigners have also highlighted how rising numbers of dead dolphins are being washed up on the coast of the Bay of Biscay after becoming caught up in large trawler nets. In 2017, researchers said the number of dead dolphins washing up on British and French shores was at its highest level in more than 14 years, echoing observations from Ireland.  The website of fishing company Parlevliet & Van der Plas, the owner of the Margiris, says it has an 'excellent reputation for sustainable fishing'ù. It added: 'Our catch quotas are dictated by government and EU regulations, and are based on scientific advice. We fish without causing damage to the seabed, and without disturbing the ecological system.'A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: 'As an independent coastal state, we will have the right to decide who fishes in our waters and on what terms. 'This means we can design our own domestic fishing policy, one that supports our coastal communities and lets the UK lead the way on sustainable fishing.''¢ This article was amended on 9 March 2020 to remove a reference to the Hull-based Kirkella because the trawler does not operate in UK waters.

The Priti Patel allegations are turning into a #MeToo moment for the civil service,0.125,Positive,"You're not really supposed to know who we are - the unelected bureaucrats of the UK. That's how it's worked since time immemorial - civil servants are supposed to silently get on with it while ministers take the flak. And that's how we like it. But this very British convention of public life - like so many others - has been dangerously weakened by Brexit and is now being shredded by an emboldened administration still flexing its muscular majority. It's now not even controversial that Philip Rutnam is merely one of several senior civil servants on Dominic Cummings's 'shitlist'ù. I'm half hoping that Hilary Mantel - who's already shown she can bring the stories of the most heartless, heretic-torturing government enforcers to life - will one day take on this chapter of history. But until then, it's difficult to properly describe just how shocked we were by the Home Office permanent secretary's extraordinary on-camera resignation and characterisation of the home secretary as a liar and architect of an alleged 'vicious and orchestrated campaign'against him. Sure, we've seen increasing coverage of the defenestrations of other top civil servants such as Ivan Rogers in Brussels, Kim Darroch in Washington, and the UK borders chief Karen Wheeler. But this is a watershed moment even in a hostile environment that threatens a deluge of them. More colleagues are now coming forward with further allegations against Patel during her time as an employment minister in 2015. That's in addition to claims that she, as international development secretary, openly called her staff 'fucking useless'ù. This prompted the Department for International Development's permanent secretary, Matthew Rycroft, to tell his staff: 'Our management board has decided to take further action to address bullying, harassment and discrimination in DfID. The recent people survey highlighted that we have more to do.''More to do'might be an understatement. The survey Rycroft mentions is a questionnaire that most of the 400,000-strong civil service take part in every year, and which includes questions on the extent of bullying and harassment we experience. The 2018 edition revealed significant problems. So it might not be a stretch to say that this feels like a sort of #MeToo moment for the civil service. Those who, like me, have been around government for several years reckon more allegations are on the way. There may be blood. It probably won't be Patel's. For now, an investigation has been promised into whether she has broken the ministerial code, but swift endorsements from Michael Gove - the minister for the Cabinet Office, which will conduct that investigation - and the prime minister suggest the outcome is already secure. The message seems clear: Priti's safe. It's also clear that we have entered a new phase of No 10's conflict with the civil service: 'unprecedented'is a word we are quickly wearing out. Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, declared that 'to end up with one of the most senior public servants in the country taking court action against one of the great offices of state shows a shocking level of breakdown in the normal functioning of government'ù. She's right: it is shocking. But civil servants aren't surprised. While bullying allegations have been mounting up against Patel for years, which she has denied, this is only a part of a 'wider pattern of behaviour'ù, as Rutnam said in his statement. This goes way beyond bullying. Any of the tens of thousands of civil servants who have strained every sinew to respond to the contradictions and convolutions of Brexit will tell you this has been a conflict years in the making. That the latest and worst skirmish has taken place at the Home Office is symbolic given its prominence as arguably the government's busiest Brexit-facing department. Even before properly facing down the multiple icebergs of a new border inspection regime, a new immigration system and claims of institutional racism, Brexit has already made the Home Office one of the most hazardous workplaces in government. In 2018-19 alone, 2,102 civil servants at the Home Office took time off work because of mental ill-health - at a cost of more than £12m. Add to this toxic landscape the presence and tactics of arguably the government's most combative senior minister, and it should surprise no one where these particular chickens have first come home to roost. Not even the prime minister may be able - even if he wanted - to adequately chlorinate them. I don't believe Boris Johnson seeks to actively create a bullying culture inside the civil service. But as the Brexit transition phase comes to an end, he is in danger of creating an enabling environment for the harassment of civil servants who are perceived to not have enough revolutionary zeal to attempt to deliver the impossible. We've already seen what happens when civil servants try to be practical about delivering Brexit. The best and most hopeful thing about Rutnam's stand was that it showed us the ends do not justify the means. 'Moving fast and breaking things'may be a catchy slogan for an emboldened new government in a hurry to 'get things done'ù. But when what is being broken is trust, it's a strategy that in the long-run will hurt us all.

Boris Johnson's bluster on Brexit is about to face reality,-0.25,Negative,"Bad ideas blunt the sharpest minds, and Boris Johnson's intellect was hardly an instrument of surgical precision before it rubbed up against a hard Brexit. The prime minister is no fool, but his talents are ill-suited to crafting a new relationship with the EU. Johnson's cleverness is rhetorical; his unique talent is for lifting spirits while lowering expectations. His upbeat bombast is laced with self-deprecation conveyed in his artfully tousled appearance and the elongated ums and ahs that signal improvisation, although the lines are scripted. The whole act is a wink inviting the audience in on a joke, the butt of which are 'doomsters and gloomsters'who try to hold Johnson to his word. He persuades his fans to take their satisfaction purely from the experience of being persuaded. To be seduced by him is to forgive him in advance for underachieving. The EU is unsusceptible to that charm. The negotiations that began in Brussels this week will codify legal obligations across multiple issues, and Johnson's inflated verbiage is not a meaningful currency in that commerce. It can be an impediment to progress when it undermines trust. Continental leaders take note when the prime minister tells manufacturers that they will encounter 'no forms, no checks, no barriers of any kind'for the transit of goods between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Ministers blithely dismiss the prospect of a customs border in the Irish Sea. The truth is that Northern Ireland will end up in a different regulatory space to the rest of the UK. That was a concession Johnson made last year to allow the UK to jettison EU rules without reimposing a combustible border on the island of Ireland. In a recent speech Johnson's chief negotiator, David Frost, set out a fundamentalist line on deviation from continental rules. The capacity to do so, he argued, was the essence of 'independence'and 'the point of Brexit'ù. When that ethos is pursued in practice, forms, checks and some kind of barrier to invigilate the boundary between EU and British jurisdictions are inevitable. A border in the Irish Sea is not a matter of conjecture. It is described in a treaty that Johnson signed and waved in triumph. But his enthusiasm was for the idea of a deal, not the real thing. He likes deals for their instant retail value in domestic politics, believing that problems in the small print can be blustered away. That is not how the trade negotiations work in Brussels, where the deal is the small print. Johnson's cavalier disregard for the facts of Brexit is where his character and Eurosceptic ideology are fused. It flows from the arrogant cultural assumption that Britain is pursuing its manifest destiny away from Europe, and that Brussels, by taking the legalistic approach, fails to see things in their true, epic perspective. That argument was the core of Frost's speech, which was Johnsonian in the way it camouflaged flabby thinking in historical dress. Smuggled between references to Edmund Burke and Charles de Gaulle were some strange ideas. (The heroic emancipation narrative implies that Britain loves independence more than other EU nations - or that they are not smart enough to grasp the abject nature of their colonial submission by Brussels). The Johnson-Frost doctrine rejects the Treasury view that disrupting trade between neighbours makes them poorer. Costs are outweighed by 'other factors'intrinsic to the 'complex and adaptive'nature of the modern economy, which in its unfathomable genius generates responses 'we do not foresee'and 'solutions we did not expect'ù. This hints at the view, championed in Downing Street by Dominic Cummings, that fretting about EU markets is for analogue scaredy cats who care too much about gravity and not enough about the weightless digital future. Farmers bleat about borders, but the 21st century belongs to countries that master artificial intelligence. The thesis is immune to evidence and too nebulous to be disproved in the time available for Brexit negotiations. It allows believers to write off any short-term disruption against notional gains down the line. If the prime minister believes this stuff - if he prefers pristine sovereignty in a hypothetical economy to defence of the real one - he has little incentive to compromise. And if compromise feels embarrassing, he might prefer to obstruct talks and blame EU intransigence when they collapse. There is a less pessimistic view: Johnson's priority with Brexit since the election has been to keep it out of the news. (He promised voters he could make it go away, and he wants that illusion to be complete. To that end, he needs any deal.) He will be relaxed with compromise because he thinks he can spin base metal into gold. Most Tory MPs will not sweat over the detail, and the 80-seat majority is a cushion against any rebels who do. Downing Street also expects to force concessions out of Brussels through brinkmanship, spooking the EU by threatening to walk away. In the authorised Tory version of history, that is what happened last year. Theresa May had a bad deal because she was afraid of no deal; Johnson wasn't, so he got a better one. In reality, Johnson's first offer of revised terms for Northern Ireland was laughed out of Brussels so he defaulted to a model that he had previously rejected. It is not the prime minister's style to admit retreat, so he now speaks of the withdrawal agreement in fictionalised terms, free from costs or Irish borders, as if it is the deal he wanted and not the one he got. This is the Johnson method: sign anything, then sell it as everything; make any economic sacrifice on the altar of wishful thinking; compromise for a deal then disown the downside. That last tenet is infuriating for the EU side, which needs to know that Britain after Brexit is still a country that honours treaties. It cannot afford to be the rogue kind that doesn't, but Johnson seems to think he can afford the political luxury of refusing to care. '¢ Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist ",-0.5,Negative
Brexit: Peugeot could seek compensation to keep UK factory open,-0.625,Negative,"Peugeot could demand compensation from the British government to keep its Vauxhall factory in Ellesmere Port open in the event of a bad Brexit deal, its chief executive has said. Carlos Tavares, the head of Peugeot's owner, PSA, said the carmaker's European workers should not be forced to bear the costs of 'customs barriers'between the UK and the EU when the transition period finishes at the end of the year. Carmakers have voiced concerns about the future trading relationship between the UK and EU, with repeated warnings that tariffs and customs checks could threaten the survival of large parts of the industry. The Ellesmere Port factory in Cheshire, which employs about 1,000 people, is seen as particularly vulnerable because a decision on building a new Vauxhall Astra model is overdue. PSA, which is merging with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, has already stopped investment in the factory. In a call with journalists on Tuesday, Tavares said: 'If we couldn't find a business case '¶ we would have to ask the UK government to compensate for that, because it is not ethically acceptable that we ask the continental European workers to pay for the customs barriers to enter the UK market. 'There is a point in time that the UK government needs also to respect its own people by creating conditions for the business in the UK to fly.'Tavares's comments came as carmakers arranged phone calls and online launch events to replace the Geneva motor show, which was cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak that has already rocked the global car industry. BMW executives swapped handshakes for fist bumps as they unveiled their new i4 electric car concept, a version of which is due to go on sale next year. The presentation was streamed from its Munich headquarters a day after the company quarantined 150 research and development employees after a colleague caught the virus. On a call with journalists, Ola K√§llenius, the chairman of the Mercedes-Benz owner, Daimler, said the company had been gradually increasing production at its Beijing plant since 10 February. The outbreak had highlighted the need to track supply chains back to source, he added. 'This is really day-by-day management,'he said. 'It is too early to tell what the full impact will be.'Tavares said coronavirus had been a 'wake-up call'for carmakers that they must take control of battery supply chains that are heavily dependent on China. Peugeot had been forced to step in to help a South Korean battery producer to increase production at a factory in Poland, with supply chains creaking. Shutdowns of battery materials plants in China in particular could make it more difficult for carmakers to hit EU emissions targets this year and next, according to Matthias Schmidt, a Berlin-based independent automotive analyst. Under the rules, which came into force at the start of the year, carmakers must reduce average carbon dioxide emissions of cars sold in the EU below an average of 95g per kilometre, or face steep fines. China is the world's key centre for battery manufacture. Of 442 companies involved in the automotive battery supply chain, 207 are based in China, according to the data supplier MarkLines. Honda said on Tuesday it was temporarily cutting production at its factory in Saitama, Japan, because of difficulties sourcing parts. The British supercar maker McLaren said it was flying in parts to bypass problems in its supply chain. As well as supplies, the outbreak has already hit carmakers' revenues. Sales have plummeted in China, after the world's largest car market virtually ground to a halt in early February as quarantine conditions were imposed. European and US sales could also be affected as the virus spreads. ",-1,Negative
Beating Covid-19? The new chancellor shouldn't budget on it,0.375,Positive,"Economic forecasting, at the best of times, is an uncertain task. For the purposes of forecasting the outlook for the British economy, this is not the best of times. Brexit uncertainty continues in that the negotiations on our future relationship with the EU are only just beginning. It is not obvious that any deal will be reached but, even if it is, the deal will be pretty thin. The economic consequences of such an outcome are disputed, in the sense that the vast majority of economists view this as a bad outcome for the economy and the government apparently doesn't. Thankfully for the credibility of our economic forecasts, we have an independent body of experts - the Office for Budget Responsibility - to make these forecasts. It was notable that the former chancellor, Sajid Javid, felt the need to defend the importance of the OBR in his resignation statement last week. The OBR has known for some time that it would have to address the sensitive issue of Brexit in its March 2020 forecasts. It now faces the further challenge of addressing the economic impact of the coronavirus. This is particularly difficult to predict because much will depend upon the virus itself. We do not know with great confidence how quickly Covid-19 will spread, what the mortality rates will be in advanced economies, whether there will be advances in treatment and if warmer, spring weather will see it off. As for the economic consequences, to what extent will supply chains be hit? How many people will be absent from work (because they are ill, self-isolating or caring for others)? How much will a negative story dominating the news for the weeks ahead dent consumer confidence? The impact is likely to be significant and immediate, albeit followed perhaps by a strong recovery with little lasting harm done to the economy. But a fall in GDP of 3% (which is the estimate made by a 2016 European Commission study of the impact of a pandemic on European growth) would be painful. Such a fall in GDP is more than half the size of the financial crisis contraction. Given the uncertainties, the OBR is likely to qualify its economic forecasts. This does not make the task of the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, any easier. He will be delivering his budget just four weeks after being appointed, with a powerful No 10 apparently indifferent to keeping control of the public finances, in a government that is pursuing a growth-damaging Brexit policy and in the midst of a health crisis that makes all short-term economic forecasts a matter of guesswork. It is quite a baptism of fire. If there is a substantial reduction in consumer confidence, there will be those who argue for a short-term fiscal stimulus. The Treasury will, I suspect, urge caution. The problems may be as much to do with supply as demand; fiscal tools can take a while to implement (a short-term cut in VAT probably being the immediate lever to pull) for an issue that might be relatively short term; and action can give the impression of panic, which would be self-defeating. In these turbulent circumstances, the chancellor would be entitled to take a cautious approach in his first budget. He will have a chance to get the wheels in motion for the increases in infrastructure spending due over the course of the parliament but, in an uncertain world, it would make sense for the autumn budget to be the big fiscal event of 2020.

Brexit: France says idea of Australia-style deal is 'for the birds',0,Neutral,"France has mocked Boris Johnson's claim that the UK can have an Australia-style deal with the EU after Brexit as 'for the birds'ù, warning an extra six months may be needed to strike an ambitious trade deal. Its European affairs minister told an audience in London that such a deal did not exist and it was time for both sides to realise the next phase of Brexit was 'for people '¶ not for politicians'ù. AmÈlie de Montchalin also warned that the EU would not be pressured into signing any trade deal by an 'artificial deadline'created by Johnson, and if Europe needed an extra six months to achieve a good deal for both sides then that is what should happen. In a speech to Chatham House, she indicated that France was prepared to take a robust approach to the UK's decision not to extend the transition period beyond December. She said it would be virtually impossible to do a deal in 11 months if the UK were to diverge completely on regulations, as that would require a hugely complicated 'line by line'negotiation on tariffs and border controls. The only way to achieve a deal in the time given was through close regulatory alignment, she said, warning that a crash out would be the UK's choice and not the EU's. 'We are not ready to sign any kind of deal on 31 December at 11pm. We cannot let our level of ambition be affected by what I would call an artificial deadline. If the UK decides to shorten the negotiating period, it will be the UK's responsibility. It will not be our choice on the European side,'she said. The prime minister has repeatedly projected a readiness to crash out at the end of the year, claiming that if talks collapse the UK would at least have an 'Australia-style deal'ù. This has been rubbished by many who point out that Australia does not have a deal with the EU and therefore this is just a euphemism for no deal. 'The idea that they're good to be an alternative to a free trade agreement, an honest level playing field, based on the Australia model (which by the way does not exist) is for the birds as you say in the UK,'De Montchalin said. She mocked the UK's rejection of the notion that the geographical proximity of the EU and the UK was a valid argument for a 'special relationship'that did not look like a Canada- or Australia-style deal. 'Our future relationship will necessarily be a special relationship. You are not Canada, you are certainly not Australia, first of all because you can get here by train. You are the United Kingdom and no matter what happens the UK will remain a strong economic power on the doorstep of the EU, geographically and economically. She said if the UK wanted a special relationship with the US it would still have to take account of the distance between the two nations. 'Paris and London are 300 miles apart. Boston and London are 3,000 miles away. It [a US trading relationship] could be more difficult,'De Montchalin said. She emphasised the UK must remember that when it was negotiating with the EU it was negotiating with 27 member states, which like the UK were 'sovereign'nations that had to protect the interests of their own citizens. If the UK were to recognise that it was sovereign states in play rather than an enemy EU, then a space would be opened for a deal, she indicated.  Her remarks came as the government released its roadmap for negotiations with the EU over the next 10 weeks, disclosing the key areas they will be discussing during talks. There will be five rounds of negotiations starting from Monday, with meetings alternating between London and Brussels and conducted in English. On the schedule are talks covering 11 topics: trade in goods; trade in services and investment; a level playing field for open and fair competition; transport; energy and civil nuclear cooperation; fisheries; mobility and social security coordination; law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters; thematic cooperation; participation in union programmes; and horizontal arrangements and governance. The thematic cooperation section refers to cybersecurity arrangements, as well as migration involving asylum seekers and those without the right to stay. The 'mobility'section will also look at arrangements that cover healthcare for tourists, short-term business visitors and making it easier for people who have paid into pensions in two or more countries to avoid dual social security liabilities. David Frost, the UK's chief negotiator or his deputy will lead the discussions on behalf of the UK and, after next week, rounds are scheduled for 18 March in London, 6 April in Brussels, 27 April in London and 13 May in Brussels. As already briefed by the government a 'stock-taking'meeting - at which point Britain could still walk away from talks - is planned for June. The rights of British citizens in the EU and their ability to move between EU states for work, and short-term visas for travel are also due to be discussed. Wider EU rights were settled in the withdrawal agreement phase. ",0,Neutral
"Condescension, false humility, divisiveness - welcome to Mikeyworld",-1.5,Negative,"Every Boris needs a Mikey. A minister who is every bit as morally bankrupt and spiritually dead as his boss. Someone untroubled by the past and whose capacity for mendacity and amnesia is almost limitless. So the prime minister is indeed fortunate to have Michael Gove as his deputy. Not that there haven't been a few bumps along the way. Once, back in June 2016, Gove did exhibit a hint of conscience, when he declared he couldn't possibly support Boris Johnson's bid to become Conservative leader as he was so clearly unfit for office. If you are being picky, you could ask what took Gove so long as he'd just spent the past few months standing next to him as he told lie after lie. But hey, every sucker deserves an even break. Better one sinner that repenteth and all that. Since then, though, the waters have rather closed over as Gove has rediscovered his special talent for self-deception. Beauty for the de facto deputy prime minister lies entirely in his ability to construct an argument. Whether it's true or not is entirely immaterial. If it sounds even slightly plausible, Mikey can believe almost anything. Even if it's only for one day.  For Gove there really only is one time. The present. The past is not even a foreign country; something to be rewritten and on which to impose import tariffs as required. There genuinely is no past. Every day he wakes up as a tabula rasa and is just as amazed as the rest of us to discover he is Boris's bag man. This is how he has come to move so effortlessly through Brexit positions. From being overrun with immigrants to being part of a free trade area to holding all the cards in negotiations with the EU. Only last Christmas he was saying there was no chance of the UK leaving without a trade deal. Now we're down to about 50/50 at best. There's a fair chance Gove talked marginally less bollocks when he was out of his head on coke. All of which made Mikey the only possible person - given Boris's current refusal to get out of bed for anyone or anything - to present the government's negotiating position for next week's trade talks with the EU. No other minister would have been able to do it while keeping a straight face or without breaking into a cold sweat. But for the Govester this was just another day at the office. An opportunity to indulge in casuistry without fears of any comeback. Because by the following day it would never have happened and he'd be free to believe something else. This was Gove in his element. False humility. Condescension presented as sincerity. Division masquerading as consensus. He began by talking of the new chapter in the nation's history. When the government had signed up to the political declaration it had always been clear it never really intended to keep its word. That had been obvious to everyone because Boris had implied the exact opposite during the general election campaign by insisting his deal was oven ready. So here was the deal. We'd be keeping to everything in the political declaration apart from the bits we didn't fancy. The rest wouldn't be binned per se. Just ignored. So all that nonsense about alignment would have to go. We were a sovereign country and we could do what the hell we liked. And we certainly wouldn't have anything to do with the European arrest warrant because otherwise we would deprive ourselves of the chance to become a safe haven for fugitives. A real growth sector for the economy. Only a handful of Tory backbenchers could be bothered to turn up for the ministerial statement - any level of detail was still well above their pay grade - so it was left to Labour and the SNP to seriously challenge the wisdom of telling the EU to go screw itself and that we were now pretty much a rogue state that couldn't be trusted to keep its word. Labour's Paul Blomfield couldn't see the problem with alignment as Gove was adamant we would never fall below EU standards. Hilary Benn observed that the kind of deal the government was hoping to get in a matter of months usually took a minimum of seven years. But Mikey was in Mikeyworld. There would be loads of jobs for Scots providing they all chose to work in the fishing industry. There was absolutely no reason for the government to produce an economic impact assessment of its proposals because it would only be written by an expert who wanted to talk down the UK. Just like the people who had compiled the Russia and Jennifer Arcuri reports. They certainly wouldn't be seeing the light of day. Most remarkably of all, he also promised to recruit and train another 50,000 customs officers within six months. Principally by retaining almost all the 58,000 officers they already had. Hell, it had worked for nurse numbers so it could work for Border Force. Long before the end, Mikey had even managed to contradict himself on Northern Ireland by insisting there both would and wouldn't be a border down the Irish Sea. Gove shrugged and checked his watch. He wasn't that bothered whether the UK reached a deal with the EU or not so he wasn't sure why he was wasting his time in the Commons. Besides, by the following day none of this would ever have happened. Lucky, lucky us to have a world with such men in it. ",-1.875,Negative
EU to demand right to punish UK if it fails to shadow Brussels rules,-0.25,Negative,"The EU will demand the right to punish Britain if the government fails to shadow the Brussels rulebook in the future, member states have agreed, as Boris Johnson was warned that the bloc would not be hurried into a deal on the future relationship. A final draft of the EU's negotiating position agreed by ambassadors on Monday, ready for ministerial sign off on Tuesday, establishes the bloc's developing environmental, social and workers' standards as the baseline for a trade deal. EU laws would not need to be adopted line-by-line by Westminster as they develop. But Brussels would retain the right to apply tariffs or other sanctions if any divergence between the two sides over time led to 'disruptions of the equal condition of competition'ù.  'It is about equality of outcomes,'one senior EU source said. France was alone in holding out for the guarantees that go beyond mere 'non-regression'from the current shared regulations. The bloc will demand that the British government apply EU state aid rules in their entirety as they evolve, in the one instance where Brussels is demanding complete alignment over time. The EU's state aid regime limits the levels of subsidies that can be given to industry. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, has admitted that such a policy is a 'red rag'to the UK. The leaked agreement, obtained by the Guardian, states that 'the envisaged agreement should uphold common high standards, and corresponding high standards over time with union standards as a reference point'ù. The EU also wants to establish a 'governing body'to oversee a deal that 'should be empowered to modify the level playing field commitments in order to include additional areas or to lay down higher standards over time'ù. The hardening of the EU position came as Johnson was warned that the French government would not be 'blackmailed'into a trade deal that risk its long-term economic interests. The prime minister's decision to rule out an extension of the transition period after 31 December 2020 has put pressure on both parties to work swiftly on a deal or face huge extra costs on trade when the UK leaves the single market and customs union. But speaking before a meeting of EU ministers on Tuesday, France's EU affairs minister, AmÈlie de Montchalin, used a TV interview to say her country would not 'sacrifice'the future of French industry, farming and fisheries to secure a swift deal. 'Just because Boris Johnson wants an agreement at all costs on 12/31 does not mean that we will sign a bad agreement for the French under the pressure of blackmail or time pressure,'De Montchalin later tweeted. Johnson has said he will not take up the option of extending the transition period for 'up to one or two years'ù, as envisaged in the withdrawal agreement. He has said he will accept tariffs and quotas on goods if a deal is not agreed in time. The UK is likely to publish its plans on Thursday after the EU's adoption of its negotiating mandate for the European commission. The talks on the future relationship are expected to start next week. Emmanuel Macron's government has been outspoken in internal EU discussions on the need to keep the UK 'dynamically aligned'ù. 'It is not that they think the British government will lower their standards but that EU policymakers will forever be looking over their shoulder, and we will hold back on the advances we want to make for fear of the competition on our doorstep,'said one diplomatic source. The UK has so far rejected any deal that involves alignment on policy or Britain remaining under the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, saying that a Canada-style trade deal, with looser provisions on ensuring a competitive level playing field, is the most appropriate option. EU diplomats were keen to agree Barnier's mandate by their self-imposed 25 February deadline to avoid potential British accusations of being unprepared or wasting time.  ",-0.25,Negative
Brexit: Emmanuel Macron 'not sure' trade deal possible by end of year,0,Neutral,"French president Emmanuel Macron on Saturday said he was 'not sure'it would be possible for the European Union and Britain to reach a trade deal by the end of the year. Britain and the EU are about to embark on negotiations aiming to hammer out a trade agreement by the time the post-Brexit transition period shuts at the end of December. But France has made clear it thinks the negotiations will be particularly difficult, especially in such a tight timeframe. 'I am not sure that an agreement will be reached between now and the end of the year,'Macron said at a meeting with fishermen, who are concerned for their livelihoods after Brexit, at an agricultural trade event in Paris. 'Anyway, it is going to become more tense because (the British) are very hard,'he said, adding that fishing rights would be a key point of contention. Britain formally ended its 47-year membership of the EU on January 31, nearly four years after a majority voted to leave the bloc in a 2016 referendum. France and several other countries want to be able to keep fishing in British waters, while London wants full autonomy and limited access for European fishermen. The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain's entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a 'deep-seated hostility'towards the European project. With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home. The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted ""yes"". Margaret Thatcher, later to be leader of the Conservative party, campaigned to remain. Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the ""iron lady"" marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand 'our own money back'claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back'despite being one of the 'three poorer'members of the community. It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.† Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in 'embryo'ù. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU. Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was 'òno, no, no' to what she saw as Delors' continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch's Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered 'Up yours Delors'front page. A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of 'a single market without barriers - visible or invisible - giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world's wealthiest and most prosperous people"". Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.† Tony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers' rights. Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. 'Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,'he said in his maiden speech.

EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club.

David Cameron returns from Brussels with an EU reform package - but it isn't enough to appease the Eurosceptic wing of his own party The UK votes to leave the European Union, triggering David Cameron's resignation and paving the way for Theresa May to become prime minister After years of parliamentary impasse during Theresa May's attempt to get a deal agreed, the UK leaves the EU. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said the EU's top priorities are fishing, security and maintaining fair trading conditions for European companies. He has also firmly rejected a British suggestion that City of London companies could be given broad, permanent access to EU markets without conditions. Overall, French fishing boats generate 30% of their revenue from catches in British maritime territories, particularly rich in fish stocks. French officials say that the UK exports the bulk of its catch to Europe, indicating that British fishermen have plenty to lose if the two sides fail to reach a deal. ",0,Neutral
Blue Brexit passports to be issued from next month,0.125,Positive,"Blue passports will be issued for the first time in almost three decades from next month to mark Britain's departure from the EU, the government has announced. They will replace the standard-issue burgundy passports that were rolled out across EU countries from 1988. The home secretary, Priti Patel, welcomed the switch back to blue, but pro-European campaigners and nationalist politicians in Northern Ireland predicted the new passports would result in Britons entering the slow lane at airports and ports throughout the EU. The Home Office says the blue passport will be 'the greenest British passport ever'ù. A spokesperson said: 'The carbon footprint produced through manufacture will be reduced to net zero, through projects such as planting trees.' It is also promoting the passport as the most technologically advanced. The spokesperson said there was 'a raft of new and updated security features, including a hard-wearing, super-strength polycarbonate data page, which contains innovative technologies embedded into the document, to keep personal data secure'ù. The new-look passport incorporates the latest and most secure printing and design techniques, the spokesperson said, which would offer better protection against identity theft and fraud. Patel said: 'Leaving the European Union gave us a unique opportunity to restore our national identity and forge a new path in the world. By returning to the iconic blue and gold design, the British passport will once again be entwined with our national identity and I cannot wait to travel on one.'The home secretary's enthusiasm was not shared by the European Movement. Edward McMillan-Scott, the group's patron and an MEP for 30 years, said the blue passport would be seen as offensive to many Europeans. 'It will be seen as a symbol of the attitude prevailing in the Conservative party towards the rest of Europe that is isolationist, ignorant and self-destructive,'he said. McMillan-Scott said recent scenes captured on Twitter of long queues at passport control in Amsterdam's Schipol airport involving British tourists were 'only the precursor for what is to come with these passports'ù. He said: 'When I was an MEP, I remember being given a special blue pass that was meant to make it easier for me to pass through border checks on my way to Brussels and Strasbourg. It was more hassle than it was worth because some border officials weren't sure what the document was and we got held up with endless checks. 'So I threw it away and started using my normal burgundy-coloured UK passport - the same colour as everyone else passing through the EU. Without doubt this marking out of British passport holders by having another colour will make life uncomfortable, especially for the millions travelling to the EU.'Claire Hanna, the pro-European Social Democratic and Labour MP for Belfast South, said: 'The fact that this is being lauded as a big win sums up Brexit. The colour changes but the opportunity and potential has been restricted. In this case, blue will represent economic harm and limited horizons for the passport holder, and that is a crying shame.'",0.125,Positive
An unworkable and costly immigration plan,-1,Negative,"On the face of it, the government's immigration policy shows continued support for NHS recruitment, with a lowered salary threshold and, for now, nurses included in the occupation shortage list. But the new policy does nothing to support social care, which is reliant on low-paid staff and is already struggling with huge funding constraints and increased demand (Fears for UK economy as Johnson closes border to unskilled workers, 19 February). The impact of poor social care provision on the NHS is well known. Without these vital services, the most vulnerable end up without the care they need. This in turn adds pressure to overstretched A&E departments, and patients have to stay in hospital for longer than they need because there is nowhere for them to go. Demand for both sectors is rising. Projected growth of the population aged 75 and over highlights that by 2035 the number of social care jobs in England could rise by 800,000. This cannot be met by the UK labour market alone. Moving to a points-based system that sets a minimum salary threshold above what a care worker earns, and not deeming the role as 'skilled'ù, fails to recognise their value or the needs they meet every day in homes and communities up and down the country. The government is failing to equip the social care sector to expand or even to retain its domestic workforce - the impact on patients, clients, carers and the NHS will be profound unless action is taken before 1 January 2021. If this is to be the way forward, we need to see an exemption for care workers, who perform such a vital role, and the chancellor must invest in social care in the budget. Otherwise the government will be switching off the taps and expecting the supply of staff to keep flowing.Niall DicksonChief executive, NHS Confederation '¢ My mother, who had dementia, was looked after in Sussex by nurses from Zimbabwe who were highly skilled in all sorts of ways, none of which would qualify them to stay in the UK under the proposed points system. They were fully trained by the agencies who employed them, and they were kind, compassionate, meticulous and reliable, 24 hours a day, as well as cooking the kind of food my mother liked and keeping her clean and groomed. All this on very low salaries. Experience shows that British nationals could not be recruited with these skills in sufficient numbers.Dr Richard TurnerBeverley, East Riding of Yorkshire '¢ This immigration policy gives the appearance of one concocted by a keyboard warrior in a back room in Islington. A policy drafted without consultation with those sectors of the economy dependent on a number of unskilled workers appears foolish. Headline-catching it may be, and it will certainly appeal those core Tory voters who are opposed to immigration. But is it practical? Apart from wreaking havoc on those industries dependent on unskilled immigrants, it will impose an additional burden on that most dysfunctional of ministries, the Home Office. If they cannot manage the current immigration system, how will they deal with thousands more visa applications to the UK? Is the government really prepared to create the huge new bureaucratic machine to manage the new immigration scheme it proposes? This government has yet to demonstrate that it can introduce and manage the universal credit system, so the possibility of it successfully introducing a new scheme to manage the movement of hundreds of thousands of workers seems unlikely.Derrick JoadLeeds '¢ In his analysis of the government's new points-based system, Larry Elliott says that 'workers from overseas will be welcomed provided they can clear the high bar set for them by the new immigration rules'(Taking back control is not the same as pulling up the drawbridge, 19 February). This is not how the system will work in reality. My experience of recruiting highly qualified people from non-EU countries under the current system leads me to fear that the new system will be as off-putting as the current one is: all overseas applicants will have to join a queue, and processing applications will be so slow that those in the pipeline will be tempted to look elsewhere.  I am not at all confident that the government will put in place an efficient application-processing operation when implementing the new points-based immigration system. While the UK was a member of the EU, it was at least possible to recruit highly talented non-UK staff relatively straightforwardly from countries on our doorstep, and the UK benefited hugely as a result. Now that those happy days are behind us, employers can expect bureaucratic inefficiency to cause recruitment delays in appointing all overseas talent, and this will in many cases mean that those recruited will not take up their posts because of the sheer frustration involved in waiting for a decision.David HeadPeterborough '¢ While Labour are right to condemn the Tories' actions on immigration, it was their shortsightedness that allowed the Brexit debate to take us down this dead end. They allowed our biased press to blame immigration and the EU for the problems of millions of British people, rather than pointing out that most of the discontent came from years of Tory austerity policies. This allowed Boris Johnson and his rightwing supporters to take us to where we are now: Brexit, and an awful government creating an increasingly hostile environment to 'outsiders'ù. I wonder who they will turn on when Brexit bites?

Scottish Tories urge rethink over points-based immigration,-0.25,Negative,"The Scottish Tory leader, Jackson Carlaw, plans to lobby Boris Johnson over complaints that Home Office plans for a points-based immigration system could damage Scotland's economy. In his first public statement on Priti Patel's plans, Carlaw told reporters at Holyrood he has been pressurising the home secretary to relax many of the obstacles to low-skilled, low-waged migrants she plans to introduce. Carlaw described Patel's proposals as a 'work in progress'ù, implying they broke the Scottish party's manifesto pledges in December's general election to introduce a system which worked for Scotland, particularly in remote areas suffering depopulation.

'I very much hope - and intend - that we will have a migration system in the final analysis and detail which is appropriate to Scotland,'he said. 'We made a specific promise that we need a migration system appropriate to Scotland's needs and our demographics and economy, and Scottish Conservatives remain committed to that. It's a work in progress, let's see how it unfolds.'Carlaw's intervention follows a furious backlash from Scottish businesses to Patel's proposals, particularly in industries like social care, tourism, fishing and farming. They have urged the UK government to allow far greater access for lower-skilled and seasonal workers, to work in hotels, fruit farms and fish processing factories - vacancies largely filled by EU workers before Brexit. With the increasingly vocal support of those industries, Nicola Sturgeon's devolved government has set out detailed plans for a so-called 'Scottish visa'designed to help Scottish businesses and public sector employers, and to tackle Scotland's lower birth rate and ageing population, which puts further pressure on the economy. Those plans were quickly rejected by the Home Office when they were published last month but Sturgeon pressed them again on Wednesday following Patel's announcement. Carlaw said he thought some of the Scottish government's proposals had merit, but did not elaborate. Asked if he agreed with the Scottish visa proposal, Carlaw said: 'The answer is to have a migration system which is appropriate to Scotland's needs. 'Actually, we're still digesting the Scottish government paper as well, which [we] believe had some quite sensible analysis of the situation and there were some sensible suggestions made in that too.'Sturgeon's official spokesman welcomed Scottish Tory efforts to liberalise the Home Office's proposals, but added: 'What the last day or two has shown is how utterly exposed Jackson Carlaw and the Scottish Tories are.

"Brexit deal 'a different ball game' to Canada agreement, warns EU",0.625,Positive,"Downing Street's hopes of a Canada-style trade deal with the EU have been dealt a further blow after a senior adviser to Brussels' chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the bloc's relationship with the North American country was a 'different ball game'ù. As the two sides prepare for the start of negotiations next month, Stefaan De Rynck highlighted the UK's proximity to Brussels compared with Canada as a key factor, as well as warning that the trade talks could get 'rather difficult'ù. The key aide also repeated what has now become an EU mantra that a tariff-free, quota-free deal is not possible without the UK committing to a 'level playing field'on state subsidies, environmental protections and workers' rights. This week the UK government's trade negotiator, David Frost, gave a speech in Brussels calling for a 'Canada free trade agreement-type relationship'ù. He said that 'to think that we might accept EU supervision on so-called level playing field issues simply fails to see the point of what we are doing'ù. In response, Barnier said the UK could not have the same trade deal with the EU as Canada. He said the EU was ready to offer an 'ambitious partnership'with the UK, but he said its 'particular proximity'meant it would be different. The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain's entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a 'deep-seated hostility'towards the European project.

It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.† Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in 'embryo'ù. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.

David Cameron returns from Brussels with an EU reform package - but it isn't enough to appease the Eurosceptic wing of his own party The UK votes to leave the European Union, triggering David Cameron's resignation and paving the way for Theresa May to become prime minister After years of parliamentary impasse during Theresa May's attempt to get a deal agreed, the UK leaves the EU. Speaking at the London School of Economics on Wednesday, De Rynck said: 'If you allow some irony, some in the UK now seem to want to become Canadians. But of course Dover is much closer to Calais than Ottawa is. The distance from Dover to Calais, and - thanks to the foresight of Margaret Thatcher and others - the speed of connection to the tunnel, is of course much quicker than what we have with our Canadian friends. So proximity matters.'He said what mattered was the interconnectedness between economies. 'Zero-quota, zero-tariff access, this brings a lot of benefits to the UK economy and with benefits come obligations,'De Rynck said. 'And it's clear that for us it's a different ball game that we are playing with the UK to the one that we agreed with Canada in terms of the level playing field.'He also said a written statement by Boris Johnson on 3 February, in which the prime minister outlined Downing Street's proposed approach to negotiations, was a 'source of some concern'ù. On the same day, Johnson gave a speech in Greenwich in which he claimed the UK would not need to accept EU rules in trade. He outlined the government's red lines but gave none of the detail that would be expected from parties about to embark on trade talks. EU member states are due to confirm the bloc's negotiating objectives at a meeting next week but the UK's plans to publish a mirror document next week have reportedly been cancelled. De Rynck said: 'We're certainly also looking forward to the UK document that was promised for next week. We, of course, have read the speeches that were given over the last week, also by the prime minister in Greenwich on the 3rd of February and other statements '¶ 'One written document that came out on the 3rd of February was the ministerial statement, which I cannot hide from you is a source of some concern in terms of the level of ambition of the political declaration not perhaps being fully met always by what is said in that ministerial statement. 'Notably on issues such as level playing field, the court of justice and internal security cooperation, the overarching governance framework which we have agreed with the United Kingdom.'Canada's deal with the EU, which took seven years to negotiate, eliminates most import tariffs on goods but not all. It also increases quotas - the amount of a product that can be exported without extra charges - but does not remove them entirely. The UK is in a transition period, after leaving the EU on 31 January, and has until the end of the year to hammer out a trade deal with Brussels. Until then, the country still follows the majority of EU rules. Highlighting the potential difficulty of negotiating in a tight timeframe, De Rynck said: 'We have a vast amount of work and we seem to have 10 months to do it, or less than 10 months if you calculate the time for ratification so that everybody can be ready on January 1, 2021 for the new regime. 'I would expect some of these negotiations to be rather difficult, perhaps more difficult that during withdrawal because the scope of issues is so much vaster.'",1,Positive
Will Boris Johnson's immigration reforms work? That depends on the Home Office,-0.125,Negative,"Two weeks ago the Home Office told the Sunday papers that the new 'points-based system'for immigration after Brexit would cut unskilled immigration from the EU by 90,000 'overnight'ù. And today the government has published more detail about its proposals, generating headlines such as 'Immigration revolution'and 'UK closes border to unskilled workers'ù. In fact, there's less here than meets the eye. Free movement will indeed end when the Brexit transition expires next January - but that's been government policy for more than three years. For the vast majority of new migrants, despite the branding, this isn't really a 'points-based system'in any meaningful sense, still less an 'Australian-style one'ù. Broadly, the government has accepted the recommendations of the independent migration advisory committee for the new system. There will be a salary threshold for migrants coming here to work - whether from inside or outside the EU - of £25,600 (more for those in higher paid occupations, less for new entrants). And a somewhat lower threshold for 'shortage occupations'and those with PhDs, especially in Stem subjects. This last will affect very few people but is presumably to placate Dominic Cummings. It is unclear if you'll get even more extra points for being a misfit or a weirdo. What will this mean for migration to the UK? Well, the government's 90,000 figure was just wrong, and it's notable that it hasn't repeated it. Not because it wasn't once a reasonable estimate of the impact of ending free movement - but because most of this impact has already happened. There aren't 90,000 unskilled EU migrants coming here now. In fact, net migration from the EU may already be close to zero (we'll get new figures next week). Moreover, the new system will be significantly less restrictive for migrants from outside the EU - whose numbers have already risen just as EU migration as fallen. So the overall impact on numbers is uncertain. In earlier work I estimated that a system like this might reduce migration by perhaps 40,000 a year, but the impact could well be even less. The government claims that overall numbers will indeed fall - and it might be right - but it's far from certain. That doesn't mean some sectors won't face challenges. Crucially it looks like the NHS and schools will be able to recruit skilled workers without worrying about salary thresholds (the national pay scales will apply). And finance, business services and higher education should also be able to live with this. But social care faces a big hit, unless it gets a big infusion of much-needed government funding that will allow it to increase wages and training budgets. Other sectors that have come to rely on EU migrants to provide a flexible (and often motivated and trained) workforce, from food processing to construction, will also be very worried. But perhaps the most important unknown is delivery. If the government delivers on its promises to make the new system quicker, more efficient, less bureaucratic and more user-friendly, it could indeed be good news for employers and the wider economy. A more liberal system for skilled migration, from anywhere in the world, could genuinely help mitigate some of the economic downsides that are likely to result from the new trade barriers Brexit will bring from January. That is a very big if. The Home Office already has a lot on its plate - implementing the settled status scheme for EU nationals who are resident here now, dealing with the ongoing fallout of the Windrush scandal, and so on. Its record hardly inspires confidence. And now it is being asked to introduce a new immigration system, to be up and running by the autumn of this year for people starting jobs from next January. So there is a big opportunity here for the government, but also huge risks. With public opinion much more favourable to skilled immigration than free movement - but also much less worried about numbers or impacts than at the time of the referendum - it has a chance to put in place a system that enables people from all over the world to come here to live, work and contribute. That would go a long way to showing the world that post-Brexit Britain can genuinely be global. But if the introduction of the new system is rushed or bungled, then it will have failed in its first big test, and the rest of the world will notice. The pressure is now on.

"Immigration: firms will need to train more UK workers, says Priti Patel",-0.25,Negative,"Companies will need to train more British workers to fill vacancies when the new immigration system kicks in requiring foreign workers to have qualifications and the ability to speak English, Priti Patel, the home secretary, has said. In a round of television and radio interviews, she said 8 million people between the ages of 16 and 64 were 'economically inactive'and could be given the skills to do jobs in sectors where there were shortages as a result of the new points-based system. Business groups from the CBI to the bodies representing the farming, hospitality and care work sectors have all raised the alarm about the new system, saying it will cause labour shortages. How it works  Bulgarian welder, holds A-level equivalent, has job offer for £26,000 a year, does not speak English. Now: Able to work in the UK under free movement rules.From January 2021: The worker scores points for a job offer, salary over £25,600, educational qualification, and working in a shortage occupation - meaning a score of 80 points, 10 more than the 70-point threshold. Ticks two of the three mandatory boxes for entry to the country - a job offer and job at appropriate skill level. But falling short on the third compulsory condition for entry of speaking English rules the welder out and they cannot come into the UK.† Sri Lankan production manager, has job offer for a salary of £28,000 a year, holds A-level equivalent, holds a PhD in a Stem subject, speaks English.† Now: Eligible courtesy of the requisite educational qualification of degree or over.†From January 2021: The worker earns less than the £34,000 'going rate'for their profession, meaning that they must pick up 70 points elsewhere to be eligible. They are not in a shortage occupation and so score zero on that point - but succeed nonetheless with 20 points for a job offer, 20 points for their A-level equivalent, 10 points for English, and 20 points for a PhD in a Stem subject - a total of exactly 70. Italian waiter has job offer in a hotel at £20,000, has languages degree and fluent in English.

Picks up 50 points. But scores zero for salary, zero for shortage occupation, does not have a PhD and cannot come into the country. But Patel insisted it would be necessary for businesses to look more to potential British workers, helping them to 'up their skills and make their skills relevant'to the job market. She was pressed by BBC Radio 5 live about the feasibility of training the 8 million people she cited when that is made up mostly of students, the long-term unemployed, the retired and those with caring responsibilities, with Britain almost at full employment. But Patel insisted that 20% of available working age people were inactive and could be encouraged into work. She said the government was 'no longer going to have a route for low-skilled workers to come to the UK'but denied this would be the end of Polish builders arriving in Britain as they could get jobs with construction companies rather than being self-employed. Patel also denied that she was closing the door behind her on immigrants after her parents came to the UK from east Africa to run a shop, saying they would have qualified under refugee route because of their persecution. Following the publication, industry leaders immediately accused the government of an assault on the economy warning of 'disastrous'consequences with job losses and closures in factories and the high street. A 10-page briefing document outlining the new immigration policy states: '¢ UK borders will be closed to non-skilled workers - and all migrants will have to speak English. '¢ Anyone wanting to come to the UK to work must have a job offer with a salary threshold of £25,600 - though a salary 'floor'of £20,480 will be acceptable in special cases where there might be a shortage, such as in nursing. '¢ There will be no route for self-employed people coming into the UK, spelling the end of, for example, Polish plumbers or Romanian builders arriving without a job. '¢ Border control will no longer accept ID cards from countries such as France and Italy. This, it is understood, is an attempt to clamp down on non-EU workers beating the system with forged or stolen ID cards. '¢ The skills threshold for foreign nationals wanting to work in the UK will be lowered from degree level to A-levels or their equivalent. The cap on the numbers of skilled workers is being scrapped - and a small number of highly skilled workers will be allowed to come in without a job. Industry leaders warned the changes would have a huge impact on food processing factories that rely heavily on EU workers to keep the supermarket shelves full with pre-packed chicken, beef and pork cuts. Tom Hadley, director of policy at the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, said: 'Jobs the government considers 'òlow-skilled' are vital to wellbeing and business growth. The announcement threatens to shut out the people we need to provide services the public rely on. 'We need access to workers that can help us look after the elderly, build homes and keep the economy strong.'The UKHospitality chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said 'ruling out a temporary, low-skilled route for migration in just 10 months' time would be disastrous for the hospitality sector and the British people'and deter investment in the high street. The Confederation of British Industry director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, said the removal of the cap on the number of skilled workers was welcome, but she warned that in 'some sectors, firms would be left wondering how they would recruit the people needed to run their businesses. 'With already low unemployment, firms in care, construction, hospitality, food and drink could be most affected,'she said. The hospitality sector will also be hit with no 'barista visa'for coffee shops, despite warnings from Pret A Manger two years ago that only one in 50 job applicants were British. The government said it was removing waiters, waitresses, and 'elementary'jobs in agriculture and fishing from the skilled list and added them to the unskilled list in line with the Migration Advisory Committee's recommendations.

Michel Barnier rejects UK call for Canada-style trade deal,-0.5,Negative,"Michel Barnier has rejected British demands for a Canada-style trade deal that would free the UK from EU rules as he made a thinly-veiled warning to Boris Johnson not to break his word. Speaking in response to a landmark speech by David Frost, Britain's Brexit negotiator, Barnier said such an offer was not on the table and noted that the prime minister had agreed only six months ago to stick to the EU's state aid rules and current social and environmental regulations after the transition period. Asked if Frost was right in his speech on Monday night to say that agreeing to such alignment in a trade deal would be undemocratic, Barnier told reporters: 'Truly not. It is a sovereign decision of the EU, it is a sovereign decision of the UK to cooperate '¶ That is what Boris Johnson wrote in the political declaration.'Within hours of Barnier's comments, the British government seized upon a change to the EU's draft negotiating mandate, leaked to the Guardian, which sources in Downing Street suggested was an attempt to win back the Parthenon marbles for Athens. The latest draft of the EU's negotiating position calls for both sides to 'address issues relating to the return or restitution of unlawfully removed cultural objects to their countries of origin'ù. 'This is just not happening,'a Downing Street source said with reference to suggestions that the language referred to the return of the ancient marble sculptures to Athens. 'And it shows a troubling lack of seriousness about negotiations on the EU side.'The Downing Street intervention came despite both Greek and EU officials insisting that the clause, proposed by Italy, Spain, Cyprus and Greece, was not related to the marbles held by the British museum but merely to a desire to stop the fraudulent movement of antiquities around Europe. One senior EU source likened the row as throwing a 'dead cat'on the table to divert attention from the fallout from Frost's comments. The explosion of rhetoric on both sides of the Channel offers little hope that the next 11 months of talks will be smooth. In his speech on Monday night, Frost had set a tough line on EU demands by claiming the consent of the British public would 'snap dramatically and finally'if the UK continued to be bound to the EU rulebook after December 2020. The latest EU negotiating mandate says those level playing field provisions should further develop 'over time'ù. Frost went on to suggest that Brussels should offer a trade deal similar to that given to Canada, which avoided any European court of justice supervision of standards or demands on 'alignment'with Brussels. Barnier's response, and that of other EU officials, was one of polite fury. Sources said the EU negotiator had privately suggested to MEPs that the UK was backsliding on the political declaration on the future relationship signed last year. 'We have proposed a trade agreement with a country that has a very particular and unique close geographical proximity not like Canada, not like South Korea and not like Japan,'Barnier said. 'Very particular. We are ready to propose and work very quickly with Britain on the basis of the political declaration, which was agreed with Boris Johnson. We stand ready to propose this agreement, if the UK wants it.'Speaking separately, the EU's trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, warned that the UK would bear 'full responsibility'for its choices. 'We're looking for a level playing field and they don't seem to want it,'Hogan said. 'It's a big worry for many of the manufacturing sectors in the UK. If they want to diverge from the existing rules and regulations, we are going to have problems. And the more they diverge from the existing EU law and regulations, the more problems we'll have.'Guy Verhofstadt, a senior MEP and former prime minister of Belgium, who has led the European parliament's approach to Brexit, said the UK was approaching the negotiation as if the sides were 'living on two different planets'ù. He added that it would be a 'hell of a job'to secure a successful outcome from the negotiation given the British approach. In response to the row over the Parthenon marbles, a spokesman for the British Museum noted the Greek government's denial that it would pursue the statues during the trade negotiations with the UK. The spokesman said: 'The British Museum welcomes this mandate and is committed to fighting the trade in illicit antiquities across the world. 'We work in partnership with law enforcement agencies to identify and help to return objects that come into the UK illegally. The Parthenon sculptures were legally acquired and help us to tell the story of human history presented at the Museum. They are accessible to the 6 million global visitors the museum receives each year.'",-0.125,Negative
Sadiq Khan urges EU to offer Britons 'associate citizenship',0,Neutral,"The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has implored EU negotiators during a visit to Brussels to offer free movement for Britons through 'associate citizenship'ù, as the 'next best thing'to membership. With the backing of the former prime minister of Belgium Guy Verhofstadt, Khan called for the idea to be at the 'the heart'of the negotiations over the future relationship. Khan said that rejoining the EU was not foreseeable in the 'short to medium term'but that associate citizenship of the bloc could be one way to 'make the best of Brexit'ù. The idea had been first raised in late 2016 by Verhofstadt, who was then the European parliament's Brexit coordinator. The offer would include continued freedom of movement and residence around the bloc for those who wished to retain such rights. Such a status would also protect rights in healthcare, welfare and workplace conditions and likely the right to vote in European parliament elections. Khan told reporters that he believed the idea had merit. 'There's an opportunity for us to move forward with this and I've been pleased with the response and it gives hope to London, as well as across our country'ù, he said, following meetings with EU officials.  The chances of such an initiative making headway in the negotiations are extremely limited as it would be unlawful under EU legislation. There is unlikely to be appetite for any rewriting of treaties among the 27 member states, given the UK government's hostile attitude to the free movement of EU nationals who wish to live and work in Britain.

"We won't budge on escaping EU rules, says UK's Brexit negotiator",0.25,Positive,"The democratic consent of the British public would 'snap dramatically and finally'if the UK continued to be tied to EU rules, Boris Johnson's chief Brexit negotiator has said. In his first public speech since his appointment to the role, David Frost said Downing Street was not engaging in game-playing by rejecting alignment with EU laws after 2020. In a significant opening to Brussels, Frost conceded that the negotiators would need to build on the models contained in other EU free trade deals. But he insisted that the ability to break free from the EU's rulebook was essential to the purpose of Brexit and that the UK's position would be tabled in 'written form'next week. 'We are not looking for anything special,'he said. Frost, a former ambassador to Denmark, went on to reject suggestions that the European court of justice would supervise any 'level playing field'conditions designed to ensure that neither side undercuts the other. He also said that the UK would not take part in any EU programmes or agencies that put the country under the jurisdiction of the EU court. 'We bring to the negotiations not some clever tactical positioning but the fundamentals of what it means to be an independent country,'he said. 'It is central to our vision that we must have the ability to set laws that suit us - to claim the right that every other non-EU country in the world has.'The EU's negotiating mandate is due to be finalised on 25 February. A draft document published this month indicated that Brussels would seek at least 'non-regression'from current environmental, social and workers' standards once the UK has left the single market and customs union on 31 December 2020. The bloc is also likely to demand 'dynamic alignment'by the UK on the EU's state aid and competition rules. The UK would establish an independent body overseeing the rules but it would work in cooperation with the European commission. The European court of justice would be the final arbiter of EU law. The EU has argued that the need to maintain standards is keener in the case of Britain due to its proximity to the European market. Johnson said in a recent speech in Greenwich that he would rather accept heavy tariffs on goods being traded than sign up to anything so onerous. Frost said in Brussels: 'Regulations and regulatory decisions are so fundamental to the way the population of a territory feels bound into the legitimacy of its government that this structure would be simply unsustainable: at some point democratic consent would snap - dramatically and finally.'He went on: 'It isn't a simple negotiating position which might move under pressure, it is the point of the whole project. That's also why we will not extend the transition beyond the end of this year. At that point we recover our political and economic independence in full. Why would we want to postpone it? 'In short, we only want what other independent countries have. Boris Johnson's speech in Greenwich two weeks ago set out a record of consistently high standards of regulation and behaviour in the UK, in many cases better than EU norms or practice. How would you feel if the UK demanded that, to protect ourselves, the EU dynamically harmonise with our national laws set in Westminster and the decisions of our own regulators and courts?'Frost offered an opening, however, for the two sides to develop the models of free trade agreements that the EU has signed with Canada, South Korea and Japan. Those agreements include provisions that prevent either side from ignoring or lowering labour standards to boost trade. They also provide for both sides to consult with each other on subsidies and find solutions where such state aid creates unfair competition. Frost said: 'The reason we expect - for example - open and fair competition provisions based on free trade agreement precedent is not that we want a minimalist outcome on competition laws. It is that the model of an FTA and the precedents contained in actual agreed FTAs are the most appropriate ones for the relationship of sovereign entities in highly sensitive areas relating to how their jurisdictions are governed and how their populations give consent to that government. 'So if it is true, as we hear from our friends in the commission and the 27, that the EU wants a durable and sustainable relationship in this highly sensitive area, the only way forward is to build on this approach of a relationship of equals.'Frost said that he personally believed that Britain's exit from the EU had been 'inevitable'and that he hoped to dissuade the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, from the view that Brexit was about 'damage limitation'ù. Describing Treasury predictions in 2018 about the economy after Brexit as 'speculative'ù, Frost said the studies exaggerated the impact of non-tariff barriers and customs costs to businesses and failed to recognise the likely upside of an increase in productivity. He said: 'There is obviously a one-off cost from the introduction of friction and a customs and regulatory border but I am simply not convinced it is anything like the scale of effect that these studies suggest '¶ 'It's possible to be political partner and economic competitor. Economic competition boosts wealth for everybody in the long run and the more genuine economic competition across Europe, but it's not competition for low standards '¶ 'Michel [Barnier], I hope I convince you to see things differently and Britain doing things differently might be good for Europe as well as Britain '¶ We understand the trade-offs involved.'",0.5,Positive
Brexit: Macron pushes for tougher EU negotiating position,0,Neutral,"Emmanuel Macron is making a last-ditch push for a tougher EU negotiating position with Britain over the post-Brexit relationship despite concerns among other member states that they risk blowing up the talks before they have begun. The conclusion of an internal decision on Brussels's so-called level playing field demands has been delayed as the French government continues to push for stronger commitments on regulatory alignment to be asked of the British in return for maintaining free trade. Boris Johnson has in recent days made clear his rejection of the idea that the UK will shadow EU rules after the transition period given that he is not seeking 'frictionless'trade at the borders. His chief negotiator, David Frost, is expected to build upon that in a speech in Belgium next Monday evening. EU sources said there was a concern among some member states that negotiating avenues could be closed off even before the two sides sit down to talk in the first week of March. 'You need space to find common ground,'said one diplomat. The EU's initial draft negotiating position, outlined by the bloc's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, two weeks ago, had called on the UK not to go below current standards on environmental, social and workers' rights and stay in line with Brussels on state aid and competition rules as they develop. France has, however, been an outspoken voice, albeit not entirely isolated among the 27 member states, in calling for more 'ambitious'commitments to be a condition for the UK government in any future treaty. There is a concern that EU attempts to increase its environmental standards, in particular, will be held back if there is a risk that British companies will be left able to undercut European firms in a decade or longer. 'The French don't say the words 'òdynamic alignment' in discussions now but talk about the need for more clarity and ambitious commitments,'said one EU source of the latest internal debate. 'The text will probably go further that way. The problem is that this is a negotiation and we don't want to close the door at this stage. That is the concern.'Johnson has said the UK will not align with EU regulations as the price of a free trade deal, and that if Brussels insists the British government will settle for trade on WTO terms, including tariffs and quantity quotas on goods crossing the Channel. The French president, Macron, has in turn spoken in public of the need to ensure Britain is not given a competitive advantage in the long term. Macron's ambassador to the EU, during a three-hour meeting on Wednesday evening, which followed an eight-hour session among diplomats earlier in the week, insisted on Wednesday that there should be no scope for the UK to 'misunderstand'the need for maintaining standards to EU levels. The latest draft negotiating position is now to be circulated among the member states on Thursday but without the most controversial and sensitive section on state aid and environmental, social and workers' rights. The EU debate will continue into next week to allow ministers to then sign off on the position on 25 February, allowing negotiations with the British to start in the first week of March. 'We understand that this needs to be done swiftly to maintain credibility with our negotiating partner,'said a diplomat. Additions to the original European commission text already include that the 'level playing field'commitments should prevent unfair competitive advantages 'over time so as to ensure a sustainable and long-lasting relationship'ù. In terms of fishing rights in British waters, the draft mandate says the two sides should also 'uphold'existing reciprocal access conditions rather than merely 'build'on the current terms of the common fisheries policy. The UK will remain in the single market and customs union until the end of 2020 after which the government has accepted that there will be checks and controls at the borders with the EU. A UK government source said: 'Half the time the EU is telling us they are surprised we are not more 'òambitious' and the other half of the time they are saying we're looking for too much. 'It's now the EU who are cherry-picking, suggesting ambition only where it suits them and adding obligations that go beyond a standard free trade agreement. We are clear and consistent about what we want - not a bespoke or special FTA, but similar to the one the EU already has with Canada.'",0,Neutral
Leaving the EU doesn't mean we have to stop being European,0,Neutral,"I was inspired by Ed Vulliamy's eulogy of Europeanness (For me, being European is about who and what we are: a way of being, sans fronti√®res, Travel, 8 February). Some of his experiences resonated with mine: I too spent a lot of youthful time travelling around the continent in the 1960s and 70s, and still do whenever I can. Like Ed, I revel in the shift of tastes, sights, smells and languages, as you move from place to place, while recognising a commonality of experiences too. Like him (though not perhaps as well as him), I've tried to learn enough of the local language to engage with the people I find myself among. And, like him, I feel - culturally and politically - very 'European'ù. But why his despairing ending, concluding that he's no longer part of this? The UK has simply left one particular European political (and business) institution; it remains a member of other international organisations within Europe, such as the OSCE and the Council of Europe. British cultural, sporting, scientific, broadcasting, political and other bodies continue as part of their own European networks. Ed and I continue to have our friendships with people around the continent. For as long as I can remember, most of the personal and institutional links between Britain and other European countries that really matter have existed irrespective of either country's membership, or not, of the EU (and where EU membership has been relevant, it's sometimes been inimical to those connections), and there's no reason for that to change. If 'being European'really does become more difficult for British people after Brexit, it'll be because of centralising, power-grabbing and vindictive tendencies within the EU structure, not because there's any logical reason why it need be so.Albert BealeKing's Cross, London '¢ George Monbiot ('òTry to stop me.' How our leaders are now ruling with impunity, Journal, 5 February) asserts that it was 'the Brexit vote that eventually enabled Boris Johnson to take office'ù. Nothing could be further from the truth. What put Johnson into No 10 was a coalition of anti-Brexit MPs inside the Labour party (some 200 of them led by Keir Starmer), and Lib Dem MPs teaming up with the Tory party's European Research Group. Together they trashed Theresa May's deal on three occasions. It was the weirdest of alliances. The remainer Labour and Lib Dem MPs did it in the hope they could scupper Brexit for good; the ERG did it in the hope that Brexit would come about with a no deal. The EU had agreed the May deal, it would have kept us close to the EU, and if it had been carried, Mrs May, not Boris Johnson, would be prime minister still. That is the indisputable fact of the matter. But defeated three times by parliament, Mrs May had to resign. Her resignation necessitated the election of a new Tory leader and that put Johnson into No 10. And if having Johnson as PM isn't bad enough, there is now the possibility that the ultimate outcome will be a no deal. As it stands, the ERG are in the driving seat while both Labour and the Lib Dems have been trashed by their own dreadful miscalculations and tactics and their refusal to accept the democratic decision of the people. Johnson and Dominic Cummings just cannot believe their luck.Michael KnowlesCongleton, Cheshire  '¢ Dr William Dixon (Letters, 12 February) argues that 'the Tory party has its share of ideologues; but, whatever they may think, they do not call the shots'ù.

"German digital bank N26 pulls out of UK, blaming Brexit",0,Neutral,"The German digital bank N26 is has blamed Brexit for its decision to pull out of the UK and close more than 200,000 customer accounts. The lender has given customers less than two months to move their money, with all UK accounts to be closed by 15 April. It has also stopped offering new accounts to UK residents. The move comes less than 18 months after the Berlin-based firm launched in the UK. It had about a dozen employees in the UK, with the rest of the business run remotely from the German capital. The 'challenger bank'ù, which has attracted investors including the US and Hong Kong billionaires Peter Thiel and Li Ka-shing, and the Chinese tech giant Tencent, blamed Brexit for its decision to leave the UK. 'The timings and framework outlined in the EU withdrawal agreement mean that the company will in due course be unable to operate in the UK with its European banking licence.'As recently as October, N26 was publishing blogposts assuring customers that it would continue in the UK after Brexit. Those posts have since been deleted. The bank - which has 5 million customers in the EU - was relying on passporting rights that allowed it to use its German licence to operate in the UK. It originally planned to take advantage of the British regulator's temporary permissions regime to continue operating in the country after Brexit. Those rules allow EU financial services firms to continue operating after the transition period ending on 31 December 2020, giving them three years to apply for a formal licence. However, the Guardian understands the company changed its mind as it believed the costs were starting to outweigh the benefits of staying in the UK market. John Cronin, a financial analyst at the stockbroker Goodbody, said: 'It's quite a competitive market. N26 certainly made some inroads from a savings perspective. But the challenge is on the other side of the balance sheet in terms of monetising deposits.'As part of the announcement to leave the UK market, Will Sorby, the general manager of N26 UK, said: 'We would like to thank all N26 customers for their support. We've planned the next steps carefully to ensure this process is as smooth as possible for every customer in the UK.'",0,Neutral
Michael Gove confirms post-Brexit trade barriers will be imposed,0,Neutral,"Michael Gove has told businesses that trade with Europe they need to prepare for 'significant change'with 'inevitable'border checks for 'almost everybody'who imports from the EU from next year. In the first official confirmation that the government is going to impose trade barriers post-Brexit, he warned there would be checks on food and goods of animal origin, plus customs declarations and mandatory safety and security certificates required for all imports. 'You have to accept we will need some friction. We will minimise it but it is an inevitability of our departure,'he told delegates at a Cabinet Office event held in central London on Monday, entitled Preparing Our Border for the Future Relationship. 'I don't underestimate the fact that this is a significant change, but we have time now to make that change.'Gove, who as chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is de facto deputy prime minister, also warned delegates it could take five years to get a smart border involving online processes up and running and said businesses had to be ready for the change next January, whatever the outcome of the next phase of Brexit negotiations. 'In questions and answers his officials talked of an 'òoperational border' from the beginning of 2021, which they said was laying the foundation for best borders in 2025,'said one delegate, who reported that Gove had warned the UK must be ready for the completion of Brexit on 1 January next year when the transition period ends. Later the government issued an official update confirming checks on both imports and exports. The update warned that the 'policy easements put in place for a potential no-deal exit will not be reintroduced as businesses have time to prepare'ù. The 'easements'that will not apply include deferred VAT payments on imports, which the government had considered in a no-deal plan. Echoing Boris Johnson's comments in a speech last week, Gove spoke of pursuing a Canada or Australian-type deal, which EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has said was 'code for no deal'as the bloc does not have a deal with Australia. According to attendees, Gove was also adamant that the government would stick to its vow to no longer follow EU rules that would allow it to minimise future barriers in cross-border trade. 'The only way in which you could avoid those customs procedures and regulatory checks would be if you were to align with EU law and if you were to align with EU law we would be undermining the basis on which the prime minister secured the mandate at the general election to affirm our departure,'Gove said in comments that were recorded. However, Gove did seem to distance himself from recent comments by the chancellor, Sajid Javid, that suggested business should stop complaining about future trade barriers as they have known about Brexit since 2016. The Food and Drink Federation raised concerns about the lack of time to deliver the plans adding that 'any additional friction into the UK-EU trading relationship will inevitably have a cost for businesses, consumers and shoppers'ù. It called on the government to 'lead the way'and 'proceed at pace'to start building the border inspection posts and ensure regulators such as the Food Standards Agency have sufficient resources for 'these new responsibilities'ù.  Elizabeth de Jong, the Freight Transport Association's UK policy director, said: 'Gove put to rest Javid's assertion that industry had plenty of time to prepare. It is encouraging for industry that he said he does not underestimate what needs to be done.'She also raised concerns that the IT systems would not be ready until 2025. 'We are naturally disappointed that the promise of frictionless trade has been replaced with a promise that trade will be as seamless as possible but not until 2025, with a more realistic but costly 'òmake do and mend' approach to be employed until then.'Richard Ballantyne, chief executive of the British Ports Association, said: 'We may not like what we are hearing, but if you get a clear message than you can plan.'Jill Rutter, senior research fellow at UK in a changing Europe tweeted that the move will see a 'massive increase in red tape'ù. This will at a stroke remove any benefits from any business trading with the EU of @sajidjavid red tape challenge.. this is a massive increase in red tape... https://t.co/xc704Ql5Iu Gove's address is the first official confirmation on the detailed border checks to come, something industry leaders particularly in car manufacturing and in agriculture have campaigned against. He told the London event it was the government's aspiration to make sure trading with the EU was 'as smooth and trouble free as possible'but that 'we also need to ensure that people are ready for the regulatory checks that will follow'ù. He told them 'it is the case there will be [sanitary and phytosanitary] checks'for those trading food or goods of animal origin. 'It is likely as is the case with [the Canadian trade deal] that there will be some physical checks of those products as well and it will be the case that we will almost certainly need safety and security certificates as well,'he said. 'It will be the case almost everybody who is exporting will need to complete customs declarations.'",0,Neutral
EU clamps down on free ports over crime and terrorism links,0.375,Positive,"Brussels is clamping down on 82 free ports or free zones after identifying that their special tariff and duty status has aided the financing of terrorism, money laundering and organised crime. A set of new rules was introduced by the European commission just weeks before the launch on Monday of a UK government consultation on the creation of up to 10 free ports in post-Brexit Britain. Authorities across the EU have been obliged since 10 January to take extra measures to identify and report suspicious activities at the ports and zones as a result of the 'high incidence of corruption, tax evasion, criminal activity'ù. The EU's executive branch has said it will review the issue again next year owing to the popularity of such ports among high-net-worth individuals and criminal organisations seeking to circumvent recent crackdowns on bank secrecy. Free ports or free zones are a type of special economic zone (SEZ) where business and trade laws differ from those in the rest of the country. Goods can be landed, stored, handled, manufactured or reconfigured and re-exported without being subject to customs duty. Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the UK Treasury, inaccurately claimed on Monday that 'the EU is pretty much the only place in the world that doesn't use free ports'ù. In reality, the EU's customs code does allow for free ports or zones and there are 82 of them across the countries that are subject to its regulations. The Isle of Man, a British crown dependency that is neither part of the EU nor the UK, operates a free port. The British government has said it wants the first to be opened in the UK by 2021. In July, the commission said free ports, popular for the storage of art, precious stones, antiques, gold and wine as alternative assets to cash, posed an emerging threat in multiple ways. The ports are said to allow counterfeiters to land consignments, tamper with loads or associated paperwork and re-export the products without customs intervention, disguising the true origin and nature of the goods, and the identity of the original supplier. The commission said they were also used for narcotics trafficking, the illegal ivory trade, people smuggling, VAT fraud, corruption and money laundering. 'Legal businesses owned by criminals remain key to money-laundering activities'ù, the report said. 'Free ports are perceived as facilities that protect their clients' identity and financial dealings, much as private banks used to.'As an example of the nefarious activities taking place at such sites, the commission noted that in December 2016, Swiss authorities seized cultural relics looted from Syria, Libya and Yemen that were being stored in Geneva's free ports. 'The looters had brought the confiscated objects to Switzerland via Qatar'ù, the EU report said. 'Three of the pieces were from the ancient city of Palmyra, a Unesco world heritage site systematically destroyed by [Islamic State] jihadists who had seized it in May 2015.''Free ports are conducive to secrecy,'the report added. 'With their preferential treatment, they resemble offshore financial centres, offering a high degree of security and discretion, and permitting transactions without attracting the attention of regulators or direct tax authorities.'The British government has argued that the proposed new zones could bring thousands of new jobs and significant investment but the conclusions of trade experts have been mixed. A report from the UK Trade Policy Observatory suggested the benefits would be 'tiny'ù, while the construction group Mace argued the creation of free ports could create 150,000 new jobs and add £9bn a year to the UK economy. A report from the European parliament last year noted that a growing demand for free ports could in part be explained by a recent global crackdown on tax evasion. The US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the OECD's 2014 Common Reporting Standard (CRS) make it hard for individuals to escape taxation on proceeds of funds held in bank accounts.

Horrible Histories? We're living through one right now,-0.625,Negative,"ùWas any of the licence fee used to produce something purely designed to demean us?'ù, the elderly BBC journalist Andrew Neil tweeted, regarding last week's nine-minute European-themed compilation of the delightful children's series Horrible Histories. In these arse-tip times, the multiple-Bafta-award-winning success is 'unpatriotic'ù, while pouring cider on a smouldering EU flag is the tits. But Horrible Histories, more than any other human endeavour, fulfils the Reithian remit to 'inform, educate and entertain'ù. In the very British tradition of the music hall, Monty Python and 1066 and All That, the show brings the past irreverently to life for generations of future historians, many too distressed by Neil's gibbous presence to learn from his informative broadcasts. And yet, long ago, I had heard Neil's words before. 'Was any of the licence fee used to produce something purely designed to demean us?'journalist and former adviser to Paddy Ashdown Miranda Green asked, as we looked, sickened, into a backstage Westminster workspace. It was 27 February 2014. We were among that week's This Week guests. And we witnessed the foulest of finishing touches, added to a horrible project, shrouded in terrible secrecy - the weekly reboot of Andrew Neil's hair. The atrocity Green and I saw enacted that night felt like a calculated insult to our species. And though Green and I have often been in the same room since, most recently at the premiere of Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, she never acknowledges me, afraid of reliving our experience. Seven years ago, Neil was just journalism's clammy Christmas uncle, then unstained by the inelegant small-hours cyber-frothing for which he is now famed. But would even Neil's cannibalistic countryman Sawney Bean nestle into Michael Portillo's fluffed cushions had he seen the eyesore Green and I saw? For the horrid contents of Bean's sick mountain nook were as nothing compared to the gore-strewn phantasmagoria of Neil's obscene powder room. As Michael Portillo emptied a bin of stunned bats on to the floor, disgusted BBC beauticians presented the dazed mammals to the light, seeking the most taut scrotum. Neil, sat in shadow in a wicker bath chair and a silken robe, cried out: 'That's it! Stretch them! Stretch those bloody bats' scrotums, girls, like your lives depend on it.'Portillo choked the chosen bat and tightened its scrotum over a nameless and putrid woodland fungus, sculpted to be the size and shape of Neil's head. Then he slung the unwanted bat parts into the corridor, where they stank. Another guest, Pat Kane, of pop group the Kane Gang, walked by unaware, suspiciously sniffing the air. Years later, I learned online that he attributed the stench to me. Donning an enormous chef's hat, Portillo grated tiny shavings of fennel on to the bat scrotum, which were then tweezer-teased to attention. Then this week's This Week hairpiece was nailed to Neil's needy nut. Green and I knew we had seen something which, if we valued our careers, we should contrive to forget. But fennel-hair Neil isn't alone in criticising Horrible Histories. The show's supposed 'lack of patriotism'is now another useful skirmish in both the inevitable dismantling of public broadcasting and a wider culture war; a culture war deliberately coordinated to mop up the last pockets of bedraggled resistance to a far-right coup; a far-right coup that appears to be an intentional result of Brexit; a result that may in fact have been Brexit's real raisin of being all along, for those who worked hardest to deliver it. Indeed, the photograph tweeted out by P Staines (the online influencer Guido Fawkes) of last week's guest list of client-commentators, at what was genuinely called the Brexit Battalion Media Corps celebration dinner, tells you all you need to know. Google it. It was always a stitch-up. If you were lucky enough to be seated for parsnip soup with Tony Parsons, baked rack of venison with inaccurate Allison Pearson, hot raspberry ripple with realist Rod Liddle and finally a Stinking Bishop with Father Alexander Sherbrooke, you would surely feel like you had been present at Brexit Britain's equivalent of the storied Algonquin Round Table. Except that instead of dropping Dorothy Parker wit-bombs, diners were saying things like: 'In that case presumably I can choose to identify as a 17-year-old Swedish au pair!'or: 'I like my women like I like my bananas, firm and fresh, not old and past their sell-by date.'Did the once-salvageable Dan Hodges wonder how the journey of his life led him to this infernal banquet of the damned, a Florence fresco of doomed sinners sharing shit-flavoured stew with impossibly long spoons, while being stuffed into the devil's anus, or twitching Tim Montgomerie, as it is also known? Of course, the Horrible Histories non-story, turning on an axis of anger about a silly song featuring Queen Victoria from 11 years ago, and introduced by an uppity coloured feller who should know his place, was deliberately weaponised to bully the BBC into toeing the government line, an ongoing attempt to eliminate the last vestiges of scrutiny. Will any of the Cumming-trombones at BBC News attempt to square the current prime minister's condemnation of 'juvenile anti-Americanism'with the fact that, when London mayor, the same man called Donald Trump a person of 'quite stupefying ignorance that makes him, frankly, unfit to hold the office of president of the United States'ù? Was any of the licence fee spent on not asking him about this? Thought not. As you were, lickspittle collaborators. On Monday night, however, journalists collectively, even the compliant Kuenssberg whose electoral fealty Cumming will yet forget, stood firm against Conservative attempts to exclude critical correspondents from briefings. For now. But first they came for the black satirist; then they came for the policeman from Hot Fuzz doing a silly William the Conqueror dance; then they came for the Hanoverian kings singing a funny boy band song; and then they will come for you.

"Why Brexit will lead to more red tape, not less",0.125,Positive,"Putting the lead back in paint, the sewage back on beaches and enhancing the lethality of children's toys. These are just some of the 'opportunities'for deregulation offered in Sajid Javid's call for the public to propose ways to diverge from the EU rulebook. Slashing European regulation has long been an article of faith for the Tory party, fulfilling both its Thatcherite and Europhobic instincts. No matter that recent history - from the global financial crisis to the tragedy at Grenfell Tower - has taught us that regulation is a public good to be protected, not an evil to be eradicated. Just like Boris Johnson, Javid has learned to live outside history, eschewing any responsibility for his party's decade in power. Brexit is presented as a fresh start for the country and the government. The idea of divergence is crucial to provide Brexit with a sense of purpose.  But the truth is Brexit will create a more bureaucratic state rather than a more agile one. The UK now needs to build its own regulatory functions in Whitehall to replace those that were delegated to Brussels. From medicines to chemicals to aviation, the UK will need to replicate European agencies, no matter the chancellor's ideological bent. Instead of sharing these regulatory functions with 27 other states, Britain will now need to shoulder the responsibility alone. Brexit will be a boon for British bureaucrats. Good regulation requires deep technical expertise. Neither the public, politicians nor commentators possess the expertise to judge whether medicines are safe or whether complex financial instruments pose a risk to economic stability. Brexit may have been the politics of the gut - the instinct that the country would be better off out - but it is only viable with a vast expansion in the number of technocrats. So what will these technocrats do? The fundamental error is to think that less burdensome regulation means a lower regulatory burden. In practice it means two sets of regulation to replace one, if the UK and the EU operate with different standards and rules - even if they are lighter touch here than across the Channel. That means complexity goes up, not down. Moreover, product markets are increasingly global, not local. So any firm that wants to export into the European single market will need to match its regulatory requirements. Products will be produced to the highest standards, not the lowest. For any goods produced here that firms want to export, deregulation is merely a mirage. There are some areas where Britain could realistically deregulate, though none are desirable. It could erode workers' rights, lowering the cost of production. But we already have one of the most 'flexible'labour markets in the world - and many Brexit voters expect more protection not less. The UK could cut back on environmental standards, but this would be inconsistent with commitments under the Paris climate agreement. While financial regulation was given effect by an EU directive, this was based on the global Basel agreements: diverging from these would make the UK a pariah a little over a decade since the global financial crisis nearly tipped the world economy into a depression due to the sharp business practices of banks in the City of London as much as Wall Street. The Bank of England has always been a more important financial regulator than the European commission. The truth is that Britain's economic problems are the result of a failed free-market model. The path to success lies in a more active and entrepreneurial state that works in partnership with business and unions to raise productivity and unleash innovation. Our problems are of our own making. Only in the delusions of Brexit fantasists is putting the lead back in paint the way to put the great back in Great Britain.

The directive underlines the degree to which Downing Street is determined that everyone in the department follows its ideological lead in using language that frames Britain's departure from the European Union as a clean break. The memo's opening sentence says 'Brexit is completed. So do not use the term 'òBrexit', save as a historical event that took place on 31 January 2020'ù. It then advises 'use 'òtransition period' not 'òimplementation period'.'The directive continues: 'On 31 December 2020 we will either leave the transition period with a Canada-style free trade agreement' or the 'ò2019 deal' which will give us a trading relationship with the EU like Australia's'ù. They were told: 'Do not use phrases such as 'òdeal/no deal'.'Diplomats have also been urged to stress that 'the UK's priority in the negotiations is to ensure that we restore our economic and political independence on 1 January 2021. That is the government's primary objective. If asked to expand, we will ensure that we will have the right to regulate and are not constrained by EU law or the court of justice of the European Union.'Other words that are frowned upon in the guidance include 'ambitious'ù, 'unique'ù, 'deep'ù, 'bespoke'or 'anything else that can be taken to mean anything other than a typical free trade agreement of the Canada type'ù. It adds: 'If hyperbole is absolutely essential, only make reference to a deal 'at least as good as [Canada's deal with the EU]'ù. Another word now banned inside the Foreign Office is 'partnership'in connection with the future relationship with Europe, still less 'deep'or 'special'partnership.

Shapeshifter? World King? The PM could be seriously unwell,0.25,Positive,"O brave new world, that has such people in't! Day Three in the Big Brexit house, and Mr Johnson bigly regrets that, despite there being two rows of empty seats in the media section, there is absolutely no room in the Painted Hall of the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich for the Guardian's sketch-writer. It's nothing personal. Absolutely not. It's a total coincidence that the sketch-writer for the Times has been allowed in. Try to think of it this way, Boris explained. Basically he was doing me a favour. Because what would be the point of making me sit through another half hour speech that would be full of half-truths, evasions and outright lies, when I could just as easily watch the charade on TV? Save me the effort of having to queue up to go through security and hang out with a few sycophantic cabinet ministers, half-witted ambassadors and naive business leaders. Wasters, the lot of them. Hell, he'd have been doing the speech via his Facebook page from a cupboard inside No 10 given the choice. Just as he had on Friday night with his uninterested three minute ramble to the nation when he had wanted to get on with the real business of knocking back a £350 bottle of wine with the Brexit establishment elite. But Dominic Cummings had told him that this time he needed to throw on a suit and turn up in person. And what Classic Dom wants, Classic Dom gets. And after Boris appeared from behind a screen that completely blanked out the grandeur of the setting - on TV he looked as if he could have been almost anywhere - it soon emerged that for once he had been telling the truth. Because he only had eccentric hand gestures and interpretative dance on offer. There never had been a grand plan to lead us to the Brexit promised land. Brexit had only ever been an end in itself. A narcissistic indulgence for both himself and the country. Now he was expected to deliver, he had a very vague outline of what might come next. 'If we get it right,'he began. This was one hell of an if. If we - typical of Boris to try to get the rest of us to share the blame for his own actions - got it right, then everything might be more or less OK. A bit worse than it might otherwise have been, but hopefully not so much as anyone would notice. He didn't think to explain what might happen if we didn't get it right. Best not to go there. So here's what was going to happen. Possibly, maybe. First everyone was going to stop saying the B word. Brexit was done, even if it wasn't, and anyone overheard talking about it would be rounded up and sent to re-education camps. So no more B word. Ever. And no more saying that we didn't have a deal. Because we did have a deal. A deal called the withdrawal agreement, which didn't include any kind of deal. At this point, it started to dawn on most people that the prime minister could be seriously unwell. A man so out of touch with honesty and integrity that he is now incapable of differentiating between truth and lies. A shapeshifter for whom reality is an ever moving target. The World King who demands loyalty to cover up his neediness and inadequacy. Free trade was being choked, he insisted. The time for protectionism was over. Britain need to lead the world into a new era of mercantilism. One that could only be achieved by having a Canada-style deal with the EU that put up countless tariff and other barriers to free trade. It was full on deranged, but in the front row Liz Truss could only enthusiastically applaud. Boris barely acknowledged her. She would be reshuffled into deserved obscurity within a week. Boris had only just started, though. There was to be no talk of a no-deal Brexit. From now on, no deal would simply be referred to as the Australian model. In that no Australian trade deal with the EU actually existed. It was pure genius. Boris could eliminate cancer from the world merely by renaming it. Why had no one thought of that before? This was the kind of innovation that was going to put the Little back into Great Britain. Nor would we be bothering to align with the EU, because the EU was basically a bit shit. Who wanted to follow pointless directives on straight bananas when we could be our own banana republic? Besides, the EU shouldn't nit-pick. It was obvious that the UK was trustworthy, said the proven liar. If something was obviously the right thing to do there was no need to have it enshrined in law. To take the lead, he was proposing to make murder legal on the grounds that everyone knew it was wrong. Several more members of the cabinet rose to give Boris an ovation. There were no questions about Brexit at the end. Boris had made his position only too clear: the only plan in town was to blame the EU if the negotiations failed. Instead, Johnson found himself explaining why the Conservative government of the past 10 years hadn't in fact been in government at all and that the Streatham terror attack was all someone else's fault. Over in the Commons, Dominic Raab was at pains to say that the government would protect the rights of journalists. Which was good to know. Perhaps he will now be able to explain why I was excluded from Greenwich and other reporters were banned from a lobby briefing. It looks as if the government is hell-bent on imposing the same tariff barriers to free speech as it is to free trade. ",0.625,Positive
The Guardian view on Brexit trade talks: to diverge or not to diverge,-0.125,Negative,"Boris Johnson got not one but two wins last year on Brexit: a fresh withdrawal agreement with the European Union and an election victory that gave him an 80-seat majority in parliament. But while these events matter quite a bit for Mr Johnson and his political future, they did not make much of an impact on the British economy. Mr Johnson's premiership rests on the nostalgia of Brexit; its true believers think they were better off in an imagined past, before Britain joined the European Community. They will keep backing the prime minister because he says that the trappings of that past can be restored, even without any economic benefit. That explains why a big part of the story of Brexit is about fishing, farming and factories. Before the UK joined the common market, manufacturing employed about a third of the workforce. That figure has now shrunk to less than a tenth. Farmers and fishermen, who voted enthusiastically for Brexit, make up a tiny proportion of national income - 0.6% and less than 0.1% respectively. Almost all of the rest of us are working in the service sector - which takes in everything from law firms and media companies to cabs and hairdressing. Work has become more precarious, but disposable income, in real terms, is roughly double what it was before we entered Europe. There are good reasons to aim to recover a bigger manufacturing base in this country and to develop a different, more sustainable agricultural base in a world of industrialised farming, but it is hard to see how such things will be achieved by failing to negotiate a trading relationship with the EU. Brexit does not occur in a vacuum: the global multilateral trading system is showing signs of stress on several fronts, notably the failure to conclude the Doha round of trade talks and a lack of progress in critical areas such as services, agricultural subsidies and digital trade. It would be better for all concerned if Brexit was a temporary glitch rather than part of the new normal. Once Britain is out of the EU's single market and customs union there will be winners and losers in the economy. There is a trade-off between access to EU markets and how close to its rules we stick. Barriers to the movement of goods and services between Britain and the EU may not just be at the border of the single market - for example, with tariffs imposed, but also behind the border, where standards and rules of origin have to be met. If Britain were to end up in a similar position to Australia, with no deal with the EU, the Treasury has calculated that GDP would shrink by 7.7%. Mr Johnson would be wise to take up the offer from Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, of a roadmap to a workable and durable free trade deal, which would be the central pillar of this country's partnership with the continent. It is important to note that since trade talks don't begin until March, a lot of what was said on Monday ought to carry a health warning that politics coloured its delivery. Mr Barnier said he wanted a 'robust commitment towards a level playing field, and the necessary enforcement regime'as well as long-term assurances on fishing. Mr Johnson said that he will maintain the 'highest standards in these areas'and EU boats could access UK waters in a system that would be reviewed, as it is now, yearly. The gap between the UK and EU, keen-eyed observers said, was smaller than the rhetoric implied. It would be best if the divide was kept as narrow as possible. ",-0.875,Negative
Brexit: where do the EU and UK stand before talks begin?,-0.125,Negative,"The UK left the European Union on Friday night. On Monday morning, the two sides began the arduous task of reconstructing a 47-year-old relationship based on trade, security, foreign policy and numerous technical policies. Michel Barnier, returning as EU chief negotiator, published the EU's draft negotiating objectives, declaring them 'nothing surprising'ù, as they repeated the EU's long-stated principles. Less than an hour later, Boris Johnson began setting out the UK's opening position, with a very different vision. A quick glance at both texts - the EU one here and the UK's here - shows how much divides the two sides at the opening stage of talks, which are due to conclude by October, meaning the UK will exit the transition period on 31 December 2020. The EU has said the UK can have a zero-tariff, zero-quota, free trade agreement in exchange for 'zero-dumping'ù, ie maintaining EU standards on workers' rights, environmental protection and state aid. Barnier told journalists that Johnson agreed this point, when the prime minister signed the political declaration in October 2019, which states that 'the future relationship must ensure open and fair competition, encompassing robust commitments to ensure a level playing field'ù. Barnier said there could not be 'any surprise on the British side to hear that, if we are acting in good faith here'ù. But the UK government statement on negotiating objectives appears to spurn the agreement Johnson signed with EU leaders last October. 'There is no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policies, subsidies, social protection, the environment or anything similar, any more than the EU should be obliged to accept UK rules,'it said. The EU envisages a limited agreement on services, covering telecoms, postal services and environmental services. The EU has said it will not negotiate on whether British-based financial firms can access EU markets, but will make a unilateral decision as to whether the sectors meet EU standards (an 'equivalence'decision). Ireland's prime minister, Leo Varadkar, warned last week that British banks' access to EU markets would be tied to an agreement on fishing. The government wants more ambitious arrangements for the City of London: it has called for a 'predictable, transparent, and business-friendly environment for financial services firms'- a request at odds with EU equivalence that can be withdrawn at short notice. In contrast to the EU's politicised linking of fish with financial services, the government states that the EU's decision to grant equivalence should be 'technical and confirmatory'ù, reflecting the reality that the UK will be operating under the same regulations. Fishing might be a tiny part of the overall economic relationship between the EU and UK but is likely to cause one of the biggest rows. The EU wants its fishing crews to maintain current levels of access to British waters with stable quotas. Barnier said a deal on fisheries would be 'inextricably linked'to the trade agreement. EU officials have also tied the UK's ability to sell seafood into the EU market to continued access to British fishing waters for European boats. Johnson is adamant that any new agreement should be based on the principle that 'British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats'ù. The UK government also stresses that the UK will be 'an independent coastal state by the end of 2020 and any agreement must reflect this reality'ù. The future role of the European court of justice is ambiguous in the EU's opening position, which has contributed to negative headlines in the UK. The EU has said only the European court of justice can arbitrate on questions of European law, but has not spelled out any process for deciding what is a European law question, or whether it considers the Luxembourg court should be responsible for settling disputes in the future relationship between the EU and UK. Barnier said the ECJ 'should be able to continue its role in full'concerning security issues, such as extradition and data-sharing. Downing Street insists there is no need for ECJ oversight of its trade deal, while the government has also said that any security agreement with the EU 'must not constrain the autonomy of the UK's legal system in any way'ù. The EU has also said future co-operation in security must rest on the UK's continued membership of the European convention on human rights, the 1950 treaty that set up the European court of human rights, whose members span Albania to Ukraine. While the government has not proposed quitting the ECHR, the Strasbourg court is unpopular with Conservative Eurosceptics and Johnson's righthand man, Dominic Cummings, called for a referendum on the ECHR before he joined the government. As long trailed, the EU has said the future relationship deal will not cover Gibraltar, a British overseas territory since 1713, claimed by Spain. The EU and UK could reach separate agreements on Gibraltar, but this will require approval from Madrid - a role reversal from the time when Spain, seeking to enter the European Economic Community in the 1980s, had to accept the status quo on Gibraltar. The government does not accept Gibraltar's exclusion from the deal: it states it will 'be acting on behalf of the UK crown dependencies and overseas territories: the whole UK family'ù. Both sides say they will be ready to discuss the UK's participation in EU programmes, such as research and the Erasmus student exchange. The two sides also agree that these discussions can only take place once the EU has agreed its next seven-year budget (2021-27) - a politically fraught task that shows no sign of imminent resolution among the EU's 27 member states. They also agree the talks could end without a free-trade deal. Barnier warned that 'if we can't manage a deal by the end of the year there will be a cliff-edge on many fronts'ù, naming trade in goods and fisheries. While Johnson said it was 'emphatically not 'òdeal or no deal''ù, he also said the UK could accept a looser, Australian-style arrangement with the EU. Australia has limited agreements with the EU and mostly trades on World Trade Organization terms, although Canberra is seeking a free-trade agreement. ",-0.375,Negative
"UK wildlife at risk due to regulatory gaps created by Brexit, says report",-0.125,Negative,"Hedgehogs, dragonflies and bees are among wildlife at risk due to big gaps in environmental protections following the UK's departure from the EU, according to a new report. Commissioned by The Wildlife Trusts, The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and WWF, the study claims the UK faces losing regulations preventing hedgerows being cut during the nesting season and vital buffer strips from being ploughed or sprayed with pesticides. Other regulations currently based in EU law, which safeguard ponds and protect carbon-locking bare soils from draining or blowing away, could also be lost, according to the report by the Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP). The agriculture bill, set to be debated in the House of Commons on Monday, will see payment for the amount of land farmed replaced by a 'public money for public goods'system whereby land managers are paid to protect wildlife, the environment and carbon storage. While broadly welcomed by campaigners, they fear the new bill does not go far enough. As farmers lose direct payments under the common agricultural policy, critics say some EU regulations could also fall away. These include specific protections for hedgerows, not cutting them during the breeding seasons and maintaining a buffer strip at their base to protect plants and safeguard species including yellowhammers, small mammals, pollinator insects and pond-dwelling amphibians. As the bill stands, there are no domestic regulations to replace them, and nothing to indicate how any regulations, current and future, will be enforced, say critics. The reports said a new system of regulation is needed. The three wildlife charities want the new Office for Environmental Protection (OEP), which replaces European oversight of environmental protections, to have powers to police and implement regulations, and all farmers to comply irrespective of whether they receive public funding. Ellie Brodie, from The Wildlife Trusts, said: 'We're really concerned that the agriculture bill does not contain the regulation that's so desperately needed and nature will continue to take the rap.''Gaps must be filled and enforcement must be strengthened if we're to address the nature crisis and climate emergency.'Tom Lancaster, of the RSPB, said: 'The agriculture bill includes vital new powers to pay farmers to restore nature, but is silent on the rules and regulations for farming in the future. With the change that Brexit will bring, this presents real risks to our soils and hedgerows, and the nature that depends on them.'Debbie Tripley, of the WWF, said: 'Unless the government starts plugging the gaps left by EU regulation, our soils, hedgerows and the wildlife that depends on them are at risk'ù. A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said: 'We will continue to be a world leader on the environment as we leave the EU and both the agriculture bill and the environment bill are a crucial part of that. 'We will not lower the exceptionally high environmental standards we already hold. In fact, leaving the EU means we can transform British agriculture to reward farmers for enhancing the environment, tackling climate change and protecting our wildlife for future generations.'",-0.25,Negative
Does Brexit really bring economic reasons to be cheerful?,0.625,Positive,"Is Larry Elliott the only economist apart from Patrick Minford who believes we are better off outside the EU (Why there are many reasons to be cheerful, 1 February)? His attempt to defend such a calamitous and damaging act flies in the face of virtually all respected expert analysis. Being part of the EU has civilised this country in a way that would have been otherwise unthinkable. Workers' rights, environmental protection, social and regional development immediately come to mind. Does he truly believe a government led by Boris Johnson is going to unleash allegedly hidden potential and end the north-south divide by loosening state aid rules and taking other measures? More likely we'll end up as the 51st US state or worse.  In any case, Europe is about much more than trade deals and economic performance - it has been the most successful peace project in history, bringing countries and peoples together in a way that was inconceivable in the immediate aftermath of the second world war. Of course, the EU is not perfect but it is far better to be on the inside, making it work better.Emeritus professor David HunterRichmond, North Yorkshire '¢ Larry Elliott writes that 'the UK is one of the world leaders in artificial intelligence and could seize a competitive advantage once it can set its own regulations'ù. The old illusions are starting to come back. Since the 1950s how many wonderful examples of Britain leading the world have crashed because there was no economic machinery behind them? The world leadership in jet transport is all gone. The first computer was built in Manchester, but where is our computer industry? The first nuclear power station was at Calder Hall. Now the French and Chinese are building our next one. It will be the same for all the wonderous advantages of artificial intelligence. We may be at the point of progress at this moment, but without an economic clout behind it we will see the field taken over by the Americans, the Chinese and probably the Europeans. As members of the EU we could have led the way with 28 modern economies and a 500 million-population market behind us. With us as members the EU could have 'seized the competitive advantage and set its own regulations'ù. But alone we can't.

Common market but no common ground,0,Neutral,"Gisela Stuart is mistaken when she says Britain started to drift away from the EU when political union became a major issue (This was a divorce long in the making, Journal, 1 February). Her recollection is that this was not part of our original conditions of membership, but she is incorrect. Harold Wilson referred to the opportunity for political unity as early as 2 May 1967 (my source is Medium.com, which in turn quotes Hansard). Meanwhile, the Ideas on Europe website references a government pamphlet from 1975 about why it wanted to remain, including the wish to have a 'say in the future economic and political development of the common market'ù. The strange thing isn't that we joined in the first place. The strange thing is that leave made such an iconic success of such a claim that had no basis in fact - and went ahead and won anyway.Guy ClappertonLondon '¢ Gisela Stuart argues that people voted to leave the EU for reasons of 'community, identity and belonging'rather than on economic grounds. She is quite right. Likewise, the core of the remain case was built on precisely the same principles, as Ian McEwan so elegantly expounds in the same Guardian issue. The fundamental gap between leavers and remainers will always be unbridgeable because the two sides have antithetical views about the very meaning of being European. Even if the post-Brexit British economy flourishes as never before that will not diminish by one whit the ethical and philosophical case for us to get back into the EU at the earliest opportunity.Robin WendtChester '¢ Gisela Stuart is entitled to her opinion, and hats off to the Guardian for allowing her the space to express it. She does, however, abuse your hospitality by playing fast and loose with the English language. When 'we'joined the common market in 1973, she was not yet one of 'us'but still a German national.

Labour's task is to convince people that Britain's future outside the EU is still European,0,Neutral,"Much of the media has spent the last week reliving the 2016 referendum, grieving or celebrating accordingly. Those of us concerned with social justice cannot afford to look backwards, not when decades of progress - across protections at work, for the environment, and for equal treatment of all people - are at stake. This government is leaving the EU on the hardest terms, and our hard-won rights may not survive a deal with Donald Trump's US. I hate where we have ended up: a reckless government willing to risk jobs, our security and trash the cooperation of the past 50 years; a future that looks precarious for many, particularly for working people across the country whose jobs depend on EU trade. But we still have a choice. The battles of the past four years must end. Labour must get on the front foot and shape an alternative vision for Britain that sets out a better future. We have to go out and win the argument that our future is European. Close cooperation is possible outside the EU - and it is necessary. For all the talk of trade deals with other countries, our businesses trade with the EU and that's not going to stop. We have to make and win this argument in the country - especially in those areas where the leave vote was highest and where the local economy depends on trade with the EU. If there is a lesson to be learned from the devastating referendum defeat, it is that arguments behind the dispatch box will not cut it. We need to go out, arm our activists with the knowledge they need, and win this argument in workplaces, pubs and town halls across the UK. We need to take on the challenges the Tory government is creating - and answer them. How will we remain competitive in a world where we trade with countries whose businesses can cut corners on how they treat their workers and the damage they do to the planet, when we shouldn't be allowing UK businesses to do the same? The answer is to invest in the biggest asset we have - our people. The great protection for our car industry in the north-east against a hard Brexit is the skills that exist in that region, which are second to none, and not found in such great numbers anywhere else. The answer is education, education, education - in every part of the UK. Investing in our people is now central to the UK's survival. This is about lifelong learning as well as a huge investment in our young people. And we should bring this attitude and innovation to trade. The bilateral trade deals that the Tories fantasise about are clunky, built for a different era and disadvantage the UK. But our services exports are almost twice the value of goods exports. We need to look at how we can capture the fast growth of trade in services, including through digitisation. This is where our strength already lies. Not in a race to the bottom to provide ever cheaper goods. We have the right base to build on in every part of this country: the reward for a history of ingenuity, entrepreneurship and facing down adversity. Britain is home to world-class education, and a rich and vibrant culture that attracts people from all over the world. From Grimsby and Aberdeen where wind energy is the basis of a thriving economy, to Barrow and Fife where shipbuilding is world-class, we should be making more of our assets and take advantage of the areas where our skills lie. National government has a role in backing those industries to succeed, and backing universities to stay world-class. But to realise this strength we need a political system that can see that such assets and potential must be protected, not just left to the whim of the market alone. For too long our nations and regions have been treated as a problem to be solved. Decisions have been made by a small group of men in London and the south-east. We have piled investment into places that are already pulling ahead to improve productivity and it has left us lagging. One solution is greater devolution. But simple federalism will not do. The change must be much more profound - real power, in people's hands. It is only on that basis that we can pull together to build a better future. But this means sticking to our values. We should not be doing trade deals with countries that do not sign the Paris climate agreement. We should call out those who do not make a contribution. To stop exploitation and tax evasion. To require companies to pay the living wage. To level the playing field in ways big and small - whether we are talking about large companies able to game the system on tax or business rates. I was born in the decade the UK joined the European Economic Community. For all its imperfections, the European ideal is one that has lifted working people up together and provided Britain with more than half a century of peace. The past few years have taught us that progress is not inevitable. Whatever you value, whatever you want, you have to go out and fight for it. Now is that moment.

I marked the moment of Britain's exit from the EU surrounded by mates. As they made optimistic noises about Labour's chances next time around, without Brexit on the horizon to scupper the left's electoral coalition, I sulked and gulped down my cheap pinot. It's true that the bloody borders of Fortress Europe - detention centres, misery at Calais, the transformation of the Mediterranean into a mass grave - are a stain on our high-minded liberal values of tolerance and openness. But losing reciprocal freedom of movement for Brits and EU nationals is still a bitter pill. And it's not going to make conditions for non-EU migrants any better either.

When my children were born, their citizenship entitled them to live, work and study freely across much of Europe. This is no longer the case. After putting my children to bed, I went to a Canadian friend's birthday party. The guests were a mix of Canadians, British, French, Germans and Americans.

I fear the growing nastiness that Brexit is ushering in,-0.875,Negative,"At the beginning of January, a few weeks before the UK's departure from the European Union, I had a conversation with a black relative who never talks about race. And when I say never, I mean never. She is the type of voter whom the Conservative party would largely regard as one of their traditional supporters: an older, affluent member of the professional class, who believes that any amount of racial discrimination can be overcome through focus and hard work. She was the one who brought up the subject, and her voice carried an unusual level of distress. She had gone into work one morning, where she has a senior role, and as she walked past reception a couple of the youngest staff members there called over to her, since one of them had an enquiry for her. When you go back to Africa to see your family, they asked, do you all live in those mud huts with the thatched roofs? She talked about the tone with which her colleagues spoke, the clear mockery, the wink-wink association of blackness with a certain lack of 'civilisation'ù. We don't really discuss politics, and so I was surprised when she drew a direct link between their comments and the arrival of Brexit. People feel that they can say these things now, she said. I live in Germany, and have done since 2014. Though it is no racial utopia, it is a country where I have made a fulfilling new life and met some of my very best friends. One of the reasons I left England was that I had grown weary of the racism that people of colour can never fully escape, no matter what they achieve there. I was tired of just brushing it off. Look at these headlines, I told my family members. Look at the way they talk about immigrants, like we are dirt they are trying to scrape from their shoes. We came here as refugees, we kept our heads down, we worked hard and they still hate us. The older I get, the less I dismiss racist remarks as mere ignorance. I used to do that, but seeing the devastation of people you love hardens the heart. Now I regard so-called 'ignorant'comments as a threat. I do not believe those colleagues were open to dialogue with my relative. They were trying to put that uppity black woman back in her place and, judging by the look in her eyes as she told me the story, they succeeded. My family and I don't discuss the referendum result very much. Several of them, dissatisfied with the state of things in the country, voted to leave the EU. A few months later, one of them told me with sadness that many of her Polish friends had gone back to mainland Europe. They had done so not because of the uncertainty over their jobs that Brexit had created, but because they felt unwelcome. I gently told my relative that I was very worried Brexit was not the answer to the questions she was asking of modern Britain. I told her gently because although I voted to remain, I am not, as a wealthy Brexiter barked in my direction recently, a remainer. It is not a tribal identity that I have taken up in response to the xenophobic rants of Nigel Farage - who, I am desperately assured, does not represent our country, but whose sentiments were alive and well in the mouths of those work colleagues. It is a political position I took because I think it is a glorious and beautiful right to get up and move to a place where you might find greater happiness or safety. I took it because my suspicion, later confirmed by data, was that the leave vote was far too tainted by a hostility towards people of colour. It didn't surprise me that, when the remain campaign made its case in 2016, it focused so little upon the happiness that its citizens could find abroad. That's because the country of my birth doesn't really care about immigrants; we are useful as economic units and little more. Several of my British friends here in Germany, disgusted by the post-referendum fallout, have said they will never return to live there. That's why, as the UK prepares to leave the EU, I feel sorry. Not for myself; though I have taken a financial hit, I will find my way somehow. I feel sorry for those younger people who will not be able to get up and go with the same ease I did, to live and to befriend and to love. Finally, I feel sorry for my elderly relative, who in her later years has to endure a growing nastiness in the land to which she has given so much. She doesn't deserve that: but it is her reality, and unfortunately I think it is our future. '¢ Musa Okwonga is a poet, journalist and musician ",-1.75,Negative
Keir Starmer: Labour should argue for return of free movement,0,Neutral,"Sir Keir Starmer has said he would argue for the reintroduction of EU free movement after Brexit, if he becomes Labour's next leader. The shadow Brexit secretary said his party must not be afraid to argue for free movement, and that EU citizens should receive 'rights, not tolerance'from the UK. 'We need to make the wider case on immigration,'he said, speaking at a leadership event at Westminster Cathedral in London. 'We welcome migrants, we don't scapegoat them. Low wages, poor housing, poor public services, are not the fault of people who come here: they're political failure. So we have to make the case for the benefits of migration; for the benefits of free movement. 'I want people in this country to be able to go and work abroad, in Europe; and I want people in Europe to be able to come and work here. I want families to be able to live together - whether that's in Europe, or here.'Asked whether that meant he would argue for free movement to be restored, he replied: 'Of course: bring back, argue for, challenge.'Freedom of movement will formally end when the UK leaves the EU on Friday evening - though the accompanying rights will be retained during the transition period, which is due to end on 31 December. Starmer appeared to be arguing for a new, but similar, arrangement to be negotiated reciprocally, as part of negotiations about the UK's future relationship with the EU27. By contrast, Boris Johnson's government plans to introduce a points-based migration regime that would no longer give EU citizens a free pass. Speaking on Brexit day, Starmer urged his colleagues, some of whom have been ardent remainers, to 'let go'ù. 'We leave the EU tonight, and the leave/remain divide goes with it. That divide has cut across families, communities, regions, the country. And we need to let that divide go. Leave/remain ends tonight, and that includes for the Labour party.'Starmer appears to be the frontrunner in the Labour leadership race, with 85 nominations from constituency Labour parties (CLPs) so far, against 44 for Rebecca Long-Bailey and 18 for Lisa Nandy. Asked whether Labour's policy of supporting a referendum, which he was instrumental in pushing the party to adopt, had damaged its electoral prospects, he said there were many reasons for December's election result. 'Brexit of course was among them. But the argument that Brexit alone was the reason - and we would have soared to victory untroubled, without Brexit - is just plain wrong,'he insisted, adding that the public had lost trust in Labour as 'a force for good'ù. He denied it had been a mistake for Labour not to back Theresa May's Brexit deal, which could have meant a closer economic relationship than that Johnson is expected to negotiate. 'Theresa May's deal was a bad deal. It didn't protect trade union rights, workplace rights, environmental rights, consumer rights. It was a bad deal which would lead to a very, very hard Brexit and we were right to oppose it. Let's not rewrite that. Let's not pretend that it was a good deal, somehow.'The first stage of the contest was for potential contenders to get the backing of 22 fellow MPs by 13 January. Five MPs passed this threshold: Keir Starmer (88 nominations),† Rebecca Long-Bailey (33), Lisa Nandy (31),
Jess Phillips (23) and Emily Thornberry (23). The second stage required each contender to win the support either of 33 constituency Labour parties (CLPs); or of three affiliates, two of which had to be unions, and which between them accounted for at least 5% of the affiliated membership. This had to be achieved before 14 February. Jess Phillips withdrew from the contest on 21 January. Emily Thornberry failed to attract the required number of members. The ballot of members and registered supporters was due to open on 21 February, and closes at noon on 2 April. To be eligible to vote you must have been a Labour member on 20 January, or have applied to have become a £25 registered supporter by 16 January. Corbyn's successor - Starmer, Long-Bailey or Nandy - will be announced at a special conference in London on 4 April. Starmer also criticised Johnson, saying he was the worst of the three Tory prime ministers he has seen since he became an MP in 2015. He described him as a man 'without any principle or anchor'ù. 'We don't give up on the fight for a close economic relationship which protects our jobs and our economy. We don't give up on the argument that we need to collaborate and cooperate with our EU partners, on scientific research, medical research, arts, culture, education. We don't give up on the argument on security either,'he said. 'We need to give our EU citizens rights, not tolerance: and that starts with the right to vote.'",0,Neutral
"After Brexit, Britain's hard line on immigration won't hold",-1,Negative,"Brexit will be 'done'by 31 January, except little will change. What the Brexiteers have mistaken for a single moment will in reality be a lengthy and painful process. In most policy areas shaped by EU influence, post-Brexit changes will be slow and incremental. There is, however, one exception to this rule: immigration. After 1 January 2021, free movement will end and EU and non-EU citizens wishing to move to the UK will (unless they are Irish citizens) be treated the same. Despite this shake-up, it's still unclear what Britain's new immigration system will look like. When Boris Johnson and Priti Patel promised an 'Australian-style points system'last year, their plans were largely vacuous. The Conservative government subsequently commissioned the independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to advise on the shape that Britain's future immigration system should take. Johnson and Patel probably didn't expect the MAC's outgoing chair, Professor Alan Manning, to dismiss talk of their Australian-style points system as, aptly, 'pointless'ù. For good measure, the report also notes that the UK has far more to learn from Austria - where skilled migrants are generally required to have a job offer - than it does from Australia, where many are not. Whether or not the MAC recommendations are adopted in full, big changes are on the way. Theresa May's 2018 white paper recommended a salary threshold of £30,000 for skilled migrants with a job offer. Businesses - in sectors such as fashion, technology and research, all of which employ EU nationals who, while far from unskilled, earn less than £30,000 - argued for a reduced threshold of £20,000 or £22,000. The MAC report has split the difference, proposing a £25,600 threshold, higher in some better-paid occupations, with special rules applying to NHS and education sectors. Crucially, the report also argues that if the government really wants to adopt a 'points-based system'for the most highly skilled migrants, it will need to be far more flexible about the sorts of people it admits - and recognise that not everyone who arrives in Britain will succeed, at least not necessarily in material terms. These proposals should please businesses, although some in lower-paying sectors such as hospitality and food processing, especially outside London, will still face a big shock. The NHS should be able to live with the new arrangements, which essentially say that not just doctors and nurses, but people working in lower-paid positions, will be eligible under the new rules. It will be far harder for social care to adapt to the changes, where the MAC - as it did in its last major report - argues that the problem is that care workers aren't paid enough because the care system has been persistently underfunded and that the government shouldn't use immigration as a way of dodging these issues. Their point is valid but it will be of little comfort to those who rely on Britain's care system now. All this will amount to rapid change. There will need to be consultation, particularly with employers, if not on the big decisions then on a host of second-order questions; and then there will need to be time for business to get used to the new system, which will be considerably more costly and burdensome than freedom of movement. For many employers that depend on immigrant workers from the EU, and therefore don't need to interact with the immigration system at all under the current arrangements, this is not simply a matter of extending and tweaking existing processes and procedures. Businesses (particularly small ones) will suddenly find there are Home Office forms to fill in, fees to pay, and time-consuming bureaucracy to navigate. Time is short - by the summer, employers will want to know what to say when making job offers to EU nationals. The most important immediate impact of Brexit for business will be lots more red tape. So will post-Brexit Britain, without free movement, become closed to all except the 'brightest and best'ù, vindicating Brexiteers who voted to restrict immigration and slow the pace of demographic and social change? Or will we move into a new era, in which global Britain will benefit from skills and talent from all over the world, rather than simply sucking in cheap labour from the rest of Europe? The answer is likely to be somewhere in between. What is certain is that these proposals are far more liberal than anything we could have expected from Theresa May. Immigration-bashers and nativists in the Conservative party and beyond will find this uncomfortable - particularly the resulting increase in immigration from outside the EU. But immigration is a less salient issue among the electorate than it was in 2016, and public perceptions of the economic and social impact of immigration on the UK are far more positive than they were at the time of the referendum. For some people, at least, ending freedom of movement - and hence restoring 'control'over immigration - may be more important than guaranteeing lower numbers of migrants. So there are grounds for at least cautious optimism. Contrary to the hopes and fears of many, Brexit looks less like it will make a decisive turn towards restricting immigration. Instead, consistent with the more benign aspects of our history, it may signal a different form of openness.

Brexit party MEP drafts two contrasting messages on Brussels vote,0.125,Positive,"The message from the Brexit party MEP John Tennant could hardly have been clearer: Boris Johnson's departure deal is 'a trap'and must be voted down at all costs. But within a few paragraphs the tone changes. 'It's still a Brexit of sorts,'Tennant writes, now saying he will reluctantly support it. A leaked email that Tennant sent to aides this week appears to show two versions of a script for a video message to be released after the European parliament's vote on the Brexit deal on Wednesday. The leak highlights the dilemma facing Nigel Farage's party before what is likely to be the last significant political moment of its brief and tumultuous existence. In the first version of the script, Tennant, one of 29 Brexit party MEPs elected in May, argues for opposing the planned deal and holding out instead for a no-deal departure. 'This deal isn't worth the paper it's written on. It's a trap,'he writes. 'I know we probably don't have the votes to vote this deal down, but if it did fall there would once again be a slim chance of a genuine clean-break Brexit on 31 January. 'It's like we're a goal down, sending the keeper up in the 93rd minute for a corner kick. There's not much chance of it succeeding but we've got to try. Call it my last stand, call it Brexit's last stand, but I've got to at least try to vote it down.'The next script is still deeply sceptical of the plan, calling it 'the second worst deal in history'- second only to Theresa May's version - before abruptly changing tack. 'But here's the thing,'Tennant writes. 'It's still better than not leaving this hideous place at all. We will - mostly - get back control of our borders. We'll get our own independent trade policy back. We'll stop giving the EU billions of our hard-earned cash. That has to still count for something. 'It's still a Brexit of sorts. However bad the deal is, I couldn't in all conscience vote against Brexit. How could I deny reality and jeopardise the only Brexit that's still reasonably possible at this stage?'The two-script approach echoes Johnson himself, who famously drafted two newspaper columns, one pro-Brexit and one supporting remain, before opting to pick the leave side. A Liberal Democrat source said: 'The Brexit party have been on somewhat of a learning curve this week, from discovering that leaving the EU means losing our seat at the table to now their indecision on whether to even back the Brexit bill. Like Boris Johnson and his two letters, it's clear they can't have ever had the country's interests at heart.'Farage began the general election campaign insisting he could only back a no-deal Brexit, but then stood down candidates in 317 Conservative-held seats, saying he had been reassured by Johnson's pledges over the departure. A week before the election, three Brexit party MEPs switched to the Conservatives, saying only Johnson could deliver Brexit. A Brexit party spokesman said Tennant had simply been 'drafting ideas'in much the same way as Johnson did. 'There are good points and bad points to both choices, he still hasn't reached a conclusion, but will do before next week's vote,'the spokesman said. ",0.25,Positive
Boris Johnson's Brexit bill becomes law,0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson's Brexit deal has become law after it received royal assent from the Queen, having cleared all its stages in parliament. Tory MPs cheered the deputy speaker Nigel Evans as he confirmed in the House of Commons on Thursday that there was now a European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act. Johnson finally succeeded in getting his bill through the Commons and the Lords after several failed attempts by his predecessor Theresa May. He was not in the Commons to hear the news, but said the moment was a significant milestone. 'At times it felt like we would never cross the Brexit finish line, but we've done it,'he said. While the Tories cheered, the SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, registered his anger at the 'constitutional crisis'that passing a Brexit bill against the wishes of Scotland and other devolved nations had caused. 'We are faced with a situation which is completely unprecedented when the government in Edinburgh, Belfast and in Cardiff has not given consent to this act of parliament. That completely contravenes the devolution settlement that made it clear that the consent of the devolved administrations had to be given in bills of parliament that become acts of parliament that involve the devolved administrations,'he told MPs. 'We find ourselves here today, that our parliament has been ignored, our government has been ignored and, against the expressed wishes of the people of Scotland that voted in the referendum and reaffirmed the right of the people of Scotland to determine their own destiny, that that has been ignored.'The withdrawal agreement bill started its progress through the Commons just after Johnson won his 80-strong majority in December. It completed its passage through both chambers on Wednesday after the Lords backed down on four amendments that it had tried to secure earlier in the week. Peers voted for commitments on allowing child refugees to come to the UK and for EU citizens to get physical proof of their settled status, but MPs overturned the changes. The royal assent for the bill means the UK is set to leave the EU on 31 January, as long as the European parliament approves the deal as well. ",0,Neutral

"Johnson likely to end £30,000 immigration threshold post-Brexit",0.25,Positive,"Boris Johnson's new post-Brexit immigration regime is likely to mean an end to the controversial £30,000 salary floor for skilled workers, government sources have confirmed. The independent migration advisory committee (MAC) is expected to report shortly on whether the threshold should be retained. Downing Street will then spell out more details of an 'Australian-style points-based system'- of which salary is expected to form just one element. Government sources said it would be more 'nuanced'than an across-the-board salary floor. The £30,000 limit is currently applied to those seeking tier 2 visas - the main entry-route to the UK's labour market for skilled workers from non-EU countries. A lower limit of £20,800 is applied to younger workers. Ryan Shorthouse, director of Conservative thinktank Bright Blue, welcomed the suggestion that the threshold would be dropped. 'The £30,000 minimum salary threshold for tier 2 visas was unnecessarily and arbitrarily high. It would have strangled the pipeline of talented younger people at the start of their careers, especially in key economic sectors such as the NHS and the creative industries. And family visas only require a minimum salary threshold of £18,600 to be able to bring some family members to the UK,'he said. If the move is concerned, it would be the latest evidence that Johnson is keen to adopt a more liberal migration regime than his predecessor. The Conservative manifesto omitted the promise to cap net migration below 100,000 a year - a pledge that had shaped the party's policy since it was adopted by David Cameron in 2010. Responding to news that the £30,000 limit was likely to be dropped, the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said it showed that the UK economy needed a broad range of workers. 'We always said their plans were unworkable, as many employers in the private and public sector need what the government insists on calling 'òlow-skilled workers'. But all workers need decent pay, reasonable conditions, a right to a family life and trade union rights, wherever they are from. We will continue to fight for them,'she said. The MAC was asked by the government last June to examine the question of salary thresholds and how a points-based system might work. In 2018, it recommended the retention of salary thresholds. The threshold is already waived in some sectors, including in the NHS. ",1.125,Positive
"Changes to withdrawal bill threaten workers' rights, says Lisa Nandy",-0.125,Negative,"Workers' rights and protections for women could be under threat after Boris Johnson added a range of changes to the withdrawal agreement bill following the December general election, the Labour leadership contender Lisa Nandy has claimed. The MP for Wigan said a series of answers to parliamentary questions that she tabled showed key protections embedded in European court of justice case law could be ignored by the government. They include provisions for pregnant women, equal pay for men and women, and holiday pay. Nandy said: 'It is absolutely disgraceful that Boris Johnson wants to cast new doubt on rights for women at work that we have taken for granted for decades. 'The withdrawal agreement bill means women in Belfast will be protected permanently against discrimination at work, but women in Bolsover won't have the same guarantees from next year. That's completely unacceptable.'Nandy presented the government with a series of European court of justice judgments to check what their new status would be under the European withdrawal bill following the election. They included a key judgment from 1994 on equal pay that means employers who pay men more than women have to explain why the difference is not due to discrimination. Others included judgments from 2006 and 2011 that stopped the practice of rolling holiday pay into wages and employers refusing to pay allowances as part of paid leave. Judgments on pregnant women from 1990 and 1994, which ruled against employers refusing to employ women when they found out they were pregnant, were also included. The Brexit minister James Duddridge confirmed that 'each of the cases named in the parliamentary questions will be categorised as retained EU law'under the bill. Nandy claims this gives ministers a new power to tell lower courts dealing with routine cases that they can set aside EU case law when making judgments. This has led to fears that standards could be set at a lower level than current EU rules. Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, also confirmed that the legal obligation not to roll back EU law on discrimination against women in work applied only in Northern Ireland, not the rest of the UK. In a parliamentary question asking whether specific EU council directives on equal employment rights would apply to the whole of the UK, Smith replied that they applied to 'Northern Ireland only'ù. Downing Street has insisted that details on workers' rights would be contained in a new employment bill to ensure that the country was the 'best place in the world to work'and that they would not be watered down. A spokesperson for the prime minister said in December: 'Once Brexit is done, we will continue to lead the way and set a high standard, building on existing employment law with measures which protect those in low-paid work. 'This is on top of the largest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation that the government is bringing forward.'",-0.5,Negative
Business leaders urge government to publish aims for Brexit deal,0,Neutral,"The government must urgently publish its negotiating objectives for the next stage of Brexit talks, the Institute of Directors (IoD) has said, as it warned that business needs time to prepare for a new relationship with the EU by the end of the year. In a survey, the IoD found that directors are holding back on investment in business because of the continued uncertainty over Brexit. 'To give businesses any chance of being ready for the new relationship by the end of 2020, the government needs to be as clear as possible about what its intended destination is,'Allie Renison, the IoD's head of Europe and trade policy, said. 'With directors clear that negotiations with the EU are the priority right now, clarity is crucial for so many companies.' The IoD found that while businesses welcomed the certainty given by the withdrawal agreement struck by the prime minister in October, it was not enough to unlock investment and planning decisions. More than half of 952 directors surveyed (55%) said they would only be able to 'make planning and investment decisions'with certainty when 'we understand our future with the EU'ù. More than 60% of businesses said the EU deal was 'more important'to their business than a US deal with just 20% agreeing a deal with the US and other non-EU countries was 'important'to their businesses. The survey underlines the continued anxiety in the business sector over the future relationship with the EU. On Saturday Sajid Javid raised alarm bells when he warned that the UK would not be 'aligned'with EU rules after the trade talks, sparking fears of trade barriers where none currently exist. Business leaders warned this could lead to unwelcome friction on cross-border trade with consequences for investment, jobs and the economy. The IoD is now pressing the government to publish its negotiating goals urgently. Brussels expects to publish draft negotiating guidelines on 1 February with its goals agreed among member states at a meeting on 25 February. The commission is currently holding a series of seminars in Brussels with member state representatives on its goals in areas including fisheries, energy, transport and law enforcement. The future mobility of EU citizens was discussed on Monday while space, the European defence fund, cyber security were the topics on Friday. The prime minister is expected to set out his hopes in a major speech in the first half of February but so far there has been little to no parallel consultation with business to mirror what is going on in Brussels. European commission spokesman Eric Mamer warned on Monday that it could be March before formal talks can begin. 'We have said we will start negotiations as quickly as we can, but it will certainly not be before the end of February, beginning of March,'he said. 'This is not a slowing down or speeding up of the process. 'This is simply the nature of the institutional process and the consultations that need to take place before the negotiation directives can be formally adopted.'Renison added: 'Avoiding the chaotic uncertainty of leaving the EU without a deal is clearly a relief to business leaders, but they are still much more inclined to feel this Brexit deal on its own doesn't provide the certainty they need to invest and make plans for the future. 'Only clarity on the next phase of Brexit talks on trade and the wider economic relationship with the EU will resolve that uncertainty, particularly for Northern Ireland and trade within the UK itself.'",0,Neutral
"A judge, Lord Byron and a grave injustice",-0.125,Negative,"One of the many things I miss about my wife's late father, Ray, was his habit of phoning me up on a Sunday morning to say he'd enjoyed what I'd written in the Observer that weekend, before cheerfully pointing out its errors, factual and grammatical. A former typesetter and teacher of graphic design, Ray typically adopted a similar keen-eyed approach to what, towards the end, he guessed might be his impending funeral arrangements. He spent some of his last hospital days perfecting an order of service - Stan Kenton and Danny Boy and John Masefield - and the layout of his gravestone, with underlined instruction for its typeface: Bembo. We found versions of these instructions tucked in his glasses case and used as bookmarks and obviously did our best to keep to the letter of them, hearing his voice in our heads. I was reminded of Ray, reading about last week's ludicrous court case in which Judge Stephen Eyre QC, chancellor of the diocese of Lichfield, ruled that John Chadfield could not quote from Lord Byron's verse 'So we'll go no more a-roving'on his wife's memorial stone in a local churchyard. The grounds involved the idea that 'the passage from Byron is part of a secular poem which conveys no suggestion of Christian resurrection'ù. Chadfield was also prevented from using the phrase 'our boys'to describe the sons he and his wife of 51 years had raised, on the basis that it was 'overly personal'ù: 'It is important to bear in mind that the inscriptions will be read not just by those who knew the departed loved one but also by those who did not,'the judge noted. Isn't that justification enough for it to capture a flavour of who they were and what they loved? In one of our now rare family cinema outings, because my elder daughter is away at university, we managed to find an evening to see Greta Gerwig's fabulous Little Women last week. On the way home, there was debate about who was the most likable of the Marches - Jo or Beth or Meg or Amy. Spare a thought for the father, I suggested, who, having returned from the war, was confronted with several years' worth of high-octane sibling drama before he could take his boots off. Imagine the decibels. I was, inevitably, shouted down from all sides. I liked how John McPhee, a star of the New Yorker magazine for 55 years, last week decided to tie up some loose ends from his career. At 88, he acknowledged that plans for books he had carried around in his head for decades might not now get written, so he had written the stories in one-page versions. The exercise went some way to proving a long-held suspicion that hardly any nonfiction book isn't improved by being on a side of A4. In the excitable talk of Big Ben bongs, the entertainment for the hours leading up to the 11pm exit at Nigel Farage's Parliament Square party seems to have been neglected. Speaking on the radio, Richard Tice, Brexit's catalogue model, suggested that there would 'probably be a singalong'ù. He hadn't thought of a playlist. Is it not too late for Mark 'Frenchy'Francois to crowdfund for a supergroup? If memory serves, among those desperate to 'get it done'were Elaine Paige, Johnny Rotten and, inevitably, the exiled little Englander, Morrissey.

"If the UK doesn't act now, the car industry will vanish",0,Neutral,"Britain's economy is on course to grow by less than 1% in 2019. Last week's retail sales figures for December, which showed the longest period of zero growth for more than 20 years, are likely to drag down GDP growth in the last quarter, limiting the annual growth rate to 0.8% or 0.9% at best. In 2020, the economy's expansion may not be much better given all the uncertainty surrounding the government's negotiating stance with the EU following Brexit. Few people inside Whitehall or even the cabinet know which industries will be sacrificed to achieve a quick and dirty trade deal. And while that situation persists business investment will remain low and the manufacturing sector will stumble along, possibly in recession as it is now. Another year of lacklustre growth will bring the total number of lost years to 4.5 and mean that Britain has missed out on as much as 4% of GDP growth following the referendum result. One of the biggest losers from the Brexit debacle is the automotive sector, which was already struggling. On the surface, the UK car industry was humming in 2016 following a boom in diesel car sales, especially at the largest producer Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), and a new type of car leasing product that was cheap enough to allow middle- and low-income families to trade up from an ordinary family car to an expensive SUV. Domestic production and sales reached highs not seen this century and concerns about the over-production of cars disappeared over the horizon as quickly as a turbo-charged Ferrari. Then the diesel emissions scandal discredited a whole generation of cars. City mayors began to announce tough car emissions zones. And the leasing phenomenon, which accounted for nine out of 10 new car sales in 2017, began to peter out. Worse for the traditional manufacturers, the US electric carmaker Tesla announced the mass production of its Model 3. On the drawing board in 2016 and rolling off the production line in limited numbers only a year later, the Model 3 was Britain's third most popular new car in August last year. If the industry needed a sign that electric cars had arrived, this was it. Brexit and the threat of tariffs on cars and parts put a layer of uncertainty on an already difficult situation. Honda was the first to crumble, saying it would close its Swindon plant in 2021 and put its investment in a new generation of cars elsewhere. Most of the rest - Vauxhall (owned by the merged Peugeot Citro√´n and Fiat Chrysler), Ford, BMW and Renault/Nissan - have spent the intervening years scrambling to make electric cars that can compete with the Model 3. Unless they can find a way, almost the entire UK car industry could be wiped out by the end of this decade, leaving behind just the specialist makers such as Aston Martin, Rolls-Royce and Bentley along with a few upmarket marques from JLR where it still makes sense to say the car was designed and made in Britain. Andy Street, mayor of the West Midlands, has lobbied the government to help prevent this Armageddon. Understandably he doesn't want ministers to throw up their hands, much as they did when the steel industry was desperately in need of investment in the 1980s, and leave the market to decide. Street is not alone in believing the region, which accounts for 120,000 of the UK's 600,000 direct jobs in the automotive sector, needs a battery factory as the cornerstone of a re-invented industry. Ralf Speth, the boss of JLR, said the same thing last summer. Currently the major battery makers are in China, Japan and South Korea. The UK boasts a government-funded battery research centre in Coventry. However, the car industry says it needs a factory now, based on existing technology, so firms can make decisions about models that won't appear for another three or four years. Tesla's battery factory cost about $5bn. Understandably ministers feel queasy about spending so much money. They might also feel uneasy when the world's largest car company is taking a different course. Toyota believes batteries and the precious earth metals used to make them will always be bad for the environment. The charging infrastructure will be costly and electric cars will always have severe limits on their range. So it restricts battery use to self-charging units in a hybrid combined with efficient petrol engines. This is a stopgap before making hydrogen cell cars, possibly by 2030. There will be room for pure electric, hybrid and hydrogen cars in 10 years. Can the UK afford the investment to compete in each arena? Most likely we will leave it to others. ",0,Neutral
"Labour must stir up democratic revolution to win power, says Long-Bailey",0.625,Positive,"Labour needs to 'stir up a democratic revolution'and 'pick a fight with the political establishment'in order to win power, Rebecca Long-Bailey, one of the frontrunners, has said. As she was endorsed for the party leadership by Momentum, the leftwing grassroots group, Long-Bailey said it was time to stop mourning Labour's defeat last month and start plotting a path to No 10. Writing for the Guardian, Long-Bailey said the party's Brexit position lay at the heart of its failure to win against Boris Johnson. She said that after the EU referendum in 2016 Labour should have spent less time trying to 'win procedural games in parliament'and more time holding public meetings outside Westminster. 'We should have used the aftermath of the referendum result to go around the country, holding public meeting after public meeting to stir up a democratic revolution, pledging to take on the political establishment and raise up the people's demands beyond our institutional arrangements with the European Union,'she said. Her approach echoes that of Jeremy Corbyn, whose leadership was focused on trying to build a socialist movement to help transform society. Long-Bailey said the next Labour leadership team 'must not junk our values'but ought to change in order to 'trust its members and be so much more than a group of politicians in parliament'ù. By holding public meetings, Labour could have come up with 'a set of popular remedies to deal with the three, linked crises our country faces: of democracy, the economy and the environment'ù, she said. As leader of the party, Long-Bailey said she would seek to create a 'popular movement to turn the British state against the privatisers, big polluters and tax dodgers that have taken hold of our political system'ù. She said scrapping the House of Lords was only the beginning, as the British state 'needs a seismic shock to prise it open at all levels to the people'ù. One poll so far has indicated Long-Bailey is the favourite with the membership, while a previous one put Keir Starmer ahead. Momentum's backing for Long-Bailey is likely to give her a big boost, as the group is planning to host hundreds of phone banks across the country and use peer-to-peer calling apps to support her campaign. More than 70% of 7,395 respondents from the group's 40,000 members gave her their support.A Momentum spokesperson said: 'Our membership has spoken and overwhelmingly backed Rebecca Long-Bailey to be the next leader of the Labour party and the next prime minister of the UK. We will now be mobilising thousands to persuade Labour members in the coming months.'Long-Bailey will also be hoping to pick up the endorsement of at least one big union, such as Unite. Starmer has picked up Unison, the biggest union, while Lisa Nandy won the backing of the National Union of Mineworkers. All five candidates - Emily Thornberry and Jess Phillips round out the list - need three affiliates including two trade unions, or the backing of 33 constituency Labour parties to make it through to the next round of the contest.

Brexit: no union jack-lowering ceremony in European parliament,0,Neutral,"One of the European parliament's union jacks will be sent to the EU museum in Brussels, a committee has decided, but Brexit party MEPs are to be denied a flag-lowering ceremony on 31 January. Instead of the potentially dramatic scene of a union jack being lowered against the midnight sky when Britain leaves the EU on 31 January, parliament grounds staff will remove the flags without ceremony at an unconfirmed time. One flag will then be despatched to the House of History, the EU-funded museum in Brussels that aims to tell the story of the continent, from ancient Greek myths to Brexit referendum promises. Brexit party MEPs had lobbied for a flag-lowering ceremony, a Brussels analogue to the campaign to have Big Ben  'Bong for Brexit'in London. Instead, the European parliament president, David Sassoli, will preside over a low-key ceremony with British MEPs on the evening of 29 January, shortly after the entire parliament votes on the Brexit withdrawal agreement. All 73 British MEPs are invited and the heads of British political party delegations will be invited to say a few words. The MEPs are not expected to get the customary medal, handed out to departing members at the end of each legislature. Senior MEPs decided on this approach at a meeting in Strasbourg that draws a line under the debate over how to mark Brexit day in the European parliament. The occasion 'will be dignified, solemn'ù, said one parliament source. 'It's nothing to be happy about. The idea is just to thank [the MEPs] for their work. The idea is to be serene.'The Brexit party had lobbied for a flag-lowering ceremony that evoked for them the last days of the British empire. 'They don't need to do it as a big formal ceremony, they don't need drums or whatever, but they need to bring the flag down because we are not full members,'one of its MEPs, Nathan Gill, told the Guardian earlier this week. 'It's like that India moment, isn't it, or Hong Kong. You know that's the lasting image.'The MEP for Wales, who plans to be in Brussels rather than attend Nigel Farage's Brexit singalong at Westminster, said lowering the flag would be a symbolic moment. 'That is going to be the actual point that everyone in Britain and Europe accepts the fact that we are gone.'But parliament officials were reluctant to create this scene, a decision rubber-stamped by senior MEPs at a meeting on Thursday without discussion. The European parliament is also shaking up its UK work, as talks shift from the divorce to the future trade relationship. The Brexit steering committee, led by the former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, will be disbanded. A UK coordination group will be set up to keep 705 MEPs in line in negotiations over the most wide-ranging deal the EU will have ever negotiated with a foreign country. One prominent member of the committee will be Nathalie Loiseau, a close ally of Emmanuel Macron, who leads the parliament's sub-committee on security and defence. Joining her will be David McAllister, the German centre-right MEP with Scottish roots, who leads the parliament's foreign affairs committee, as well as Bernd Lange, the German social democrat head of the international trade committee. Earlier this week British MEPs were given the deadlines for clearing their offices, terminating staff contracts and returning equipment, such as EU passes, keys and iPads. Many British MEPs are not entitled to the European parliament's redundancy payment, as they have served for less than a year. 'People were upset,'said one source, who described the meeting as 'bumpy'ù. The departure of British MEPs will see the parliament reduced to 705 MEPs from 751 seats, with 27 British seats redistributed to 14 other countries currently under-represented in Brussels and Strasbourg.

Boris Johnson's Big Ben Brexit bong plan falls flat,0.25,Positive,"An energetic if perhaps niche campaign to ensure the chimes of Big Ben sound at the moment of Brexit on 31 January appears doomed after Commons authorities played down the idea, while a funding plan promised by Boris Johnson to pay for it turned out to not exist. Staunchly pro-Brexit Tories such as Mark Francois and some newspapers have called for lengthy restoration work on the parliamentary clocktower to be paused so the bell can sound at 11pm, marking the moment the UK leaves the EU. A series of donors have pledged to help cover the cost of restoring the currently-dismantled clock mechanism for the night. Speaking to BBC One's Breakfast on Tuesday, Johnson said the government was 'working up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong'ù. But in a statement, the House of Commons Commission, which organises the day-to-day running of parliament, said the bell was 'unlikely'to sound on 31 January, in part due to the estimated cost of £500,000 to make it happen. Work needed would include restoring the clock chime mechanism, testing it, and building a temporary floor in the belfry to allow the work to take place. This would in turn delay the ongoing conservation work by up to four weeks, costing £100,000 alone. Lindsay Hoyle, the new Commons Speaker, who chairs the commission, said the overall cost would mean 'you are talking about £50,000 a bong'ù. He said: 'We also have to bear in mind that the only people who will hear it will be those who live near or are visiting Westminster.'It later emerged that Johnson's 'plan'for a public fund to finance the work does not exist. Asked about the idea, the PM's spokesman said: 'If the public want Big Ben to bong, and the money is raised then that is great. We will make sure that whatever happens in regard to Big Ben's bongs, 31 January is properly marked. It is a significant moment in our history.'Pressed on whether an official plan actually existed, he said: 'There isn't a specific government fund.'",0.125,Positive
Ireland's controversial centenaries are exposing the divides deepened by Brexit,0.125,Positive,"The sense that Irish society would struggle to contain a decade of centenaries marking significant events that occurred between 1912 and 1923 including the suffrage movement, the 1913 Lockout, the Easter Rising of 1916, the Irish war of independence, the Irish civil war and the foundation of the Irish Free State, was appeased somewhat by the successful commemorations that took place throughout 2016. The term 1916 is shorthand for rebellion, resistance, revolution, yet as a nation we have struggled to contextualise impending centenaries as neatly. Historians and others have repeatedly warned that conversations surrounding the war of independence and the civil war in particular will untangle narratives that we have yet to face ourselves. The complexities of commemorating, well, complexities, was exposed last week when the Irish government defended, and then deferred, a commemoration of pre-independence police forces, the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and the Dublin Metropolitan police (DMP). The makeup of the RIC was bolstered by British recruits, particularly the Black and Tans, known for their brutality, and the Auxiliaries, a paramilitary unit made up of former British army officers. To say these entities are much maligned in Ireland would be putting it mildly. All of this is occurring in a shifting environment of Irish nationalism and patriotism, tied to the decade of centenaries itself, a parallel social revolution in women's and LGBTQ+ rights, the invisible but real border dividing the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland becoming central to European politics, and how Brexit has energised the prospect of a united Ireland. This period of centenaries is discussed in broad, tonal terms: it's complicated and dark. Participation in their commemoration comes with appeals for maturity, tolerance, respect and inclusion. But we've talked less about the actual details of that past. In 2016, the reframing of the events of the Easter Rising as the aspirations of an egalitarian society, including a reinvigorated feminist subtext, may have offered something of a false epiphany.  As various politicians spoke out against the RIC/DMP commemoration and some indicated they would boycott such events, the government scrambled to clarify. Its defence was that people were missing a nuanced point. 'The RIC/DMP commemoration is not a celebration,'the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, tweeted before the event was called off. 'It's about remembering our history, not condoning what happened. We will also remember the terrible burning of Cork, Balbriggan, partition and the atrocities of the Civil War. We should respect all traditions on our island and be mature enough as a State to acknowledge all aspects of our past.'Naturally, when you're explaining, you're losing. Varadkar has a tendency to enflame the reaction to controversies of his government's own making by scolding even reasonable detractors. His subsequent assessment of the controversy as a setback for Irish unity appears to place the blame on the controversy that resulted from the mishandling of the event, rather than the mishandling itself. It was obvious that attempting to commemorate entities containing groups that remain despised in Ireland, such as the Black and Tans, was always going to require a degree of nuance and invention that the proposed event in Dublin Castle was never going to provide. One of Varadkar's favourite targets, Sinn FÈin, was also gifted an open goal. 'It is those who resisted British rule in Ireland during the Tan War and citizens that suffered at the hands of the those that maintained British rule who the state should be commemorating,'Sinn FÈin leader Mary Lou McDonald stated, 'not the RIC or the Black and Tans.'Until Brexit, the aspiration of a united Ireland was viewed in the Republic as unrealistic and even romantic. Despite positioning themselves as supporters of such a prospect, the Republic's main parties, Fine Gael and Fianna F√°il, now have to balance their derision of Sinn FÈin with their own enthusiasm for Sinn FÈin's main policy. Previously, the unspoken aspect of deriding Sinn FÈin was that a united Ireland was the ultimate fantasy. Now that the prospect of Irish unity has exited the dream-space, snapped into reality by how Brexit will so irreparably damage Northern Ireland that even unionists might vote to become part of a new, hypothetical all-Ireland entity, Sinn FÈin is primed to expose any cracks in its rivals' republican credentials. These credentials were bolstered by Varadkar and his deputy, Simon Coveney's, green-jersey-wearing throughout the Brexit debacle, but are perhaps a little flimsy when they wander into a situation of accidentally memorialising the Black and Tans. While Sinn FÈin may not immediately manage to translate the ongoing rise in Irish nationalism - particularly among young people - into electoral success, the party is very much on the front foot with regards to renewed aspirations for a united Ireland, sentiment-wise. There are many legacies of the horrors of colonialism in Ireland, but perhaps the most insidious of all is deference. Many Irish people simultaneously hold an anti-authoritarian streak alongside a tendency towards obedience. But there are moments, illustrated by last week's events, where it's clear that particular types of reconciliation need to be collectively agreed upon, and not via instruction or directive from on high. The current period of centenaries was preceded by Queen Elizabeth II's visit to Ireland in 2011, and by an Ireland-England Six Nations rugby match at Croke Park in 2007 when God Save the Queen was played for the first time at the Gaelic Athletic Association grounds, the site of a massacre by members of the RIC and the Auxiliaries in 1920 - another forthcoming centenary. Throughout these events, Irish people displayed what was needed: maturity and respect. But since 2016, we've had four years of dealing with ignorance and disregard towards Ireland, as English nationalism triumphed in the form of Brexit. This changes the atmosphere and makes deferential steps, such as commemorating the RIC, much more difficult to take. It's one thing to negotiate a complex past, another thing entirely to do so during a complex present. '¢ Una Mullally is a columnist for the Irish Times ",0.375,Positive
Festival of Brexit' boss says £120m event will prove cynics wrong,0,Neutral,"It has been mocked and pilloried as a 'festival of Brexit'ù, but the newly appointed boss of the £120m nationwide celebration planned for 2022 has said he is going to embrace the cynics - and prove them wrong. In his first interview as the director of Festival 2022, Martin Green said the aims would be to bring the nation together, showcase British creativity, and on a basic level bring some 'joy, hope and happiness'ù. The idea of a post-Brexit festival of Britain was announced by Theresa May in May 2018 and given the go-ahead by Boris Johnson last year. Green, formerly in charge of the Olympic ceremonies and Hull's year as UK City of Culture, was announced as festival leader over Christmas, and while he is a long way from announcing what might be commissioned, he has a clear idea of its broad aims - and of what it won't be. 'There is obviously a big narrative going on around healing and coming together,'he said. 'There is no doubt that money has been made available because this country is exiting the European Union, there is no getting away from that. 'There is also no doubt that we have been through a particularly divisive time in the discourse of our daily lives, and as we go forward, let's see how the great creativity and ingenuity of the UK can help refind that common ground. 'On a very basic level, we are probably due a bit of joy and hope and happiness, and art is really good at that.'When May announced the idea, it was mocked on social media, and 'festival of Brexit'is not a characterisation Green has much truck with. 'It's a nice line and it makes you look, but I'd argue if you dig down '¶ what on earth would that be about? 'It is absolutely expected that there is a degree of cynicism at the start of every major project '¶ I'm lucky in that I've got form in this.'He said there was cynicism from day one of the Olympic preparations and in Hull. 'What you do is you embrace it. You don't have an attitude to it, because it is a completely natural response. But people come round when they start seeing things for themselves. 'I fully expect the same kind of journey. The responsibility is on me and my team and the people we work with across the UK to deliver something worthy of people's engagement.'Green said he hoped that his track record would dispel fears that it will be a cringe-inducing festival of patriotism. It will also be organised at arm's length from the government. 'We are in charge of the curation of the festival. We will sign off the decisions, working with the devolved nations.'What precise shape the festival will take remains to be seen. May was inspired by the 1951 Festival of Britain, but that was arguably a more graspable idea in that it had a centrepiece location on the South Bank in London. Festival 2022 will not. 'If you're trying to do creative projects which reach and engage as many people as possible, probably what this is never going to be is an event, in a place on a day,'said Green. 'You have to start thinking about other places where creativity exists. Instantly you think digitally, but it's not just that. It's durational things, it's things that travel, it's things of scale, it's about going where people are. 'I've no answers at the moment, but certainly the 'òform' of it is one that brings a smile to my face because it is a challenge. Of course, I'm not the one who is going to answer the question - the great creatives of this country will.'As an illustration, however, Green cites Steve McQueen's Year 3 project with Tate as something that captured the public imagination and reached a huge number of people. He expects to announce a programme by the end of 2021 and anticipates that it will involve 'a small amount of very large acts '¶ There will still be tons going on, but when there is special money on the table, you do want to do things which are not normal business.'The festival will take place in a busy year for Britain. It will be the Queen's platinum (70th) jubilee and the BBC's centenary, and the Edinburgh international festival will be 75. There will also be the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, for which Green is chief creative officer. He predicts that the energy of all the events will feed into each other. If the BBC and the jubilee do look back, it will allow his festival to 'fervently look forward '¶ I don't think it should be a festival of nostalgia.'Green has had discussions with the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, and expects to visit No 10 soon. A big challenge will be winning over scepticism in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. There remains some wariness about the idea of a festival, but Green believes the motivation for it comes from a genuine place, and £120m of Treasury money is not an insignificant amount of money.  'If you are looking to move forward, if you're looking to find common ground, if you're looking to on a really basic level share some joy and hope and community, then the best tool in the box we have is our creativity. Creativity solves problems.'",0,Neutral
"Remainers aren't going to vanish on 31 January. We fight on, sure of our cause",0,Neutral,"In less than three weeks, Britain leaves the EU. Those vast marches, the crowded public meetings, the indefatigable Remain campaigners, the great speeches, the parliamentary wheeler-dealing and principled resignations were all for nothing. The 'get Brexit done'Tories, exploiting the least electable Labour leader ever, won the election and were handed an 80-seat majority. The die is cast. For the political class, the issue has become toxic. Boris Johnson wants Brexit expunged from the lexicon so that the new normal is for Britain to be wholly outside the EU. Labour, flattened by its epic defeat, is agreed that to be pro-EU is political death. Remain Britain - half the population - has no champion. It is a first order political miscalculation. The Conservative party created Brexit. It must own it. Labour, after 2015, made two monumental miscalls: first, not sufficiently opposing austerity and later voting for article 50. There must be no repeat now. Brexit must be opposed in every dimension. This is a Conservative project. The Tories must be its sole sponsor and live with the consequences. I think it will break them. Johnson's first acquaintance with the new reality was in the balmy air of Mustique where he learned Donald Trump had assassinated Iran's General Qassem Suleimani. British service personnel and nationals in the Middle East were suddenly exposed to the risk of deadly reprisals, alongside the risk to British economic and commercial assets. As were those of the French and Germans. There was only one option: organise phone calls with Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel and issue a joint European statement resisting an endorsement of the attack and calling urgently for collective restraint. Little Dominic Raab, granted a fleeting audience with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, was, when he babbled US propaganda, overruled by Johnson. It was the first of many humiliations ahead. Britain is too exposed, too economically and militarily weak and too European in its interests to have a foreign policy consistently independent of the EU. Economically, financially, commercially and culturally, it will be the same story. It's unlikely there will be one single event that crystallises the crisis in our shattered relationship with the continent. Rather, there will be a slow, cumulative drip, drip of bad news and disillusioning personal experiences. By the end of 2020, Brexit will have cost Britain approximately £130bn of lost output, reckons Bloomberg Economics. But from 2021, Conservative refusal to accept the economic reality that Britain can only protect its dense European supply networks by agreeing to continue to implement EU regulations in every sector will mean frozen new investment and escalating closures. Especially in its crucial auto, aerospace, drugs, chemical, food and drink industries. Expect the Japanese carmakers to pull out first, as will Airbus - more will follow. The much touted trade deals with the US, China and India - even if achievable on remotely equitable terms - cannot compensate for lost European markets, especially as the Americans, Chinese and Indians have zero intention of opening up their service sectors to British exporters where we do have some strengths. In this context, growth can only remain depressed and our current account deficit fantastically high. The risk of a run on sterling is ever present, dependent, as Mark Carney, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, memorably said, on the kindness of strangers, whom the government so actively disdains. Given all that, Johnson and Sajid Javid's attempt to launch a 'decade of renewal'ù, in particular by trying to revive failing towns in the Midlands and the north, is once again incontinent babbling. Meanwhile, the dynamic liberal populations of our growing innovative cities will look back on EU membership, with its commitment to openness and bringing a continent together, with fondness and mounting regret. In Northern Ireland and Scotland, there will be determined attempts to do something about it - campaigning bitterly to split from Tory England. The EU, extraordinarily, is about to become very popular. England, too, will move in that direction, but more jerkily. There can be no renewal without reconfiguring our capitalism so that it has a more European stakeholder character, accompanied by active state and city government. Johnson is condemned not to use Brexit to complete the Thatcher revolution as his Tory right want, but paradoxically to Europeanise the British economy to try to bring prosperity to the party's new electoral base beyond the south. He will find that if he is to halt the exodus of inward investment - a crucial prop to the towns he wants to help - he is going to have to find some face-saving way of aligning with EU regulations. Here the EU, if it shows some deftness, can construct a series of custom-made British arrangements. There will have to be standing bilateral councils on defence, cybersecurity, terrorism and climate change where the need is unanswerable on both sides. Similarly, if the UK wants to retain a semblance of its manufacturing industry, alongside trying to grow service industries as disparate as advertising and insurance broking, it will have to follow shared European single-market rules to allow market access. It will be a variable geometry Europe - with the UK as an uneasy outlier. It will also be unstable and unsatisfactory and calls to drop the half-out/half-in relationship will emerge, followed by calls to rejoin fully, not least to keep Britain together. Britain, chastened by its exile and more European in its economic and social model, will find EU membership the second time round much easier. All this is inevitable: the only question is whether it will take five or 15 years, depending on how quickly the Labour party - or a successor - can capture and successfully exploit the new political currents. So at 11pm on 31 January, dismiss Johnson's extravagant claims for what lies ahead and the faux celebrations. Light a candle in a window, at your door, in your garden; find friends to do it together. We stand for a European Britain. We will be back. '¢ Will Hutton is an Observer columnist ",0,Neutral
Brexit deal: EU may threaten 'to block' City's access to its markets,0,Neutral,"The EU will be unashamedly 'political'and block the City of London's access to European markets if Boris Johnson tries to exempt the UK from its laws. Croatia's prime minister, Andrej Plenkoviƒá, whose country is taking over the presidency of the EU, made the bloc's intentions clear after the prime minister insisted the UK would not be aligned to the bloc's regulations. Asked whether the EU would use its power to switch off the City's ability to serve European clients to gain leverage in the coming negotiations with Britain, Plenkoviƒá said: 'I wouldn't go into the vocabulary of weapons but what I have learned in international and European negotiations [is] that all arguments and considerations are treated as political.'A major issue in the EU-UK negotiations over the future relationship concerns the extent to which the British government wants to diverge from the bloc's rules in various sectors of the economy. The outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said this week that it would not be appropriate for the UK to be a 'rule-taker'in the field of financial services after Brexit. The European commission president, however, warned of the economic costs of seeking a loose relationship with the EU. Ursula von der Leyen was also speaking in Zagreb following a meeting with Johnson in Downing Street.  'We have to find a good balance between divergence and being close to the single market,'she said. 'There is a difference in being a member state and not. And there are trade-offs between regulatory divergence on one side and access to the single market. This room now has to be explored in the coming negotiations. In June we will take stock of the progress.'The European commission will make a unilateral decision before the summer on whether it recognises British regulations and supervisory bodies as being sufficiently robust for its financial services sector to continue to work for EU-based clients. The City earns about £205bn a year from European demand for financial services. Trade experts have described the so-called 'equivalence'decision as vital for the UK's financial services sector, which generates 11% of total tax revenues. British banks, traders and insurance firms will lose their automatic 'passporting'rights to work for EU clients at the end of the transition period. After 31 December 2020 they will instead be reliant on the commission providing temporary rights. In an internal briefing for EU diplomats on Friday, commission officials said it would not be business as usual for the City of London after Brexit as a consequence. Diplomats were advised that there was still a significant risk the City would not even be given temporary rights after what officials said would be a granular assessment. One senior EU diplomat said: 'Financial stability requires both sides to quickly agree an equivalence framework. And whilst the preference of the industry to continue on the same basis EU member states will need to be absolutely sure there is a level playing field with appropriate governance. The source said the EU's demands would be unprecedented. 'We have to go well beyond the baseline provided in US cooperation or the more recent Swiss practice,'the diplomat said. The commission has highlighted 40 areas where it may judge the UK's systems to be 'equivalent'but even under such a ruling access can be withdrawn or restricted on a sector by sector basis with just 30 days notice. Previous EU equivalence decisions have also been linked to broader political questions rather than being confined to technical judgments. David Henig, the director of the UK trade policy project at the European Centre for International Political Economy, said: 'Apart from access to UK fishing waters and level playing field conditions typical of trade agreements we have heard little from the EU about their price for preferential UK access or equivalence, which given they are the larger market, could be high. 'Options such as preferential access to UK labour markets and deeper ties to the EU regulatory system are bound to be considered.'",0,Neutral
Boris Johnson's Brexit bill heads for Lords after MPs' vote,0.125,Positive,"Boris Johnson's Brexit bill cleared the House of Commons on Thursday in a major milestone that means the UK is on track to leave the EU on 31 January. The prime minister won a vote on the EU withdrawal bill at third reading by 330 votes to 231, a majority of 99. Before the election, MPs had thwarted Theresa May's Brexit bill and threatened to do the same to Johnson's revised deal. However, the make-up of the new parliament is now strongly pro-Brexit, with Johnson's sizeable Tory majority. The bill will now go to the House of Lords where peers could give it a more challenging hearing but are still unlikely to block its passage. The prime minister's official spokesman warned the House of Lords, where Johnson does not have a majority, not to frustrate the progress of the legislation. 'The country did deliver a very clear message that they want Brexit to be resolved,'he said. The bill passed without amendment in the Commons in marked contrast to torturous previous efforts of May and Johnson to get Brexit legislation through before the election. Opposition MPs tried to force an amendment committing the government to allowing unaccompanied child refugees to continue to be reunited with their families in the UK after Brexit. The previous government had accepted an amendment from Labour peer Lord Dubs seeking continued protections for child refugees after Brexit but Johnson ditched that commitment after the election. A new Conservative MP used his maiden speech to defend the government's decision. David Simmonds claimed vulnerable children were 'very much in the minds of many members'ù, but argued it was 'absolutely right'that these issues should be dealt with in the new immigration bill instead. Speaking of his former role leading the national work across local government on the resettlement of refugees in the UK, Simmonds said: 'What tends to happen is young people are brought to Britain to be linked up with a distant cousin and in fact, they [end up] in the care system of this country.'He added that young refugees in the EU are 'already within countries that have child protection systems that are very similar, equivalent and in some cases better to our own'ù. But Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said Labour can still 'win the moral argument'after its bid to enshrine protections for child refugees in the government's Brexit agreement failed. He urged the government to 'reconsider'its opposition to his party's plans, adding that Labour 'may not win many votes in this parliament, but we can win the moral argument'ù. Downing Street stressed on Thursday that it was ready to begin the next stage of the Brexit process - negotiating a trade deal by the end of the year - on 1 February. But Brussels' chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned the UK's market access to the EU could be limited unless it agreed to conditions on state subsidies. 'If the UK wants an open link with us for the products - zero tariffs, zero quotas - we need to be careful about zero dumping at the same time,'he told a conference in Stockholm. 'I hope that this point is and will be correctly understood by everybody. We will ask necessarily certain conditions on state aid policy in the UK.'He also insisted that Britain's goal to have a full free trade deal by the end of the year was unrealistic. 'We cannot expect to agree on every aspect of this new partnership,'Barnier said, adding 'we are ready to do our best in the 11 months'ù. ",1,Positive
UK accused of 'behaving like cowboys' over EU database copying,0,Neutral,"The British government has been accused of 'behaving like a bunch of cowboys'after a confidential report revealed it had allowed illegal copying of an EU database. The issue, discussed publicly for the first time on Thursday, threatens to sour talks on the post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU, despite hopes on both sides for close ties in fighting crime and terrorism. Sophie in 't Veld, a Dutch liberal MEP, told the European parliament's justice and home affairs committee that a leaked EU report revealed 'deliberate violations and abuse'by the UK of the Schengen Information System, a vast database used by police and border guards across the EU's border-free Schengen zone. While the UK is not a member of the border-free travel area, it has negotiated access to the database, where authorities across Europe share more than 76m items of information on criminal suspects, missing people or contraband goods. 'This is a country that is not a member of Schengen because it doesn't want to be a member of Schengen,'In 't Veld told MEPs. 'It doesn't want to be a member of the European Union. Nevertheless, in the kindness of our hearts we have given them access to the Schengen Information System and they behaved like a bunch of cowboys.'The MEP, who has tabled a complaint to the European commission, said 'one of the most astonishing'features of the leaked report was 'the lack of reciprocity'from British authorities to act in the interest of EU counterparts. 'What the report says is that [British authorities] are basically only interested in people coming into the UK,'she told the Guardian. 'People going out of the UK - if there is an alert, they are not warning the European authorities, so we are not safer.'The leaked EU report states that British border guards only act on alerts 'the UK considers to be important'ù, meaning some checks on people and documents requested by other member states are not carried out. Another charge is that the UK 'does not always take action'if someone wanted for arrest is leaving the UK. British police, according to the report, are trained only to seize contraband goods relating to crimes committed on UK soil, not those in other EU member states. The document, first reported by the EUObserver website in 2018, is based on visits by EU inspectors to 22 sites, including Metropolitan police HQ, Heathrow airport and the Folkestone checkpoint. Nine of the total were surprise visits to police units across the UK, as well as British Transport police. Following those visits in November 2017, the EU concluded that British authorities had made 'unlawful'full or partial copies of the SIS database. The report said 'major deficiencies in the legal, operational and technical implementation of SIS'in the UK that had not been remedied, despite concerns first raised in 2015. The litany of problems pose 'serious and immediate risks to the integrity and security of SIS data'ù. An official responsible for information systems, borders and security at the European commission's Home Directorate, Marc Sulon, told MEPs that an evaluation on how to respond to the report's findings was put 'temporarily on hold in October 2018'because of Brexit negotiations and no-deal planning. EU member states, he said, had decided in June 2018 not to disconnect the UK from the database but give British authorities 'the opportunity to propose a plan for remedial action'ù. The commission's evaluation had resumed as the UK would remain part of the database until at least the end of 2020 under the Brexit transition period. Sulon dismissed claims that the US government had access to the EU database via the UK's illegal copies. US companies working for the UK government are suspected to have made the copies, but Sulon said the rules allowed 'cooperation with contractors '¶ subject to compliance with all provisions of the legislation'ù. MEPs reacted with fury to the commission's handling of the affair, including a missed deadline to respond to a European parliament question raising the alarm. Calling for an inquiry, an Irish independent MEP, Clare Daly, highlighted concerns from the commission that 'other member states have challenges in this area'ù. She said: 'I think the commission needs to come clean about how bad things actually are.'The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, on Wednesday reiterated her call for 'a new comprehensive security partnership'between the EU and the UK 'to fight cross-border threats, ranging from terrorism to cybersecurity to counter-intelligence'ù. But any wide-ranging agreement on data-sharing will almost certainly have to be approved by the European parliament. Asked whether the database issue could be a problem for Brexit negotiations, In 't Veld said: 'I very much hope so,'adding that the report showed 'violation upon violation'ù. She added: 'If [in 2015, the UK] didn't care about the rules then, how are we going to make them respect the rules if they are not in the EU any more?'Neither was she persuaded by the commission's reassurances that the US government did not have access to the data via a British backdoor. 'Yeah and pigs fly '¶ The UK is part of the Five Eyes [intelligence network]. The US lay their hands on anything they can lay their hands on.'A UK government spokesperson said: 'We have some of the highest levels of data protection safeguards globally and are fully committed to meeting our legal obligations. We have a very close security partnership with EU countries, providing information on thousands of alerts every year.'",0,Neutral
Campaigners call for laws to back up farming standards assurances,0,Neutral,"The government will move to reassure the public that Britain's current high standards on animal welfare and farming will be maintained after Brexit with a pledge to ensure future trade deals live up to the values of farmers and consumers. 'Our strong British food brand is built on the high standards to which we hold ourselves,'Theresa Villiers, the environment secretary, will tell the Oxford Farming Conference on Wednesday. 'We can maintain and indeed enhance UK standards as we negotiate new trading relationships with friends and neighbours in the EU and leading global economies.'However, Villiers is expected to stop short of promises on specific standards, such as chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef, and her choice of words - such as 'can'instead of 'will'- leaves room for interpretation. Farmers and campaigners want to see more specific promises enshrined in law. Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers' Union, called for the government to bring in a new food standards commission with the power to scrutinise potential trade deals and ensure they prevent imports of food that would be illegal for farmers to produce in the UK. 'British farmers are world leading in our standards of animal welfare, environmental protection and food safety,'she said. 'Farmers and the public want it to stay that way.'Rob Percival, the head of food and health policy at the Soil Association, said: 'The government's stated commitment to protecting the UK's farming standards post-Brexit is welcome, but needs to be embedded in legislation. If the government is truly committed to ensuring that trade deals live up to the values of farmers and citizens, they should have no objection to providing reassurance by legislating in the agriculture bill to guarantee this.'Trade experts have warned for years that governments such as the US will demand access to UK markets for their food exports, which are often produced to vastly different standards than under EU rules, as the price of any trade deal. For instance, chicken dipped in chlorine is legal in the US but experts say it opens the way to food-borne illness, and standards on antibiotic use in farming are stricter in the EU than in most other countries. The question of whether standards could be sacrificed to seal trade deals is vital not just to many consumers, but to farmers who fear a flood of cheap imports that will undercut their products with lower-quality goods, and the closure of EU markets to UK exports if domestic standards are lowered. Villiers will also pledge to bring forward the long-awaited agriculture bill, the biggest shake-up of British farming in four decades, this month. The legislation was delayed by Brexit, and will change the subsidies given to farmers, which are based mainly on the amount of land farmed, so they are rewarded for protecting the environment, though full details on how this will work have yet to be laid out. There will be a seven-year period of adjustment before the changes are fully implemented. Current farming subsidies, amounting to about £3bn a year, are to be maintained throughout the current parliament, the government has said. Batters also urged ministers to come forward with plans for achieving net-zero carbon for the agriculture sector. 'British farming could achieve net zero by 2040 [10 years sooner than the government's pledge for the whole country],'she said. 'The defining factor to reach our goal and help tackle climate change is a willing government. We are already leading the way in producing climate-friendly food in this country, and this government has a chance to enshrine the UK as a global leader in sustainability.'",0,Neutral
Northern Ireland firms could seek £100m Brexit compensation,-0.25,Negative,"Boris Johnson is facing demands for cash compensation that could run to more than £100m for any disruption caused by Brexit to Northern Ireland's businesses. Leading entrepreneurs who met political leaders in a local summit on Friday, fear the trade barrier down the Irish Sea will mean higher costs for consumers and businesses. 'People here did not vote for this future, we should not be expected to pay the price for it in jobs and lost opportunities,'said Colum Eastwood, the newly elected MP for Foyle and leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party. Business leaders representing 12 sectors in the region have received cross-party support from the Democratic Unionist party, Sinn FÈin and two newly elected Northern Irish parties for four amendments to Brexit legislation. They will be debated this Wednesday. Senior government sources have warned of the 'high hurdles'that the group faces to get its amendments through but the business groups say they will continue the fight in London, Dublin and Brussels to mitigate the profound impact Brexit will have locally. 'In the best-case scenario, these amendments go through, and we have protected Northern Irish businesses and consumers. 'In the worst-case scenario, we have raised and waved a very large flag in Dublin, London and Brussels that Northern Ireland 'òsorted' is simply not true,'said Aodh√°n Connolly, director of Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, one of the 12 groups behind the amendments. They are seeking legal guarantees for 'unfettered'trade across the Irish Sea and future consultation with the devolved government over any new Brexit regulation affecting Northern Ireland. Their fourth amendment, which was not published over the weekend, calls for compensation. It states 'no additional official or administrative costs consequent on any such regulations may be recouped from the private sector'ù. While no figure has been put on the cost, Connolly said the scale of it was clear. 'Around the room on Friday it was very clear that for each of the industries the additional costs could run to tens of millions each,'he said, spelling out a potential cost of more than £100m across the board. The groups behind the amendments include the Ulster Farmers Union, the Confederation of British Industry, Manufacturing Northern Ireland, the Dairy Council and the Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association. The government is unlikely to be defeated but Johnson could face political pressure as he promised unfettered trade during the election campaign. Johnson has promised that Northern Ireland businesses will face 'no barriers of any kind'ù, even telling exporters during the election campaign that if they were asked to fill in any paperwork, they should telephone him directly and he would tell them to throw it in the bin. His remarks were challenged by the EU and by Ireland's deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, who said it was 'very clear'when the deal was done that there would have to be checks on goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This is because under Johnson's revised withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland will continue to follow the EU customs code, which includes customs declarations and other formalities. Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, also accused Johnson of breaking a personal promise he had made to the party. Connolly said the business groups were trying to work with the government and not 'bash'them over Brexit. It was 'common sense'that a lorry carrying 1,000 different goods would face disruption, with as many as '800'of the goods facing sanitary and phyto-sanitary checks coming into Northern Ireland.

Brexit: Johnson to open trade talks with Ursula von der Leyen,-0.5,Negative,"Boris Johnson is expected to open talks on the country's post-Brexit trade deal with the new president of the European commission when she visits Downing Street next week. The prime minister will meet Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday for the first time since she took up her post, three weeks before Britain's departure from the EU on 31 January. Von der Leyen suggested last month that  Johnson should reconsider his refusal to extend the 11-month timeframe available for agreeing a deal on the UK's future relationship with the EU after Brexit. During the post-Brexit transition, Britain will remain in the bloc's customs union and single market, meaning it continues to trade under EU rules, until the end of 2020. Johnson has ruled out the option of maintaining those arrangements for a further two years. He claims there is enough time to negotiate a deal with the EU covering issues including trade, internal security, transport and data sharing. Comprehensive trade deals between the EU and countries such as Canada, Japan and Singapore have previously taken between six and eight years to agree. Britain's withdrawal agreement allows for a prolongation of the transition period to be negotiated by 1 July. If no trade deal is in place by the end of 2020 and there is no extension, the UK faces major disruption to its economy with tariffs and quantity restrictions immediately applied to goods sold into the single market. Von der Leyen, a former German defence minister, said last month in an interview with French newspaper Les Echos: 'It's not only about negotiating a free trade deal but many other subjects. It seems to me that on both sides we must ask ourselves seriously if all these negotiations are feasible in such a short time. 'I believe that it would be reasonable to review things in the middle of the year, if necessary to see if an extension is needed.'Von der Leyen took up her post last month as president of the European commission, the EU body responsible for drafting and enforcing laws for member bodies, succeeding Jean-Claude Juncker. As well as meeting Johnson next week, she will also give a speech at the London School of Economics during her visit. ",-0.25,Negative
Michael Howard's way out of line on the judiciary,0.25,Positive,"Michael Howard claimed on the Today programme that the judges of the supreme court distorted the law and exceeded their powers when they decided that the prime minister's attempt to prorogue parliament in September was unlawful (Report, 28 December). Howard's claim is untenable. The decision was made unanimously by all 11 judges. It was expressed in a carefully reasoned judgment citing authorities going back to the 17th century. It has been powerfully supported by other eminent lawyers including Lord Sumption, recently retired from the supreme court but himself a sharp critic of judicial encroachment on the political sphere. Since Howard made his claim he has been robustly rebutted by Lady Hale, retiring president of the court. Lord Howard is of course entitled to his opinion, but alarm bells are ringing. He is a very senior Tory politician and he echoes the prime minister's own criticism of the prorogation ruling. The rightwing thinktank Policy Exchange has also just now published a polemic against the judiciary with a foreword by Lord Howard. The Queen's speech confirmed the promise in the Conservative election manifesto that a 'Constitution, Democracy and Rights Commission'would be established by the new government in its first year to 'come up with proposals to restore trust in our institutions and in how our democracy operates'ù. Could this be a threat to silence uncooperative judges? Our independent judiciary is a key safeguard of our democracy. We cannot let an authoritarian government undermine it.Geoffrey BindmanLondon '¢ The supreme court did not thwart the will of parliament nor, as Michael Howard alleges, did it distort the law. Instead it upheld the rights of parliament, firstly in rejecting the attempt by Theresa May to trigger article 50 without the authority of parliament and secondly in thwarting the prorogation of parliament by Boris Johnson without the authority of parliament. And it is significant that the latter decision was made unanimously by 11 justices of the supreme court who among them must hold a wide variety of personal political opinions. They understood the history and nature of parliamentary democracy and the balance between the royal prerogative and the houses of parliament rather better than those current politicians who threaten to change it to suit their convenience.David WardCaldbeck, Cumbria  '¢ Join the debate - email guardian.letters@theguardian.com '¢ Read more Guardian letters - click here to visit gu.com/letters '¢ Do you have a photo you'd like to share with Guardian readers?

Anti- and pro-Brexit campaign heads join open letter calling for end to division,-0.375,Negative,"The former directors of both the leave and remain campaigns in the EU referendum have joined cultural and religious leaders across the UK in an open letter calling for a 'decade of reconnection'ù. The letter, released on New Year's Day, describes the 2010s as 'the decade of division'ù, and says the country is 'polarised'and 'more fragmented than any of us would like'ù. The heads of the British Olympic and Paralympic Associations, Scouts and Guides are among those calling for greater social integration and cohesion, and are encouraging Britons to make a new Year's resolution to engage meaningfully with those around them. 'Our resolution is to reconnect,'the letter says. 'To reach out to just one person we don't know, or from whom we have drifted apart. To start rebuilding connections between neighbours and fellow citizens.'Sikh, Islamic, Jewish and Christian leaders joined the former heads of Britain Stronger in Europe and Vote Leave to call for an end to social divisions. Tim Roache, the general secretary of the GMB union and Emily Eavis, the co-organiser of the Glastonbury festival, and Kwame Kwei-Armah, the artistic director of the Young Vic; have also signed the letter, alongside the chair of the Jo Cox Foundation, Jacqui Smith. Imam Qari Asim, the chair of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, said a lack of integration had led to social tension. 'What worries me, in these polarised times, is that our growing distance from each other can breed fear of those who we don't know or are seen as different,'he said. 'At my mosque in Leeds I see many efforts to connect with others, but I see the gaps too - people who don't have much contact with those from a different background to their own.''The start of a new decade offers us a moment of change and of hope - that we can all reach out and find a connection with someone new,'Asim added. His message was echoed by Right Rev Nick Baines, the bishop of Leeds, who said that the turn of the decade offered an opportunity 'to be an agent of healing in a fractured society'ù. 'Yes, this is a big challenge, but we all know someone to whom we can reach out afresh. Whoever we are, we can all do our bit to rebuild for the common good,'he said. The letter comes after several months of collaboration across the organisations, who wanted to 'put down a marker and start a conversation'ù, according to Steve Ballinger from British Future, a thinktank focusing on issues of identity, integration, and migration. 'It's important to have a diverse range of voices within the letter, because if you want to improve social connection, you have to have a broad coalition and make it something for everyone,'he said. Ballinger said the message was addressed to every level of society, from individuals to institutions, right up to Downing Street.  'At an individual level, we're hoping people will reach out to those they've lost touch with, or never had contact with,'he said. 'Perhaps it could be joining in with community projects, or it might simply be a smile and nod to someone in the morning. Just taking our headphones off and looking up from our phones.'",-0.125,Negative
EU accused of seeking to cut funds for poor in post-Brexit cost savings,0,Neutral,"The European commission has been accused of seeking to cut EU funding for the continent's poorest people by 50% to secure post-Brexit cost savings and extra funds for defence projects. Jacques Vandenschrik, the president of the European Food Banks Federation, said the EU executive's proposed spending plans for the next seven years posed a risk not only to the most vulnerable but to the stability of wider society. EU institutions are currently hammering out the details of the bloc's long-term budget, known as the multiannual financial framework (MFF). The UK's withdrawal will leave a large hole to plug. Senior EU officials have described the negotiations over the commission's proposed £1,135bn (£970bn) in spending commitments as the most difficult ever undertaken. The current budget ending in 2020 contained a £3.8bn fund for European aid to the most deprived (FEAD) to help EU member states provide people with food and basic supplies such as clothing, shoes, soap and shampoo. Under the proposed 2021-27 budget there would be no such dedicated fund but member states would be asked to devote a minimum of £2bn in total to food and basic material assistance. The commission has said it hopes member states will allocate twice that minimum amount - but there would not be any obligation. Vandenschrik, whose organisation helps food banks across Europe to distribute surplus produce to where it is most needed with the assistance of cash from FEAD, said the commission's proposal was a 'false economy'ù. He said: 'I think we must do better for the poorest of the poor. We cannot accept that we must deliver half or 60% of the food that they receive now. The explanation is that the overall budget of Europe needs to be tightened up. Brexit is one of the arguments. The other is the need for the strengthening of the defence of Europe. But this will have an impact on health and social cohesion. It is a false economy to save on the poor. 'It is far better to increase their purchase power by giving them food so that the little money they don't spend on food they can spend on the economy.'The commission wants to spend £13bn on a European defence fund to coordinate research and investment after calls from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for greater EU military independence from the US. The UK paid about £15.5bn into the EU budget in 2018. Food banks represented by Vandenschrik's umbrella organisation fed 9.5 million people in 2018 and distributed 781,00 tonnes of food, equating to 4.3m meals a day. Vandenschrik said the poorest people in eastern European member states would probably be hit hardest by the commission's proposals. About 33.1 million people or 6.6% of the EU population are estimated to be living in severe material deprivation. Vandenschrik said: 'The consequences will be an increase in instability and incivility. If people and their children are hungry, they will make plans. And this might not be very nice for society. We cannot make progress by leaving the poor on the side. This is not the way to make our society better.'A commission spokeswoman said it would be 'vigilant'in encouraging member states to hit the target of spending £4bn on the most deprived. She said: 'Following an impact assessment, the commission proposed to merge the fund for European aid to the most deprived into the new European social fund plus for the EU's budget of 2021-2027 to ensure better synergies between the two funds. 'The commission has proposed an EU-level target of 4% of the European social fund plus's budget of £100bn in shared management to address material deprivation, which would mean the amount is similar to the current FEAD budget [of £3.8bn]. The commission is confident that this target amount of funding will be programmed by member states and the commission will be vigilant in ensuring this.'The spokeswoman added: 'Member states experience different degrees of poverty and social exclusion, and several member states are expected to maintain more than 5% of funds available for the support to the most deprived. However, as a safeguard, we have proposed a 2% minimum allocation.'",0,Neutral
UK economy faces weakest growth outside recession since second world war,-0.375,Negative,"The British economy is on track for the weakest year outside a recession since the second world war, as political turmoil and Brexit uncertainty dragged down growth, a Guardian analysis reveals. At the end of a turbulent year and following Boris Johnson's election victory, surveys of business activity suggest economic growth in the final three months of 2019 has essentially stalled. The jobs market is showing signs of stress and public borrowing is steadily rising again after a decade of improvement. The Bank of England has downgraded its forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by only 0.1% in the fourth quarter as high street spending stalled and business investment was kept on hold before the election and amid Brexit uncertainty. Economic growth for 2019 as a whole is forecast to be just 1%, the weakest expansion outside a recession for more than half a century. It comes as Andrew Bailey prepares to replace Mark Carney as the Bank's next governor in March, tasked with steering the economy after Britain withdraws from the EU and while it attempts to strike new trade deals with other world partners. The Conservatives promised a 'tidal wave'of business investment would return to Britain if they secured a majority and unblocked parliament to take the UK out of the EU at the end of January. However, two former Bank interest rate-setters warned the UK economy would continue to struggle for growth as Johnson faces complex trade talks with Brussels next year. The also warned the prime minister's decision to leave the option of no-deal Brexit on the table will hold back business investment. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC), said: 'A new government and a new Bank of England governor. This should be a fresh start for the UK economy. But the dark shadow of Brexit continues to overhang our economic performance and prospects.'High street closures in 2019 Thousands of high street jobs have been lost in the last 12 months as a result of high profile retail administrations, and thousands more are at risk as Mothercare, Debenhams and Forever 21 prepare for closures.

City economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before the data was released and in four cases the outcome was worse than expected, while in three cases it was better. The pound has rallied strongly and stock markets have surged in recent weeks amid hopes that Johnson's new government, with an 80-seat majority, can make progress towards smoothly extracting Britain from the EU. There are also hopes for stronger economic growth spurred by a splurge in government spending. The FTSE 100 has raced ahead since the election on the back of the unexpectedly large Tory majority and amid signs of a breakthrough in the US-China trade war - a dispute that has dragged down global trade volumes and harmed economic growth around the world this year. However, the UK economy appears to have suffered in the run-up to the election. Employment growth relied on public sector job creation, as business across the private sector shed workers and wage growth slowed. The Resolution Foundation warned that weak growth in 2020 would be consistent with falling employment levels. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the thinktank, said: '2019 was a bad year for the economy, which looks set to have recorded its weakest GDP growth outside of recessions since the war.'According to surveys of business activity compiled by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, the snap winter election depressed companies' activity levels in November. Suggesting the economy stalled in the fourth quarter, Britain's dominant services sector - which accounts for about 80% of the economy - failed to grow for the third month in a row. Manufacturing and construction activity also dropped. Economists said Johnson's election victory could provide companies with greater clarity required to boost activity levels, supporting stronger economic growth, but warned that lingering uncertainty over a trade deal with the EU would continue to hold back growth in 2020. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank's MPC, said: 'Foreign firms and even some British firms will find it more attractive for many years to take whatever investment money they have to Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark or Sweden - which all look like safer havens than the UK.''Firms continue to stockpile as insurance against possible disruption from a disorderly Brexit. None of this is good for UK growth.'",-1,Negative

Writing in the Guardian, Timmermans, a former Dutch foreign minister who was also deputy to Jean-Claude Juncker, says he first grew to love the UK and the character of its people through his time at a British school in Rome, Saint George's English School. The British doubts over the European project had offered a healthy check on the more federalist ambitions of figures through the decades, he suggests in his article. He writes: 'I know you now. And I love you. For who you are and what you gave me. I'm like an old lover. 'I know your strengths and your weaknesses. I know you can be generous but also miserly. I know you believe yourself to be unique and different. And of course you are in many ways, but perhaps less than you think.''You will never stop referring to the rest of us as 'òthe continent','Timmermans adds of the British attitude through the decades to EU membership. 'It helps you to create a distance you think you need. But it also prevents you from seeing that in fact we all need a bit of distance between us. All European nations are unique. Our differences are a source of admiration, surprise, discomfort, misunderstanding, ridicule, caricature and, yes, love.'Negotiations on the future relationship will start in earnest in March once the UK has formally withdrawn and negotiating positions on both sides of the channel have been confirmed. Boris Johnson has said he will not extend the transition period, during which the UK will remain in the customs union and single market but not the EU's decision-making institutions, beyond December 2020. Clashes are expected over access to British waters for European fishing fleets and, more significantly, the EU demand that the British government sign up to its environmental, social and fiscal rules in return for tariff-free trade in goods. Timmermans talks of his grief at the unpicking of the relationship built since the UK's accession to the European economic community in 1973. He suggests that David Cameron's decision to hold the 2016 referendum was unnecessary. He writes: 'You were in two minds about it, like you have always been in two minds about the EU. I wish you had stuck to that attitude - it served you well and it kept all of us in better shape. 'Was it necessary to force the issue? Not at all. But you did. And the sad thing is: I see it is hurting you. Because the two minds will still be there, even after you have left. In the process, so much unnecessary damage has been done to you and all of us. And I fear more will follow.'Timmermans concludes, however, that the UK 'will always be welcome to come back'ù. ",0.25,Positive
London expected to co-host next stage of post-Brexit negotiations,0,Neutral,"London is expected to co-host the next stage of post-Brexit negotiations with Brussels in a symbolic shift marking the UK's position outside the EU after 31 January. The most likely location for the talks involving teams led by Michel Barnier for the EU and a yet-to-be-identified minister for the British government is the Cabinet Office in Whitehall. Brussels took centre stage over the past three years as the UK remained an EU member state. The EU's control over press conferences at the European commission's Berlaymont headquarters irritated the former Brexit secretary David Davis, who avoided visiting due to Barnier's tendency to monopolise media coverage. With the UK negotiating as a 'third country'ù, the rules are due to change. For 11 months after withdrawal on 31 January, the UK will stay in the EU's single market and customs union. But it will no longer be a member state and officials in Brussels expect the location of the talks to be split. The shift is expected to be confirmed in 'talks about talks'due between the UK and EU negotiators in February, sources said.  A government spokesman said: 'The political declaration makes clear that the UK and EU have to jointly agree the scheduling of talks. More details will be set out in due course.'Negotiations on the future relationship are expected to start in earnest in early March. EU member states are due to adopt their negotiating position on issues such as trade in goods, fisheries, security and level playing field demands on 25 February after the publication of a draft paper in the first week of the month. A leaked diplomatic note seen by the Guardian said: 'The mandate will contain no surprises and will be based on the political declaration. 'Topics such as fisheries or a level playing field will be discussed [internally] in January. These discussions will be based on slide presentations from the European commission instead of official drafts. That should give a sense of the sensitivities of member countries and make progress easier.'There is no expectation that the 11-month transition period will be extended beyond the end of 2020. An EU official said: 'The member states have been told it is not happening.'But the June summit of EU leaders - without UK involvement - is expected to be a pivotal point in the negotiations and will signal whether hope remains of securing at least a 'bare bones'deal on trade, fishing rights and security by the end of the year. On trade in goods, the EU's negotiating position is yet to be finalised, with seminars for diplomats organised from 8 January up to the end of the month. But the level playing field demands in the 2018 Irish protocol, which would have tied the UK to the EU's customs union, are seen as a baseline below which Brussels will not go. Theresa May had committed the UK to dynamically aligning with future EU changes to competition and state aid rules in the 'Irish backstop'ù. The commitment on environmental protections and social and labour standards was to not lower them. Sources suggested the French government might seek to toughen the demands further during internal EU discussions in February. 'The French said at the time that they negotiated the Irish backstop and its provisions in the name of peace, and that this would be different,'said one EU source. 'The aim in February will be to have everyone owning the strategy.'An EU source said: 'The issue is not whether the UK will seek to undercut the EU but whether they could, and therefore it holds us back in our own policymaking. That's the problem.'Suggestions from Whitehall that the UK would accept tariffs on some goods as the price for diverging from EU standards have concerned officials in Brussels. 'If we start talking about tariffs, there is no chance of a trade deal by the end of the year, as it becomes a very complicated discussion among the member states,'one source said. A major strand of the talks is expected to be related to security issues. 'How do we extradite someone, for example?'asked one EU source. 'It won't be the European arrest warrant, but we need something between that and nothing. It has to be there - it would be unforgivable if it was not. 'There also needs to be agreement on sanctions. You can just coordinate, with the UK tagging on to EU decisions, but that makes sanctions less likely to be supported in the courts. You need a formal agreement.'On fisheries, the political declaration obliges the EU and the UK to make 'best endeavours'to agree on future access to British waters by 1 July, but Brussels sources are sceptical as to whether such a deal can be struck in that time. 'Without an agreement on fish, there will not be a deal - the price for a trade deal is the level playing field demands and fishing rights,'said an EU source. 'But in reality, we don't have to agree it by the summer, just the end of the year.'Gerard van Balsfoort, the chair of the European Fisheries Alliance, a lobby group representing the fishing fleets of the member states most affected by Brexit, said there needed to be certainty each year on the allocation. 'Of course, if the UK is outside the EU, it will have their own fisheries policy and they will be an independent coastal state, and everything will not remain the same,'he said. 'But the real issue with fisheries is where can you fish, and how much. And with these two things, it is easy: we have the quota sharing set in stone. And we want an agreement that reflects what we have now. 'You can ask whether that is realistic, but the UK points to Norway. With Norway, the quotas are set in stone. There is an allocation key from the early 1980s. And that hasn't changed.'An EU source said: 'In reality, if we can't agree on fish then we really are in trouble.'",0,Neutral
"Even in Tory heartlands, Boris Johnson was merely the lesser of two evils
",0.125,Positive,"A six-week election campaign in which I have been wholly absorbed in the politics of my constituency while standing as an independent candidate is not necessarily a good place to gain a perspective on the state of the nation and the prospects for Boris Johnson's new government. But my experience in Beaconsfield did provide me with a picture of the public mood in part of the Thames Valley, which appears relevant to those wider issues. Beaconsfield is Conservative heartland. The county council has been Conservative since its creation in the 19th century. Apart from the period 1906-10 when it went Liberal and 1945-50 when part of it was linked to Slough and was Labour, it has had a succession of Tory MPs. I was elected in 1997 with a 14,000 majority and it had risen to 25,000 by 2017. The Conservatism runs deep. The area has great wealth and some of the most expensive housing in the country. But it has always been noteworthy that Conservative voters can be found in numbers in every social group. Indeed, the even split in the vote at the 2016 referendum reflects that this is not just the home of out-of-town members of the liberal metropolitan elite. There is an extensive presence of skilled workers providing services, and a substantial community of British Asians who have moved in a generation from poor immigrants to very successful businesspeople and professionals. There are also pockets of deprivation, accentuated by low levels of public funding for key services. The response to the election and to my standing as an independent against my own party, as a critic of its Brexit policy, was revealing. I received support across the political spectrum: from Liberal Democrats, pro-remain Conservatives and some Labour voters. I also found support from many people who had previously had no affiliation or tendency to back any political party. They turned out in dozens - as volunteers - to campaign because they saw Brexit as a disaster and feared for the country's future. But I could also see throughout the loyalty and tribalism felt for the Conservative party I was challenging. Central to this was fear of Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party he had shaped. He was truly the bogeyman of this election, his policies and attitudes deeply disliked and ridiculed by the overwhelming majority, irrespective of social status. The risk of his winning was played on relentlessly by the Conservatives as a reason for electors not to vote for me, even if they shared my views on Brexit. It was undoubtedly successful as a tactic on the doorstep. In contrast, Johnson's promise to 'get Brexit done'carried much less traction. Apart from ardent Brexiteers, few voters I spoke to had confidence in its outcome and fewer still saw Johnson as a trustworthy leader. Indeed, I have never experienced an election where opinion on a prime minister was so cynical and dismissive. He was just the lesser of two evils. But there was also little sense among constituents, despite my best efforts, that there was any alternative to seeing Brexit through. Some were resigned to leaving the European Union even though they believed this would be harmful for Britain. Others were just angry that it had not already happened, although it was noticeable that few would give an example of any advantage to be gained from leaving the EU. Leaving has become an end in itself. Anger over the failure to deliver Brexit was frequently linked to anger on other matters, often local issues on planning or education. A sense of being ignored among the financially less advantaged is not confined to the Midlands and the north, even in an area of near-zero unemployment. Johnson's new government starts with two great advantages: expectations of it are low and he has a working majority. But the desire for a future of greater empowerment, of 'taking back control'ù, is strong and it is hard to see how this will square with a disruptive Brexit that adversely affects living standards or diminishes UK influence in the world. The risk of a prolonged crisis over Scotland and the future of the union in general is another factor. Some of my Brexiteer interlocutors in this campaign affected to dismiss this impact, but that seemed to me to be displacement activity. As so much of the current crisis is built around issues of identity, I doubt that the reality of a lengthy constitutional crisis that threatens to break up the country will be viewed with such equanimity if it happens. In victory Johnson has talked about healing the rift that Brexit has caused in our country. He is right to do so, because history shows that the success of democracy is as much about creating a climate where minorities can accept majority decisions as it is the imposition of the 'will of the people'ù. But to achieve this depends on language and tone as well as showing respect for those with whom one disagrees. The problem is that even in his first four months in office Johnson has unleashed a tide of invective and mendacity, enough to make one question how this evil genie will ever be returned to its bottle. It is the classic problem of revolutions where the ends are always used to justify improper means. Those volunteers who came in such numbers to support me were as horrified by this as by Brexit itself and it will take a great deal to win back their trust.

"Boris Johnson should 'stop campaigning and start governing', says Ken Clarke",0,Neutral,"Ken Clarke has warned Boris Johnson he must 'stop campaigning and get on with governing'ù, condemning the prime minister for seemingly having no detailed plans for a final Brexit deal, or for other vital issues such as social care. The veteran former Conservative MP, who stepped down from parliament at the election having been stripped of the Tory whip shortly beforehand, said Johnson should replace advisers such as Dominic Cummings with people who were able to govern. Clarke said that while Johnson's 80-strong majority meant he was able to run the country more or less as he chose, Clarke told BBC Radio 5 he had seen few signs yet of any coherent policy programme. 'Governing the country is more than going around saying, 'òOooh, 2020 is going to be a golden year, and we're going to be global Britain,''he said. 'At the moment we've got a stagnant, fragile economy, an angry, discontented population. It's a very dangerous world out there in many, many ways.'Clarke said Johnson's policy vagueness was particularly acute on Brexit: 'I could never get out of Boris - and nobody so far could get out of Boris - what he has in mind for the eventual deal. To say they're generalities is an understatement. 'It's not good sitting alongside the people who've been mandated by 27 other governments and just saying your aim is to be global Britain. They'll say, 'òWhat are we going to do about nuclear safeguarding in Euratom?''Johnson had no policy on social care, the most pressing domestic issue, or on skills training and education, Clarke said. One issue, he argued, was that Johnson was still surrounded by all the people who ran the campaign, such as Cummings. He said: 'I don't get the impression that they've yet pressed the government button. They've now got five years, and certainly for the first two or three they can do whatever they want. Do they know what they want? Are they prepared for that?'Clarke added: 'He'd better get on with it and shunt aside all these people who won the campaign for him, quite brilliantly, and get in some policy wonks, strengthen his cabinet, have some ministers who can take through some things that will make a real difference.'Clarke compared the situation with the aftermath of Margaret Thatcher's election win in 1987, when he first joined the cabinet. 'She knew exactly what she was going to do,'he said. 'We had detailed intentions to go for major structural reforms. And we got going straight away.'After stepping down as MP for Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire following almost 50 years in parliament, which he had decided to do before losing the Tory whip for rebelling over Brexit, Clarke said he was still fascinated by politics: 'I now find I'm watching the parliament channel.'Asked if he expected a peerage, Clarke said: 'I'm not personally expecting to get the telephone call, but there we are. I think Mr Cummings has been assuring the newspapers that a whole lot of Brexiteers are going to be put in the House of Lords to give them some more voices there. So if Mr Cummings is making the appointments, I don't think he'll regard me as eligible for that.'",0,Neutral
Home Office 'òignoring offers to give homes to child refugees',0,Neutral,"The Home Office has been accused of ignoring more than 1,400 offers from local councils to house child refugees, prompting criticism that Boris Johnson's government is defying its obligations to offer sanctuary to vulnerable minors. Councils across the UK have volunteered to take hundreds of unaccompanied children from across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. However, numbers of arrivals are said to be 'pitifully low to nonexistent'ù. Wiltshire, Leicestershire, Brighton and Hove, along with the London boroughs of Islington, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Lewisham have each pledged to take at least 100 children, according to charity Safe Passage. Birmingham has offered to support 80 more minors, Bristol 60 and Leicester 50. More than 400 of the offers come from Conservative-run local authorities, 950 from Labour councils and the remainder from SNP and independents. It is estimated that about 200 child refugees are living in terrible conditions in northern France, with thousands more trapped in Italy and Greece, where camps are vastly overcrowded and conditions are described as dire. Many are eligible for transfer to the UK. The claims of Home Office resistance to the councils' offers comes after Johnson told parliament on Thursday he was reducing legal protections for refugee children in his new Brexit bill. The legislation, passed last week with a majority of 124, jettisons a commitment in EU regulations that secures safeguards for asylum-seeking minors in Europe who want to reunite with family in the UK. The commitment was in the original withdrawal agreement bill after a campaign led by Labour peer Lord Dubs, who fled the Nazis via Kindertransport when he was six. Last night Dubs said: 'It's miserable. Safe Passage have found quite a few local authorities that are willing to take children. We're talking about a basic principle here. It's extremely mean and lacking in humanitarian instincts for the government to keep pulling back on this.'The Home Office on Saturday night disputed the figure of 1,400 council placements waiting to be filled. Hours earlier, charities in northern France said they had found a 15-year-old Afghan boy called Mustapha who is sleeping rough near Calais and trying to reach England to be reunited with his brother. Campaigners said the prime minister's bill threatened the teenager's hopes of reaching the UK via a safe legal route. 'These kids are in a desperate situation and they've got no way out,'said Dubs. Labour leadership hopeful Lisa Nandy said Johnson's Brexit bill was a taste of things to come. 'This is a very clear signal of what sort of government Boris Johnson intends to run. It's a direct attack on some of the most vulnerable children in the world and it shows that any hint of compassionate conservatism will play no part in his premiership. This approach will extend to welfare, disability and we'll see the most rightwing government in my lifetime.'Beth Gardiner-Smith, chief executive of Safe Passage, said the Brexit bill 'placed vulnerable child refugees on the negotiating table'and meant more lone children would be forced to take huge risks trying to get into the UK. 'This action is all the more inexplicable because we know there is broad public support for helping child refugees,'she said. Gardiner-Smith added: 'Instead of scrapping what few protections there are in place, the government should be focusing its energies on working with councils to ensure there is adequate funding to fill those 1,400 places and offer hope to hundreds of children stranded across Europe.'The pledges have been made by councils under the Home Office's Vulnerable Children's Resettlement Scheme (VCRS) on the proviso that full funding is in place, with a common complaint being that the central government money available is insufficient. The only available data indicates that just 20 unaccompanied minors have been allowed into the UK under a scheme begun more than three years ago to resettle 3,000 vulnerable refugee children from conflict zones in the Middle East and north Africa. Separate figures also reveal a sluggish take-up under the Dubs amendment, launched in April 2016 and geared to allowing unaccompanied child refugees from Europe into the UK. MPs and campaigners hoped the Dubs scheme would resettle around 3,000 children but ministers controversially set a limit of 480 with the Home Office yesterday not specifying how many have since been transferred. 'It was limited because they said councils hadn't find more places but since then Safe Passage has discovered there are quite a few local authorities who've come up with more places. The government is trying to shut down the scheme on spurious grounds,'said Dubs. Charities said they had detected a hardening of the Home Office approach to child refugees even before the bill was unveiled. Clare Moseley, founder of Care4Calais, said: 'It's become absolutely horrible, I do not understand how it can be this hostile, how our country can behave like this, how they keep saying no to this.'Campaigners say the issue partly explains why the numbers of vulnerable minors brought to the UK are so low despite so many council places being available. A Home Office spokesperson said: 'We have a proud record of helping vulnerable children, granting protection to 41,000 since 2010 and doing more than the vast majority of EU countries to help unaccompanied minors. 'Protecting vulnerable children will remain our priority after Brexit and this new clause reaffirms our commitment while clarifying the role of parliament and government in negotiations.'",0,Neutral
Johnson revises EU bill to limit parliament's role in Brexit talks,-0.25,Negative,"Boris Johnson's EU withdrawal agreement bill has been published, with protections on workers' rights, unaccompanied refugee children and parliament's say over the future relationship stripped out. MPs are expecting to vote on the EU withdrawal agreement bill for the first time in this parliament on Friday, as Johnson aims to rush it through its first stage before Christmas. The new bill scraps or waters down a number of key protections that were in the last one published in October, when Johnson was trying to get the support of some backbench Labour MPs to get it through parliament. It removes an entire schedule that promised to protect workers' rights, with the government suggesting this will now be dealt with in separate legislation. Ministers will no longer be bound by the legislation to provide updates on the future trading relationship or to make sure parliament approves the government's negotiating objectives. In a third change, a commitment to take unaccompanied refugee children from Europe, known as the Dubs amendment, is watered down. The legislation acknowledges this is still an aim but does not make a legal promise to take them. A No 10 spokesman said: 'We are committed to ensuring that children who are claiming asylum or international protection will be reunited with specified family members in the EU and vice versa. 'The government's policy on child refugees has not changed and we will continue to do all we can to enable children to claim asylum and be reunited with their families, which the legislation published today reaffirms.'Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said the changes showed the Tories now want to 'tear up those protections'for refugee children. In terms of additions, the bill introduces a clause to rule out an extension to the transitional period, and powers to let lower courts overrule judgments from the European court of justice. The bill overall hands much greater power to Johnson's government to shape a harder Brexit without the checks and balances of parliament. Backbench Labour MPs and some soft Brexit Tories had fought to get concessions into the previous versions of the bill, but Johnson no longer has any need for their votes as he has a majority of 80. Labour is expected to vote against the bill, along with the Lib Dems and the SNP. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, accused Johnson of having 'deliberately resurrected the threat of no deal at the end of next year, which would decimate industry and destroy people's jobs'ù. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader, said the bill would hurt Scotland's economy and cost thousands of jobs north of the border, taking a 'wrecking ball to our economic and social foundations'ù. Conservative MPs cheered as the House of Commons agreed to sit on Friday for the second reading of the bill. ",-0.125,Negative
UK's Brexit department to be wound up after 31 January,0,Neutral,"The Department for Exiting the European Union is to be wound up once the UK leaves the bloc at the end of January. A government spokesperson said staff in the department, created by Theresa May following the referendum result in 2016, had been informed. 'We are very grateful for all their work and we will help everyone to find new roles,'the spokesperson said. The news comes amid reports of the government's intention to change the language used to describe the UK's exit from the EU in order to reinforce the idea that 'Brexit is done'ù. According to the Huffington Post, the prime minister has ordered officials to drop the term 'Brexit'once the withdrawal agreement is passed and the UK leaves the EU on 31 January as planned. The website reports that No 10's Brexit press team will be renamed after that, with 'Europe and economy'one new name being floated by officials. Asked about the reports, a government spokesperson said: 'I think the PM is very clear that on 31 January we will have got Brexit done and then the focus will be on the future relationship with the European Union.'Asked if the prime minister's spokespeople would use the word after that point, one said: 'I think it's a word that will be with us for a long time to come.'MPs are expected to vote on Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement bill on Friday, with the Conservative party's 80-seat majority allowing for its swift passage through parliament. The bill could pass through the Commons by 10 January and through the Lords one or two weeks later. The UK will then enter the so-called implementation period, during which it will be closely aligned to EU rules, until 31 December 2020. Johnson has insisted that he can secure a trade deal by then, despite criticism that 11 months is an unprecedentedly short time for such a complex negotiation. The Department for Exiting the European Union, also known as DExEU, was established in July 2016 to 'oversee negotiations to leave the EU and establish the future relationship between the UK and EU'ù. The department was formed by combining staff from the Cabinet Office's Europe unit, the Europe directorate of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and the UK's permanent representation to the EU. DExEU has been headed by three Brexit secretaries: David Davis; Dominic Raab, now the foreign secretary; and most recently by Stephen Barclay. ",0,Neutral
"Lower courts can roll back EU laws after Brexit, No 10 confirms",-0.25,Negative,"Downing Street has confirmed a plan to allow lower courts to roll back EU legal rulings following Brexit, a plan that prompted concerns that it will become easier to challenge European standards in areas such as workers' rights and the environment. Under plans made by Theresa May, the incorporation of all EU case law made by the European court of justice into UK law after departure would have left the supreme court as the only body able to overturn these decisions. But asked about reports that Boris Johnson had ignored concerns from some ministers and decided to allow lower courts the same power, his spokesman confirmed that this would be part of the new withdrawal agreement bill. The revised bill, which puts Johnson's Brexit plan into law, is due to be published imminently, and will face its first vote from MPs on Friday, when it is due to have its first and second reading. The spokesman said: 'The bill will ensure that the supreme court is not the only institution able to consider retained European court of justice rulings. This is an important change, which will ensure that we do not face a legal bottleneck and inadvertently stay bound by EU rulings for many years. 'We will take back control of our laws and disentangle ourselves from the EU's legal order, just as was promised to the British people.'Asked if this would make it easier for rights such as those on employment to be rolled back, the spokesman said: 'These will be matter for British courts. In relation to workers' rights, there is a commitment by the government in its manifesto, which will be honoured in full, to ensure that we protect and enhance workers' rights. And that will be done in UK law.'It is understood that legislation on maintaining workers' rights will form part of the Queen's speech, the outline of the government's legislative plan, which will take place on Thursday following the state opening of parliament.

Pound slides to pre-election levels in wake of bid to outlaw Brexit extension,-0.5,Negative,"The pound has given up the gains made since the general election after Boris Johnson said he would write Britain's exit from the EU next year into law without an extension in the transition period. Sterling tumbled by about two cents against the dollar and the euro on the international money markets, as the decision to enshrine time-limited Brexit negotiations into law caught investors by surprise. The pound came under heavy selling pressure on the foreign exchanges, falling to about $1.31 against the dollar and to about £1.18 against the euro, reversing all the post-election gains made since Thursday evening last week. Johnson's move set alarm bells ringing in the City, where bosses and investors have largely been anticipating that the year-long Brexit transition period until the end of December 2020 would likely be extended. Should ministers fail to agree a deal by the end of next year, Britain would likely exit the EU and continue a relationship with its most significant trading partner on World Trade Organization terms, a move investors in the City believe would damage the UK economy. The Confederation of British Industry, the country's leading business lobby group, warned ministers that the speed they were taking to reach an agreement must not compromise quality. It added: 'The economy cannot afford another no-deal cliff-edge in December 2020 and needs a deep and ambitious deal that protects the UK services and secures the necessary regulatory cooperation for the industries that need it.'Investors had expected the currency to come under pressure next year as Johnson faces the complex process of striking a far-reaching trade deal with the EU in less than a year. Most international trade deals take much longer to agree. Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at the financial trading firm IG, said: 'With Johnson introducing yet another needless cliff-edge, he has dented hopes of a sentiment driven boost in economic activity which has in turn put an end to the recent recovery in UK markets.'",-0.125,Negative
Michael Gove fails to rule out no-deal Brexit,0.25,Positive,"Michael Gove has declined to rule out the possibility of a no-deal Brexit as he was challenged over the government's decision to make it illegal to request an extension to EU alignment beyond 2020. In its first major announcement since securing a majority in the general election, the government said it would enshrine in law a ban on extending the transition period on a Brexit deal with the EU. This is being seen as an attempt to push the European Union to give Boris Johnson a comprehensive free trade deal in less than 11 months by presenting the bloc with a new cliff-edge. The new Brexit deal is essentially the old†Brexit†deal with a new chapter on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and a few key tweaks to the political declaration. Here is a†link to the full text. The backstop is replaced The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly. Consent Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years. The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a 'backstop'but with a permanent tinge. That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020. Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not. Checks on border, ports and airports Under the deal, the UK and the EU are 'underlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland'ù. Future trade deals The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that 'the United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas'in any future trade talks has been ditched. Customs Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods. No customs duties will be payable on 'personal property'being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use. Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above. A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed. West/east trade The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated. VAT EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland. Single electricity market The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change. Level playing field This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement. Lisa O'Carroll†Brexit correspondent The extension ban will be written into the withdrawal agreement bill, which is due to have its second reading in the Commons on Friday. However, questions have been raised over what happens if an agreement is not struck with the EU by the end of 2020. Gove's comments came as the prime minister told colleagues at the first cabinet meeting since the Tory landslide election result that they must work '24 hours a day'to create a 'people's government'ù. Johnson said to ministers gathered around the cabinet table in Downing Street that they must work to repay voters who lent them their support at the ballot box.  'The first 100 days were very busy. You may remember it was a very frenetic time. But you ain't seen nothing yet, folks. We're going to have to work even harder because people have a very high level of expectation and we must deliver for them.' Appearing on BBC Breakfast, Gove, who has been in charge of no-deal planning, was asked four times if the new arrangement meant there was still a possibility of a no-deal hard Brexit, which MPs tried repeatedly in the Commons to prevent happening through legislation enacted by the Labour MP Hilary Benn. He said: 'No, the Brexit we are committed to delivering is the one in our manifesto. We need to make sure we honour that. That is a commitment we have to keep.'The UK is due to leave the EU's institutions on 31 January, subject to parliament's approval, and enter a transitional phase where it will remain aligned to the EU's single market and customs union until other arrangements are in place. During this time it will not have any voting rights. The transition period comes to an end on 31 December 2020. It was possible to extend it by up to two years by making a request by July but the government is scrapping that option. Gove was asked again if the UK would still formally leave the EU if no agreement had been reached with European leaders, and said both sides knew they had to reach a deal. He said: 'We are going to leave the European Union on 31 January because of the withdrawal agreement. And then the political declaration, which goes alongside the withdrawal agreement, commits both sides to making sure that the follow-up conversations are concluded by the end of 2020.'Asked if the government could miss this timescale with no deal in place, he said: 'No. We are going to make sure we get this deal done in time.'Accused of avoiding the question, he said: 'We will get a deal and the political declaration commits both sides to that.'The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, who is expected to run for the position of Labour party leader, criticised the government's decision to ban another extension because it risks the UK leaving without a deal. He said: 'This is typical of the reckless and irresponsible behaviour we have come to expect from Boris Johnson's Government. 'The Tories have shown once again that they are prepared to put people's jobs at risk in pursuit of a hard Brexit. Gove told Radio 5 Live that their plan to legislate for Brexit to take place by the end of 2020 was a way of 'keeping faith with the British public'ù. He said a deadline would 'concentrate minds'among the EU leaders to try to secure a trade deal.  ",0.875,Positive
Brexit: Boris Johnson's plan set to be put before MPs on Friday,0.125,Positive,"The newly elected House of Commons is likely to have its first vote on Boris Johnson's Brexit plan on Friday, Downing Street has said, in the first stage of the Conservative-majority government's plan to get the UK out of the EU on 31 January. The news comes as No 10 also said the prime minister had finally approved for publication a report examining Russian infiltration in British politics, which was controversially held up before the election. Johnson's spokesman said parliament's intelligence and security committee (ISC) report had been cleared by the PM, but would not be published until the new incarnation of the committee was assembled to formally approve this. Under the Brexit plans, the withdrawal agreement bill, which sets out the legal framework for the deal, will be submitted to MPs on Friday. While the Commons resumes on Tuesday, the timetable will initially be taken up with two days of swearing-in MPs, followed by the state opening of parliament and the Queen's speech. The new Brexit deal is essentially the old†Brexit†deal with a new chapter on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and a few key tweaks to the political declaration. Here is a†link to the full text. The backstop is replaced The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly. Consent Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years. The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a 'backstop'but with a permanent tinge. That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020. Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not. Checks on border, ports and airports Under the deal, the UK and the EU are 'underlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland'ù. Future trade deals The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that 'the United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas'in any future trade talks has been ditched. Customs Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods. No customs duties will be payable on 'personal property'being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use. Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above. A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed. West/east trade The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated. VAT EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland. Single electricity market The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change. Level playing field This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement. Lisa O'Carroll†Brexit correspondent Johnson's spokesman said: 'We plan to start the process before Christmas and will do so in the proper, constitutional way, in discussion with the Speaker.'It is understood the plan for Friday is to give the bill its first reading, a formality not involving a debate, and then the second reading, which involves a debate as well as a vote. However, having both on the same day will need the formal approval of the new Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle. Johnson's spokesman declined to give any details on what the bill might involve, and how it might differ from the version published in October. The bill will be published before Friday, but it is not clear when. 'We will present a bill which will ensure we get Brexit done before the end of January. It will reflect the agreement made with the EU on our withdrawal,'he said. 'The PM made clear during the general election campaign that he would be aiming for a Canada-style free trade agreement with no political alignment.'Pressed for details, the spokesman said: 'I'm not going to discuss the precise nature of the negotiations on the free trade agreement. The prime minister has just won a very clear mandate to deliver Brexit. We're focused on getting the withdrawal agreement bill though the House of Commons and leaving the EU on 31 January.'The rapid approval for publication of the report into Russian interference is likely to increase speculation that No 10 sought to suppress it before the election. The decision by Downing Street to not allow the 50-page dossier to be published before the election was described by the chairman of the outgoing committee, Dominic Grieve, as 'jaw-dropping'ù. Labour and Scottish National party politicians accused No 10 of refusing to recognise the scale of Russian meddling. Johnson's spokesman said: 'In line with his responsibilities under the Justice and Security Act 2013, the prime minister carefully considered the report of the former committee. He is content publication would not prejudice the functions of those bodies that safeguard national security. Publication will be a matter for the new ISC in due course.'Asked when Johnson had made the decision, the spokesman declined to say: 'He has looked at the report since it was submitted to him last month and is satisfied it is cleared for publication.'However, the report is unlikely to published for some weeks, given that this has to be done by the new committee. Members have to be appointed by Johnson, in conjunction with the leader of the opposition, then have to be security cleared to examine confidential intelligence documents. ",0.625,Positive
"UK not 'match fit' for Brexit talks, says former May aide",-0.75,Negative,"The government is not 'match fit'for the next phase of Brexit negotiations, Theresa May's former special adviser on exiting the EU has said. Raoul Ruparel, who was credited with coming up with the Northern Ireland solution which helped Boris Johnson seal a Brexit deal with the EU, says lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of May's government. 'As it stands, the UK does not yet appear 'òmatch-fit' for the next phase of negotiations,'he says. 'There is a huge amount of work to be done to flesh out the detail of what the UK wants from its future relationship with the EU, and Whitehall is not yet ready to negotiate such a complex and wide-ranging agreement, nor implement it.'May's former adviser says that contrary to what many believe 'it is possible to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of next year'ù. But he warns that it could only be 'narrow'in scope. In a report for the Institute for Government, Ruparel is scathing about the UK's approach to negotiations in the first phase. The 'real error was the UK never properly considered what approach and structure would suit its own goals best or put forward an alternative'while the EU was constantly on the front foot, with policy decisions translated into legal text before the UK had worked out its own position. He also says much of the work done under the May government in Whitehall will now be irrelevant. His words echo advice from many trade deal experts who say the UK has to learn from its mistakes and set out its wishlists and red lines clearly and publicly as is the convention in international negotiations. The EU has already indicated its red lines before the new government has even got to work on precisely who, or what government department, will lead its negotiations. Talks in February will open with an EU demand of alignment with union rules. EU leaders warned on Friday that the price of a quick deal including tariff-free access to the single market would be agreeing to the level playing field on workers' rights and environmental protections. Ruparel says one of the main decisions facing Johnson is whether he wants an overarching ambitious deal, known as a 'mixed agreement'ù, covering the entire gamut of the future political relationship, including security, data, aviation, science and education. That would take years to negotiate. The alternative is a deal that 'only engages with EU exclusive competence'ù, one that would only require approval of the commission and the parliament and not individual governments which, for example, took a year to ratify the EU-Canada deal. The latter would 'limit the scope of any agreement, resulting in what might be termed a shallow and narrow future relationship'ù, he warns. At the moment Whitehall is not set up for a wide-ranging and complex negotiation, he says. There has been speculation that the Department for Exiting the EU could fold, and Ruparel says it is likely that the department will have to be wound down. 'Since its inception, the department has suffered from a poorly defined role,'he says. Ruparel says there are three options for negotiations: run a narrow central unit out of No 10 or the Cabinet Office with expert advice feeding in from across Whitehall; set up a larger unit within the Cabinet Office with sufficient expertise to challenge other Whitehall departments; or revamp the Department for International Trade. Given the limited time to build the team and seal a comprehensive deal with the EU, one option would be to pursue a phased deal. This would mean a targeted narrow Brexit deal by the end of 2020, as the building blocks for 'a more ambitious and comprehensive relationship'over time. This, Ruparel warns, would not be supported by businesses, who would favour just one change to their supply chains and operations. ",-0.25,Negative
Johnson is warned his big win will not speed up Brexit deal,0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson has been warned that his large majority will not help him solve the contradictions at the heart of his Brexit plans, amid attempts by the European Union to head off another crisis at the end of next year. The prime minister has made clear that he will immediately push on with plans to implement his Brexit deal, ensuring that Britain will leave the EU by the end of January. However, he is already being warned that his 80-strong majority will not hand him any extra power in his negotiations with Brussels. There are concerns in Europe and Westminster that his commitment not to extend the Brexit transition period beyond 2020 also risks exposing critical parts of Britain's economy. Sir Ivan Rogers, Britain's former envoy to the EU, told the Observer that the time pressures created by Johnson's commitments could force Britain into accepting major concessions. He also doubted that the size of the parliamentary majority would change the debate with Brussels. 'People always think that, but this is the category error that we always make,'he said. 'That somehow the strength of your mandate and majority at home makes the slightest difference to how the other side negotiates. 'It's not totally a repeat game, but it's essentially the same methodology as 2017, and [the EU] almost certainly think they have the UK somewhat over a barrel, given the prime minister's self-imposed very tight time pressure in saying he will under no circumstances extend the transition.'Rogers added that Johnson had not resolved a central contradiction in his plans - that he appeared to want Britain to diverge from EU rules, while also wanting a comprehensive trade deal in place in just a year's time. 'It's because you say you have no intention of remaining aligned that the negotiation will take the time,'he said. 'What exactly is the point of Johnson's Brexit as opposed to [Theresa] May's if he is actually saying that he wishes to remain aligned? The endless ambiguity and telling all sides what they want to hear ends when you start negotiating. See what he does, not what he says.'The new president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, conceded on Friday that negotiating a future relationship in such a tight time frame would be 'very challenging'ù. She said the negotiations would instead have to prioritise key EU issues, such as the trade in goods and fisheries, and leave others for after 2020. That could leave arrangements for the UK's financial services sector and the landing rights of British air carriers out of an initial deal. Such a staged approach would be unwelcome in Downing Street and would, in itself, be difficult to complete. Brussels is already grappling with the problem posed by Johnson's position and the short time-frame. The Observer has learned that EU leaders could yet take the initiative and request an extension to the Brexit transition period from the UK.  It is understood initial discussions have taken place in Brussels about the EU taking the initiative and asking for its own extension from the British government. It is likely that the bloc would also need to sweeten the offer of an extension by minimising the costs the UK would face. Sources suggest that such a move might offer Johnson a better chance of gaining cabinet approval, and avoid a cliff-edge exit from the EU's structures next 31 December, including the imposition of tariffs. Johnson's withdrawal agreement stipulates the transition can be extended by 'one or two years'but must be agreed before next July. The development highlights the difficulties facing the negotiators as they prepare for talks. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said on Friday he feared the negotiations would be far tougher than those over the withdrawal agreement. The debate over the future EU trade deal within the new-look Tory party, and how close MPs want Britain to remain to the bloc, is also unpredictable. There are genuine concerns inside the prime minister's team that the size of the new Conservative intake means some MPs are unknown quantities. It has also made it hard to calculate the balance in terms of their positions and aims for Brexit, beyond support for the manifesto pledge to formally leave the EU by the end of January. Many Tory MPs believe Johnson's large victory will allow him to ignore the hardline European Research Group of MPs, which includes Jacob Rees-Mogg, which has pushed for a hard Brexit that would see the UK drift away from EU rules and standards. However, it is unclear how strong the ERG will be in the new parliament. ",0,Neutral
The Observer view on where Britain goes after the general election result,0,Neutral,"This is the most decisive election result for over a decade. Boris Johnson asked the country for a mandate to 'get Brexit done'ù, and last Thursday voters delivered him an overwhelming majority. The result settles once and for all the vexed question of when and whether we will leave the European Union: Britain's formal exit will happen at the end of next month. But the conclusiveness of the result should not obscure the massive uncertainty that hangs over our future: over what type of Brexit we choose once we have left, a decision that will have huge implications for our economic wellbeing and the integrity of the union. This is the largest Conservative majority the country has seen since 1987, delivered on the biggest share of the vote won by any party since Margaret Thatcher's first victory in 1979. For Labour, this defeat is its fourth in a row, producing the smallest cohort of MPs the party has seen since 1935. Britain's electoral map has been upended as the Conservatives have swept to victory with a raft of seats in the north and the Midlands that were not so long ago seen as impregnable Labour strongholds. This new political reality leaves challenges for Britain's political leaders. A newly triumphantJohnson leads a party stunned by the scale of its victory, a party that will have to confront the challenge of delivering Brexit without inflicting enormous damage on its fragile new electoral coalition. Nicola Sturgeon has been returned with a fresh mandate to champion Scottish independence but no obvious route to securing an independence referendum. Labour and the Liberal Democrats face months of agonising introspection and internal conflict as they embark on the process of choosing new leaders adequate to the task of rebuilding their shattered parties, and finding ways to reconnect with the voters who abandoned them. From his podium outside Downing Street last Friday, Johnson struck a tone of unity and inclusion, in sharp contrast to the tenor of his divisive election campaign. He pledged to lead a 'one nation'Conservative government that will bring together the nations of the United Kingdom, and reflect the sentiments of both those who voted to Leave and to Remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. It is hard to overstate how dramatic a shift from the Tory approach to governing witnessed over the past nine years this would require. It would demand an entirely different strategy for achieving a new relationship with the EU from the one Johnson has pursued to date; an undoing of the painful austerity of the past decade that has most sharply hit low-income families and less affluent areas; and an unravelling of the toxic legacy of Theresa May's hostile environment. Leaving the EU on 31 January 2020 under the terms of the withdrawal agreement will not see 'Brexit done'in any but the most superficial sense. Our exit will be only the start of the conversation about what our final relationship with the EU will look like. Do we want a closely aligned relationship, which would minimise the economic damage and protect the Good Friday agreement? Or do we want to diverge sharply from European regulations and standards in order to align more closely with the low-regulation economy of the United States and end free movement, the price of which would be sharpening economic inequalities, a grave risk to the union and a watering-down of worker and consumer protections? Like May before him, Johnson has always prioritised his own political interest over that of the country. The absence of a Conservative majority since 2017 has given undue influence to the hard Eurosceptic flank of the party, and both May and Johnson have been willing to dance to its tune as the price of its support. Johnson has been willing to pursue the hardest of Brexits, which would risk the integrity of the union and impose huge economic pain, as the price of power. His resounding election victory must shift this calculus. Not only does it reduce the influence of his party's most fanatical Eurosceptics; it has brought in a fresh wave of MPs who represent areas of the country whose economies would be wrecked by a hard Brexit. This provides him with the political imperative to tack towards a soft Brexit that minimises its economic impact, protects the union and recognises that over half of voters did not give his version of Brexit their seal of approval last week. The same imperative operates when it comes to reversing the past decade of spending cuts. Johnson's manifesto offered far too little on this, including nothing about the slashing of tax credits that has left many working parents thousands of pounds a year worse off. By 2023, more than half of families with children will have been shifted on to universal credit - which is far less generous than the system it replaces - and many of these will be new Conservative voters, living in constituencies with new Conservative MPs. Johnson ignores this at his peril. But while his majority could push him towards a softened approach, his election campaign risks an altogether different political legacy. Johnson will no doubt extract a dangerous lesson from his win: that putting out untrue claims about your opponents, blaming them for events that happen on your watch, and avoiding scrutiny at all costs is an effective political strategy. At least he can no longer rely on the toxic, populist narrative of 'people versus parliament'ù. He controls the Commons. If in five years, Britain is languishing in the wake of a catastrophic Brexit, the responsibility will lie with him, and him alone. Corbyn's momentous defeat leaves Labour with different dilemmas. The party has lost more than 2.5 million voters in just two years. But there were still more voters who did not endorse Johnson than those who did; many of whom will fear the consequences of another five years of Conservative government. Labour owes it to them to undertake a full and honest reflection of why it lost, rather than descending into sectarian blame games. Supporters of Corbyn have tried to write off Labour's losses as a consequence of Brexit above all else. On this account, the referendum created a lose-lose situation by opening up a new cleavage that divided Labour's electoral coalition. In eventually swinging behind support for a referendum on any deal, Labour sacrificed its heartland support. Those who have spent the past two years arguing for a referendum - this newspaper included - must take stock and reflect why the case never resonated with enough MPs and voters for it to happen. But Labour's lack of leadership on Brexit - its abject refusal to adopt a clear position early on - undoubtedly did the argument for a fresh referendum significant damage. Labour's problems go beyond Brexit. Its vote share declined most in Leave-supporting areas, but also dropped in areas of the country that voted to Remain. Polling suggests that the most important factor in voters deserting the party for the Conservatives was not Brexit, but Corbyn's leadership, reinforcing reports from Labour MPs throughout the campaign. And Brexit is a symptom of Labour's problems in its heartlands, not the cause. Under our electoral system, Labour can only win decent majorities by building a coalition of socially liberal and socially conservative voters from every corner of the UK. The decline in working-class support for Labour has been long-term and structural. While we have always recognised that Corbyn energised a new generation of members and activists, it has been clear that he was not the leader to address this long-term structural decline. There have been plenty of warning signals, including the no confidence motion backed by over 80% of the parliamentary party in 2016. Dire personal ratings added to the picture. Still, Corbyn - hampered by an evident deficit in political skills and strategic vision, encumbered instead by a worn-out and irrelevant set of dogmas - persisted in the belief that he was right, and his critics wrong. The dreadful price is that Labour looks further away than ever from delivering for the communities most in need of a Labour government. Now Corbyn must accept the voters' verdict: they did not see in him a prime minister; they did not see in his manifesto a credible agenda for change. He cannot lead the Labour party through the painful reflection it must now undertake; he must resign with immediate effect, paving the way for a caretaker leader. The danger is that the forthcoming leadership contest will quickly become dominated by factional infighting rather than an honest debate about what Labour needs. The party's members have an awesome responsibility ahead: to select a new leader who can excite younger voters, while rebuilding bridges with those working-class voters who deserted it, and who will not shy from confronting head-on the antisemitism crisis that has engulfed the party in recent years. This election may have shaken up Britain's electoral landscape, but none of the existential questions facing our country have gone away. How do we balance the trade-offs involved in Brexit? What is the UK's future as a union of four nations? How do we make it a greener and kinder country in which to live, in which older people do not go without basic care and children get an equal chance in life regardless of who their parents are? Labour has, for now, forfeited its chance to lead a government to address these challenges, and the country's immediate future yet again lies in the hands of a Conservative prime minister. For the fourth time in a decade, the party must embark on the process of reflection and rebuilding. Britain cannot afford for it to make the wrong choice again. ",0,Neutral
EU looks at extending Brexit transition period beyond 2020,0,Neutral,"EU leaders would take the initiative and request an extension to the transition period, keeping the UK under Brussels regulations beyond 2020, under a plan mooted for getting around Boris Johnson's stated refusal to seek a delay. The move is being considered by EU officials as a way out of the problem posed by the short time available to negotiate a new relationship and the prime minister's insistence that he will not seek an extension beyond 11 months. With a majority of 80 secured by the prime minister, the UK is expected to leave the EU on 31 January - in fewer than 50 days. At the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, the UK is set to exit the EU's customs union and single market and enter newly negotiated arrangements. Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission's president, said that negotiating a future relationship in such a short timeframe would be very challenging. Speaking on Friday, at the end of a leaders' summit in Brussels, she said the negotiations would instead have to prioritise key EU issues, such as the trade in goods and fisheries, and leave others for after 2020. Such a 'sequencing'could leave arrangements for the UK's financial services sector and the landing rights of British air carriers, among other issues, out of an initial deal. Such a staged approach would be unwelcome in Downing Street and would, in itself, be difficult to complete given the clashes expected on both the UK's future alignment with EU laws and the level of access to British waters given to European fishing fleets. The withdrawal agreement stipulates that the transition can be extended by 'one or two years'but that this must be agreed before 1 July next year. It is recognised in Brussels that Johnson will find it politically impossible to seek an extension to the transition to allow all the issues to be agreed. On breaking his word by asking for a delay, Johnson would have to open negotiations on how much extra the UK would pay into the EU budget. Free movement of people would also continue. Instead, it is understood initial discussions have taken place in Brussels about the EU asking the British government for an extension, given the complexity of the talks. It is likely that the EU would also need to sweeten the offer of an extension by minimising the costs that the UK would face. Sources suggested that such a move might offer Johnson a better chance of gaining cabinet approval, and avoid a cliff-edge exit from the EU's structures on 31 December 2020, including the imposition of tariffs. The development highlights the difficulties facing the negotiators as they prepare for talks. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said on Friday that he believed the negotiations in the next year would be far tougher than those over the withdrawal agreement. Some EU capitals were left frustrated by Von der Leyen's comments about the need to sequence the talks, believing it risked antagonising the UK. Mujtaba Rahman, a former European commission official and now managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm, said: 'The EU side hasn't fully agreed how best to handle phase two and the big internal debate in Europe is about prioritisation. The commission wants to prioritise talks - akin to how it favoured sequencing in phase one '™- and start with the areas where there's no fallback, such as the free-trade agreement, level playing field and governance. 'But EU capitals do not, as member states, worry about pre-judging Johnson's preferences and his ability to make difficult concessions if the things that UK wants aren't on table at the outset, such as services.'",0,Neutral
"The battle for EU membership is lost, but a European England is still possible",-0.125,Negative,"History to the defeated / May say Alas but cannot help or pardon.'WH Auden's lines from the Spanish civil war now apply to the British Europeans. We fought to keep our country in the European Union and we lost. The half of Britain that wants to leave the EU was united around Boris Johnson while the half that still wants to remain in the EU was divided against itself, and weighed down by the electoral liability called Jeremy Corbyn. If the deceptive but effective three-word slogan 'take back control'won the 2016 referendum, so the equally effective and deceptive three-word slogan 'get Brexit done'won this election. Even if voters knew somewhere in the back of their minds that it was too good to be true, in their hearts they wanted it to be. And let's be honest: even the most passionate of us remainers had some hidden 'get Brexit done'corner of our souls. But now I answer Auden with a great saying from the leader of Poland's struggle for independence in the early 20th century, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski: 'To be defeated and not give up, that is victory. To be victorious and rest on your laurels, that is defeat.'One of the many unpleasant experiences awaiting us in Britain over the next months is to hear silver-tongued demagogues such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, who have done more than anyone to tear this country apart, now smoothly repeating the mantra of 'bringing the country together'ù. Yet the likely consequence of Brexit is not just that the United Kingdom will be weaker, poorer and less influential, but that it will in effect cease to exist as a single state. That is the other clear signal from this election. Under Johnson's EU withdrawal deal, Northern Ireland will already be in a different economic and legal space from England, Scotland and Wales. Now Northern Ireland has, for the first time, elected more nationalist than unionist MPs. While it will probably remain constitutionally part of the UK for some time to come, since a formal break could return the province to bloodshed, in reality it will be ever more integrated with the rest of the island of Ireland. Scotland, meanwhile, has voted as emphatically for the Scottish National party (SNP) as England did for the Conservatives - and that on an explicit SNP commitment to a second Scottish referendum in which Nicola Sturgeon's party will argue for Scotland to leave the British union in order to rejoin the European one. As an Englishman, I want Scotland to stay with us, to enhance the strength, diversity and openness of the multinational nation that is Britain. There are also strong economic and prudential arguments for Scotland to stick with England. But if I were Scottish, I would now probably vote for independence, knowing that small countries generally do rather well inside the EU. If Johnson continues to deny the Scots the right to a second referendum, that will make them even more likely to eventually vote for independence, when the opportunity does arise. That result would take us back to the 17th century, before the 1707 union, and some would even say back to the 16th century, when only England and Wales were united under one sovereign. There is a huge irony here. Brexit, which has been fuelled at the top by English post-imperial delusions of grandeur, is the very thing that will probably end up demolishing even the original, smallest English empire, the one embracing these islands. All this will take years to unfold, and the final denouement is not inevitable. Maybe the Scots will after all stick with the devil they know. But it is not too soon for us liberals - in the broadest sense - to start fighting the battle of England. Brexit is at heart an English nationalist project. The flag of St George, the language, the mystique, the emotional appeal of England and Englishness have been misappropriated by nationalists and xenophobes, not to mention those even further to the right, such as Tommy Robinson once of the soi-disant English Defence League. But England is so much bigger and better than that. Even on its own, England would still be a fair-sized European country, with extraordinary strengths in creative industries, world-class media and universities, financial services, the cosmopolitan republic of greater London, sport, medical science and digital innovation. It has an exceptional, continuous history of 10 centuries as a nation with its own laws and traditions of self-government. It is also the country of John Milton, John Lilburne, John Stuart Mill, Charles Dickens and George Orwell: open-minded, bold, tolerant and big-hearted. For all the changes wrought by the centuries, we can still recognise the people described by Milton in 1644: 'A nation not slow and dull, but of quick, ingenious and piercing spirit; acute to invent, subtle and sinewy to discourse, not beneath the reach of any point the highest that human capacity can soar to.'Enriched and enlivened by decades of immigration, we are still that nation, for these characteristics are cultural, not predetermined by birth. Unfortunately we are again, as Orwell wrote in 1941, 'a family with the wrong members in control'ù. But 'still, it is a family'ù. The battle to keep Britain in the EU is lost; the battle for a European England has only just begun. When we remainers marched in our hundreds of thousands through the streets of London, bearing our improvised posters and European flags, we were not just defending British membership in a particular set of European institutions. We were also defending a certain idea of Britain and, within that, a certain idea of England: open, tolerant, internationalist, civic and civil, attentive to the social foundations of individual liberty and not just to its raw economic expression. These are values we share with millions of other Europeans. In this sense, we were also standing up for a European England. And we can do so still.

Rekindle kindness and empathy between remainers and leavers,0,Neutral,"Philip Pullman asks what we must do to rekindle kindness, empathy and cooperation (Drip by drip, this country has been poisoned, Journal, 11 December). The Brexit 'debate'has taught me the importance of listening and trying to understand where other people are coming from. Not all Brexiters are racist, ignorant and too stupid to understand the issues, any more than all remainers are comfortable, self-righteous and unpatriotic. Sadly, there are few places where remainers and Brexiters actually meet and listen to each other. David Goodhart describes in The Road to Somewhere two tribes with different values: the anywhere people and the somewhere people. This analysis was not well received by most liberal or left-leaning people, many of whom were quicker to criticise the other than look in the mirror. I have been shocked by the anger and lack of empathy among many remainers towards Brexiters. In the complex system that underlies social-political life, hostility creates a loop that only makes the other side more virulent and intransigent, and vice versa. In partial answer to Philip Pullman's question, we need to get off social media and make an effort to meet and understand those with whom we disagree. This is necessary (though not sufficient) to restore empathy.James PittYork '¢ I was surprised Aditya Chakrabortty (The truth about Labour leavers: they feel locked out of politics, Journal, 12 December) was able to distance himself from the attitude towards leave voters summed up in the phrase: 'Oh those idiots who don't know what they voted for'ù, because this sentiment has dripped from the pages of his (and my) newspaper for the last three and a half years. But it is not just ignorance of which Brexit voters are accused, it is something far more vicious. This was eloquently stated by Philip Pullman: 'I'm coming more and more to believe there's something in us that relishes wickedness and nourishes stupidity '¶ that something was kept in check by other equally ancient human impulses: kindness, empathy, cooperation. But the balance has swung the other way - perhaps not by much; perhaps by 52% to 48%.'ùDerek MatthewsNewcastle-on-Clun, Shropshire '¢ I reread Philip Pullman's piece after the election results and it made me cry.

"For Johnson's Tories, the collapse of public trust isn't a problem - it's an opportunity",-0.375,Negative,"After a chaotic and surreal campaign, there was a comforting familiarity about the rituals of election night. Tories will rehearse their favourite fairytale - that the 'party of Thatcher'has finally rediscovered its 1980s mojo - while Labour retreats to its own comfort zone, of bitter internal feuding. But amid all this drama, there is a danger that we might forget how deeply abnormal the Conservative election campaign has been, and how frighteningly unfamiliar the impending government could be. The winning campaign strategy was simple: to make this the second referendum, to make it as exhausting as possible, and to make sure Labour's offer of yet another referendum look more exhausting still. The Tories' blank policy agenda - beyond passing the existing Brexit deal in January - was aimed directly at a group of voters who don't trust politicians, don't believe government can help them, and are done with listening to 'liberal elites'bickering over the precise number of hospitals the Tories will or won't build. For today's Conservatives, the collapse of trust in institutions isn't a problem - it's an opportunity. 'Get Brexit done'ù, like Donald Trump's 'build a wall'ù, was not a policy pledge so much as a mantra to identify with, for those who think the establishment is a stitch-up. Two other ingredients were necessary. First, a rightwing 'big tent'needed constructing, one that spreads all the way from Matt Hancock in the centre-right out to Tommy Robinson on the far right. Johnson repeatedly did just enough to communicate to former Brexit party voters that he was on their side. For the desperate men and women (but mostly men) living in the abandoned economic regions of the Midlands and north, for whom only a Trump figure would be enough to draw them to the polls, Johnson performed that role adequately. For well-off elderly voters, who had been seduced by Faragist visions of national identity, Johnson's dog whistles hit home. Study his 'apologies'for past Islamophobic comments, and you'll notice that they're never apologies at all - they are affirmations of his right to say 'what everyone is thinking'ù. Second, Johnson's media profile and contacts were leveraged to the hilt. By the end of the campaign, he was performing a kind of Jeremy Clarkson role - obliterating any democratic dialogue or interrogation by dressing up as a milkman or driving a forklift truck. 'Boris'began life as a construct of the Daily Telegraph and Have I Got News For You, but now exists as a genre of social media 'content'ù. Unlike in the heyday of broadcast and print media, propaganda now has to be lively and engaging in order to work. And so the election was not won by an ordinary political party, with policies, members and ideology. It was won by a single-issue new-media startup - you might call it Vote Boris - fronted by a TV star, which will now unveil a largely unknown policy agenda. The 2016 referendum result, together with the 'Boris'phenomenon, have created a Trojan horse, within which lurks who knows what. But the chances of it offering anything transformative to the former Labour voters of Blyth Valley or Bolsover, beyond the occasional culture-war titbit, are minimal. One thing we do know is that the Vote Boris campaign was funded by hedge funds and wealthy British entrepreneurs - just as they donated heavily to Vote Leave. But who knows what they get in return? It also seems safe to assume, on the evidence of Johnson's first few months in office, that his administration will be hostile to many basic norms of the constitution and the liberal public sphere. Meanwhile, a triumphant Dominic Cummings will have his eye on a drastic transformation of Whitehall and regulators, inspired by exotic forms of rationalism, game theory and the libertarian right. If the new Johnson government sustains its unprecedented relationship with the media of the past six weeks - threatening public service broadcasters, excluding the Daily Mirror from its campaign bus, seamless coordination with the conservative press, using 'Boris'to distract from every unwelcome news item - then it will be virtually impossible for it to be held to account for what it does. And having already rebranded itself as the 'people's government'ù, there is no reason to expect it will embrace normal democratic scrutiny or opposition. A combination of Brexit, decades of neglect and political alienation in Labour's heartlands, the new digital media ecology, and hints of frightening illiberalism could conspire to produce a form of democracy that looks more like Hungary or even Russia than the checks-and-balances system of liberal ideals. It's not that democracy will end, but that it will be reduced to a set of spectacles that the government is ultimately in command of, which everyone realises are 'fake'but that are sufficiently funny or soothing as to be tolerated. This may sound paranoid, but it is merely an extrapolation from the trends that are already in full sway. Just like Trump, Johnson's capacity to make headlines and change the subject means we can quickly forget how much damage he has already done, in less than six months - instead we are locked in a perpetual present, squabbling over the details of what he's doing right now. It's important to keep track. Challenging this juggernaut will be a far larger and more complex project than anything Her Majesty's opposition can do alone.

"The Brexit party folded, but make no mistake: Farage won it for Johnson",-0.5,Negative,"Until 11 November, many had assumed that Nigel Farage's Brexit party was revving up for a general election. But that morning, Farage told an audience of supporters and journalists in Hartlepool that his Brexit party would be standing down in 317 Conservative-held seats to avoid splitting the leave vote. The audience was stunned; there was muted applause after he finished. This election will be remembered as a resounding, crushing victory for Boris Johnson's Conservatives. Just as has happened countless times before, Farage will be written off and ridiculed for his party not winning a single seat. But that morning of 11 November was the single most important moment of the campaign. Farage won it for Johnson. The decision to stand down against the Tories was not an easy one. According to Ed Jankowski, who was the Brexit party's digital strategist until the middle of November before resigning, Farage was for a long time eager to stand in every seat and not stand down - as he was being pressured to do by his erstwhile Leave.EU ally Arron Banks. Farage instead kept pushing a leave alliance that the Tories were never likely to officially agree to. But as the Brexit party started to flag in the polls, Farage lost his nerve and gave in to those not wanting to challenge Conservative seats. In Farage's speech, and in the weeks following, he pledged to scoop up the leave vote in Labour heartlands and places people were unlikely to ever vote Tory. As for Jankowski, he told me that he pushed hard to get a detailed data set of Labour leavers. If he had stayed on, Jankowski says he would have pushed for the Brexit party to hone its digital content so that it made a strong emotional appeal to those voters. Instead of the sophisticated digital campaign Jankowski envisaged, the wheels seemed to come off the Brexit party campaign. Farage's close ally Alexandra Phillips, who used to be his head of media at Ukip, publicly criticised the decision to stand down, saying she felt 'disenfranchised'for not being able to vote Brexit party in her own Conservative-held constituency. Farage and the party chairman, Richard Tice, are also rumoured to have fallen out over strategy, with Farage no longer showing up in the seat Tice stood in Hartlepool. Farage spent the rest of the campaign travelling predominantly to Labour leave seats, albeit to greatly diminished crowds compared to the big rallies seen earlier in the year. But while the shine had gone from the Brexit party, and it ended up winning no seats, its campaign has had a major impact on the election. One of the early results of the election night, a Labour hold in Sunderland Central by 2,964 votes, was striking for the swing. Labour was down 13.4%, Conservatives up slightly by 2%, while the Brexit party had a swing of 11.6% from a standing start. When the first 10 seats were in, in mostly northern and Midlands seats, there was nearly a 10% drop for Labour, while the Conservatives were only up 2.1% and the Brexit party was scooping up a 6% swing.  In some places the Conservatives gained seats from Labour on modest swings, while the Brexit party got swings of more than 10%. In Don Valley, Caroline Flint's 2017 majority of 5,169 appears to have been swallowed up by the Brexit party - which won 6,247 votes as the Tories took the seat. A similar dynamic appears to have taken place in Tony Blair's former seat of Sedgefield. Farage, whatever you think of him, was right. Many Labour leavers, who couldn't bring themselves to vote Tory, did vote for the Brexit party. This wasn't the case everywhere. In the much-watched seat of Workington, the Brexit party won little more than 1,749 votes to the Conservatives' 20,488. It's not clear what happens to the Brexit party now, with a Conservative majority set to secure an exit from the EU. Farage has already registered the name of the Reform party. As this general election campaign wore on, Farage increasingly focused on radical reform - more direct democracy, scrapping of the House of Lords, a reformed electoral system. When I spoke to the Brexit party's Claire Fox in October, she saw Brexit as the gateway to a kind of bloodless revolution for British democratic institutions. Fox is part of a core of former Revolutionary Communist party figures who have flocked to the Brexit party and remained loyal to Farage, who ended up convening around Spiked, the rightwing media outlet. With Brexit a done deal, Farage himself is rumoured to be heading for the US to cash in via the lucrative speaker circuit. Farage basically admitted to Andrew Neil on election night that he would be giving stump speeches for Trump on the campaign trail for the US presidential election 2020. Wherever he ends up, and whatever happens to the Brexit party now, this election is the culmination of a long campaign to redraw the map of British politics, starting with Farage forcing David Cameron's hand in calling an EU referendum in the first place. Without Farage's decision to stand down against 317 Conservatives, the election would have been very different. Without going hard after Labour leavers, the Conservatives would not have a thumping majority. Although his party hasn't won a seat, and even if his campaign itself faltered, the untold story of this election is how Farage once again shaped events. He remains the b√™te noire of British politics. '¢ Darren Loucaides is a writer based in Barcelona and London ",-0.375,Negative
Whoever wins this election needs to show some humility,-0.375,Negative,"You lost. Get over it. Nothing sums up the sour mood of post-Brexit politics like that nasty little mantra, which erupted online immediately after the 2016 referendum and has lingered ever since. When leavers won their surprise victory they had a chance to respond magnanimously, inviting a bruised 48% into the process of deciding how to manage the departure and addressing their fears. But too many simply sneered at remainers instead, and so the divide hardened. Our toxic political culture is the price we have paid ever since for failing to secure losers' consent. There has been much talk lately of bringing the country back together, yet revisiting Brexit in a general election that was simultaneously about so many other starkly divisive issues has achieved the opposite. Losing always hurts, but with the two main parties poles apart on almost everything that matters and with so much at stake, this result may be harder than usual for the losing side to accept. Even so, it might not be too late to start trying to put the broken pieces back together. True, I'm writing this in the calm before the storm: that eerily still moment on polling day just after voting but before knowing the result, when anything is still possible even if most things seem unlikely. Soon, doors now ajar will be slamming shut. But whoever emerges victorious, whether instantly with a majority or slowly and only after prolonged horse-trading, should do so with a hefty dose of humility. It's not just the losers they need to convince this time. There will have been plenty of people thrilled on Thursday by the chance to vote for the politician of their dreams, but many others will have voted tactically, or while burying serious qualms. More than any I remember, this was an election when voters were urged to vote against rather than for something. Forget your nagging worries about Boris Johnson's mendacity or your unease about antisemitism in the Labour party; just feel the fear and vote to stop the other guy. Green, Lib Dem and other minority party voters have been guilt-tripped into abandoning their natural preference for fear of something worse. Whoever governs next will do so partly thanks to borrowed votes, and should be sobered by that knowledge. New prime ministers invariably reach for unifying words on the steps of Downing Street - even Margaret Thatcher quoted the prayer of St Francis of Assisi in 1979 - but few live up to them. This time, we need actions as well as words. Any attempt at national reconciliation must start with all those lately made to feel unwelcome in their own country. Many Jews have spoken of potentially fleeing Britain if Jeremy Corbyn won, but many ethnic minority voters have said they'd feel equally unsafe under Johnson; both may find it hard to forget other Britons' apparent willingness to throw them under the bus in an election, whatever the result. The hurt caused to EU nationals living in Britain when the Tory leader accused them of treating it like their 'own country'cannot be overestimated either, since for many the UK does feel like home. Whoever wins has a moral responsibility to repair the damage, committing to act promptly on any findings from the pending Equality and Human Rights Commission inquiry into Labour antisemitism and ensuring the much-promised inquiry into Islamophobia within the Conservative party actually happens; new MPs should resolve to represent EU nationals living in their constituencies as vigorously as if the latter had a vote. The second priority is ensuring that we never have an election campaign this dishonest again. Johnson has pushed against accepted political norms - the idea that political advertising stays roughly within the boundaries of truth, say, or that prospective leaders submit to searching interviews - and found them alarmingly flimsy. And if one party isn't playing by the rules, the others soon realise that doing so puts them at a competitive disadvantage. It will be for the new parliament to stop the rot. The lesson of the Westminster expenses scandal was that egregious cheating by some members of parliament rebounded on all of them, because after a while voters just stop distinguishing between individuals and assume that all of them are probably at it. So it is with lying: before long, nobody's words are believed.  News organisations should reconsider giving aspirant prime ministers free publicity for silly campaign stunts if they won't also do tough interviews. And while anonymous sources still serve important purposes in journalism, anyone routinely abusing the privilege in order to lie without accountability cannot expect to remain anonymous. Meanwhile, since the Institute for Fiscal Studies' warning that neither Labour nor Tory spending plans were economically credible had little discernible effect on either party, there's a good case, too, for pre-scrutiny of manifestos by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, as Labour's John McDonnell has suggested, so that voters can be sure the figures add up. But perhaps the biggest task facing this prime minister is to earn, not assume, national consent. That means leading in the broad national interest, not a narrow sectarian one; fostering the belief that those with whom you disagree may still have something worthwhile to contribute; and striving to represent the half of the country that will feel grievously cheated whatever comes of Brexit. We should have learned by now what happens when losers are simply left to stew in it. '¢ Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist '¢ This article was amended on 19 December 2019.

UK's post-Brexit trade at risk as WTO's top court shuts down,-0.25,Negative,"The UK is at risk of being left at the mercy of the EU in its trading relationship in a year's time after Donald Trump engineered the shutdown of the World Trade Organization's top court. The US president's refusal to approve the appointment or reappointment of any judges on the appellate body has left it unable to function. From midnight on Wednesday, the WTO court will no longer adjudicate on trade disputes, putting the world at risk of a free trade free-for-all in which the largest blocs have greater freedom to use their economic weight to do as they wish. Countries or trade blocs who have not negotiated bilateral trade deals containing dispute resolution mechanisms will have no independent means for resolving their problems with each other. If the UK leaves the EU on 31 January, Johnson has said he will not extend an 11-month transition period in which he wants to negotiate a comprehensive free trade deal with the bloc. A failure to complete those complex talks by the end of that period would result in the UK trading with the EU entirely on WTO terms, including the imposition of tariffs and quotas, from 1 January 2021. Under the terms of the transition period, the UK is to remain in the single market and EU customs union temporarily. Should the UK, once outside of those structures, come to believe that the EU is imposing vexatious barriers to trade, there would be no recourse to legal redress for the British government. WTO members are still be expected to comply with their international obligations. The EU would be expected to sincerely follow the terms to which they have signed up along with the 164 other members of the trade organisation. The WTO appellate body deals with the most extreme trade disputes. But the CBI has said the shutdown of the WTO court will leave global trade 'like a football match without referee'and the UK's lack of free trade agreements post-Brexit would leave the country's economy vulnerable. AndrÈ Sapir, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based thinktank Bruegel, said the UK would be left in 'legal limbo'ù. 'It is in the UK's interests for a solution to be found,'he said. 'Relying on WTO rules doesn't look so great this morning,'one EU official said. 'The WTO buccaneering Brexiteer alternative looks like hubris.'A number of senior Conservatives, including the former cabinet minister John Redwood, have previously championed leaving the EU without a trade deal. The EU is looking at building a shadow arbitration system as an interim solution but there is no agreement as yet within the bloc or internationally. The WTO was established in 1995 to deal with trade disputes. The UK will become an independent member if it leaves the EU. Phil Hogan, the European commissioner for trade, who will oversee the EU's negotiations with the UK, said: 'With the appellate body removed from the equation, we have lost an enforceable dispute settlement system that has been an independent guarantor - for large and small economies alike - that the WTO's rules are applied impartially.'",-0.25,Negative
Johnson pursues low-paid workers for £8k costs in Brexit case,0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson's lawyers are pursuing three low-paid workers and their union for at least £8,000 in court costs despite the prime minister breaking his promise on extending the Brexit deadline. The Labour shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has accused Johnson of 'vindictively pursuing'the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) and its members after it began high court proceedings earlier in the autumn to challenge Johnson's repeated threat to crash out of the European Union with a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.  The union dropped the case after it became clear Johnson would reluctantly seek an extension to the deadline as mandated by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act (No 2) 2019, also known as the Benn act, which required the prime minister to write to the EU seeking an extension to article 50 until 31 January in the absence of a deal.  The prime minister's lawyers are seeking to recover costs for the high court case from the IWGB and three of its members, who are cleaners and bicycle couriers, after they put their names to the original claim. The union has set up a fundraising appeal on the crowdjustice website to pay the bills. One of the claimants, Maritza Castillo Calle, said: 'Precarious migrant workers like myself have been terrified by the prospect of a no-deal Brexit and the impact it could have on our most basic rights. We decided to take action to protect our communities, but now, because Boris Johnson lied about his intention to not seek an extension, we are being asked to pay thousands of pounds. By handing us this bill, it's clear that this government for the rich is trying to intimidate ourselves and other working-class people from ever daring to hold it to account.'McDonnell said: 'This crowdfunder goes to the heart of why Boris is unfit to be prime minister. The PM lied, low-paid workers and their union bravely took action to hold him to account, the PM backtracked and is now vindictively pursuing them for legal costs. Low-paid workers standing up for their rights and the rule of law need to be supported, not attacked.'",0,Neutral
Britain's young people are radicalised and registered. Will this be our election?,0,Neutral,"Is the 'youthquake'of 2017 about to be upstaged? After just a glimpse at the voter registration figures for the upcoming election, it looks as if the next quake might chart even higher on the Richter scale. More than 3 million people registered to vote between the election being called and the deadline - 875,000 more than the same period in 2017 - and two-thirds of them were under 35. There was a lot of debate surrounding 2017's surge in young voting, including whether or not it actually happened. After a 'youthquake'was initially declared after the election, a widely reported paper based on the British Election Study claimed that there was no substantial rise in youth turnout - leading many to declare the 'youthquake'a myth. But more recent analysis from political scientists Patrick Sturgis and Will Jennings, indicating a large increase in turnout in 2017 among under-30s, suggests it was real after all. There is also much we don't know about how this year's youth registration spike will affect the final result on 13 December.  Young people are highly politicised, and for a number of reasons. The longer-term forces affecting young people are clear: we are driven towards political engagement because we are more likely to be in debt, working in the gig economy, and stuck in 'generation rent'as a result of Britain's Tory-run economy. But, to work out whether the latest surge in registrations will lead to another quake, we must understand how our concerns have only intensified since 2017. Take Brexit. Three-quarters of young people back a second referendum, and so the effect of watching three years of deadlock in parliament, alongside a swelling, youth-led People's Vote campaign, can't be overstated. In the two years that have elapsed since the last general election, news also broke of two notable Brexit scandals - Cambridge Analytica, and the revelation that the Vote Leave campaign broke electoral law. For young remainers who already felt let down by the referendum result, this election presents a genuine opportunity for a second referendum, or to simply reverse the decision altogether. Race and immigration also rank high on young people's agendas. Our demographic is more black, Asian and minority ethnic, and more likely to embrace multiculturalism, than older generations. We are aware of how hate crimes have risen, and how the far right has rapidly become our greatest threat. In the months following the referendum, I heard many young people of colour talk about feeling betrayed, feeling unwelcome in the UK, and expressing fears that racist undercurrents had risen to the surface. Our anger and hurt have only increased since, with stories like the Windrush scandal and a series of other headline Home Office decisions showing how our communities have been failed. The feeling that both the government and Brexit are continuing to hurt people of colour may serve as a motivator for us to turn out. Most broadcasters and politicians were always going to frame this as the 'Brexit election'ù, but there is another issue at the forefront of our minds. Young people will be around to feel the effects of the climate crisis for longer than our parents, and we have channelled our eco-anxiety into Extinction Rebellion and School Strike for Climate protests over the last year. Both movements speak to a mounting feeling of urgency, and an interest in organising to influence policy. While not all those who are engaged in climate activism will be old enough to vote, two cohorts of that active, politically savvy school-strike generation will have entered the voting bracket since 2017. They will undoubtedly see this election as a means to tackle the climate emergency. The avalanche of youth interest was also accelerated by a collaborative public drive to get young people to register. Celebrity intervention feels as if it has gradually become a mainstay in our politics (which perhaps says something about who we trust) - Stormzy's social media posts resulted in a surge in traffic on the voter registration website. In other online efforts, Momentum says it persuaded more than 120,000 people to register with its grassroots-funded Facebook ads. Many have warned us not to get too excited too soon. After all, younger voters change address more frequently, and thus are disproportionately represented in new registration figures. And a chunk of those 3 million registrations will have already been on the books. Meanwhile, in terms of actual turnout, the 12 December date is a particularly dangerous obstacle for our demographic, as many university students will be departing for the holidays, and votes in student-dominated constituencies may be affected. But enough of the caveats. Many pundits have said that this is an uninspiring election, that voters are underwhelmed by the choices. But the rise in youth engagement suggests otherwise: that among the young there is palpable excitement about the potential for imaginative, radical change. If this registration surge is reflected in turnout, who knows what may happen? In the recent galvanising spirit of optimism that I found in the Labour manifesto, I see no shame in saying: there is hope. '¢ Micha Frazer-Carroll is opinions editor at gal-dem ",0,Neutral
NHS data is a goldmine. It must be saved from big tech,1.25,Positive,"As a society, we are finally acquiring a healthy scepticism about the use and abuse of our personal information. New polling conducted by YouGov for the Institute for Public Policy Research shows that 80% of the public want to see tighter rules applied to how the likes of Facebook and Amazon use their data. Over the weekend, it was revealed that US pharmaceutical companies have already been sold data relating to millions of NHS patients and that Amazon, incredibly, has been given free access to NHS data Hidden away in the secret US-UK trade papers, leaked and revealed by Labour in November, is perhaps the biggest single threat to public data yet seen. The potential threat to the NHS from a post-Brexit US trade deal is clear, and has become a major election talking point. But alongside the well-known dangers of accelerating privatisation and drug price hikes, there are risks to one of the UK's most prized publicly owned resources. The NHS has one of the planet's most valuable repositories of data: primary care records that cover sometimes decades of consistent, high-quality, trusted data on 55 million individuals, potentially covering their entire health histories. On top of that, an estimated 23 million care records document episodic treatments when patients receive secondary or specialist care. Accountants Ernst & Young estimate its value at £9.6bn annually. For pharmaceutical companies, such comprehensive data is considerably more valuable than any sample. Large, clean, consistent and trusted datasets such as the NHS's are a goldmine. Already, medical researchers are deriving useful results from machine-learning techniques - for instance, in providing rapid diagnoses of cataracts and other common eye diseases. And with progress in medical research increasingly driven by such techniques, the value of NHS data will only increase over time. It is a glistening prize for major health and pharmaceutical providers - or, indeed, big tech companies looking to move into the field. That is why, as the leaked documents say, 'obtaining commitments on the free flow of data is a top priority'for the US (you can find this on page 22). Free flows of data, including removing barriers to 'data localisation'ù, imply that very sensitive health data could be taken and placed on servers outside of UK domestic law. And as Alan Winters, director of the Trade Policy Observatory at Sussex University has explained, combined with the US insistence that copyright and patent law are strictly enforced under a future trade deal, this could mean a situation where the UK is unable to analyse its health data without paying a royalty to Silicon Valley to use an algorithm. Leaving the EU on the terms of the current withdrawal agreement - which imply a sharp break with the EU, including its various protections on data transfer - would leave the UK significantly weakened in any future trade deal with the US. We could be handing over an extraordinarily valuable public resource before we had really begun to appreciate its value. Some of the risks are already understood. In a widely publicised case, the Royal Free Hospital was found in breach of data protection law in November 2017 by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). Records of 1.6 million patients were handed over to Google's DeepMind to help create an app, Streams, intended to alert clinicians rapidly to potentially acute kidney injury. Following complaints, the ICO found that patients were not fully informed about how their data was being used, and requested that the Royal Free tighten up its own data protection procedures. But beyond privacy concerns, the value of the data should also concern us. We could be developing extraordinary new diagnostic tools or deriving new treatments, all from the NHS dataset. It holds a huge potential economic value. But if that value is simply captured by private concerns, it will be significantly lost to the rest of us. The current approach - of allowing free access to data, and strictly enforcing intellectual property on insights and techniques derived from it - needs to be turned on its head. Localisation of data - and therefore democratic control and data sovereignty - must always be treated as an option in trade deals, while the patenting and copyrighting of algorithms and data-derived insights (particularly when taken from public data sources) should be weakened. There is no robust relationship between the enforcement of intellectual property and innovation in AI research, but patents on AI are rising globally. Instead of the encroaching privatisation of publicly held data - taken, in this case, under our noses - we should be looking to create a 'digital commons'ù, putting the value to be derived from publicly held data into the hands of the public who created it. Two immediate needs arise. The first is to bar attempts to undermine data localisation in any post-Brexit trade deals - the 'free flow of data'should not be taken as inherent good. The second is to move to a less restrictive patent and copyright regime in artificial intelligence, both in any future trade deals and when enforcing existing national laws. The public is already clear on the privacy and security implications of the data economy. We need now also to think about how best to maximise and protect its public value.

"On the streets of a marginal seat, I've seen how remain disunity could seal Brexit",0.125,Positive,"Will you be voting for us?'asks the Liberal Democrat canvasser on the doorstep of an expensive-looking house in Putney. 'No,'replies the middle-aged man standing in the doorway, 'I'll be voting for democracy.'We all understand what he means: Conservative, to fulfil the promise of the 2016 referendum and not simply to revoke Brexit, as the Lib Dems propose to do. My father, who lived most of his life just up the road from here, might well have given the same answer. Putney, which at first glance looks like a very ordinary part of south-west London, is actually a cradle of English democracy. It was here, in the church of St Mary the Virgin, which still stands hard by the River Thames, that Oliver Cromwell's soldiers gathered for a revolutionary debate in 1647. There the Leveller Thomas Rainsborough advanced the foundational idea of modern democracy in these immortal words: 'I think that the poorest he that is in England hath a life to live as the greatest he, and '¶ every man that is to live under a government ought first by his own consent to put himself under that government.'Centuries later, the constituency of Putney could be a bellwether in the UK's latest, hugely consequential democratic choice. If Putney remains in Conservative hands, then Boris Johnson will probably secure a clear majority in parliament and take Britain out of the EU on 31 January. If it goes back to Labour, then there is still a chance of a multiparty parliamentary majority for a second referendum, in which the country could democratically choose to remain in the EU. My father might have agreed with the man on the expensive doorstep but I emphatically don't. As the leading Brexiteer David Davis once put it, if a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy. To achieve that result will require skilful tactical voting on a large scale, here as in other marginal constituencies. In the 2016 referendum, Putney voted 72% for remain. Its Victorian terraced houses, comfortable Edwardian semis and more modern mansions are full of Tory remainers. The local electoral history and recent in-depth polling by the campaigning organisation Best for Britain clearly indicate that, if Brexit is still the key issue for these Tory remainers, they need to hold their noses and vote Labour. So should the constituency's large minority of Liberal Democrats. Elsewhere, for example in the Oxford West and Abingdon constituency where I now live, Labour voters should return the compliment and vote Liberal Democrat. According to Best for Britain, adept tactical voting by fewer than 41,000 voters in 36 marginal constituencies could prevent a Conservative parliamentary majority. There is now a large degree of consensus between the different tactical voting advice sites. Everyone who believes this election is our last chance to stop Brexit should simply follow that advice, whatever you think of the favoured party or candidate. Having grown up in the urban village of Roehampton, which is part of the Putney constituency, I find it a curiously moving experience to be back, observing political canvassing amid the characteristic greeny-yellowy-grey brick terraced houses and ornate Victorian pubs. My parents moved here because my mother's uncle was the local Conservative MP. Uncle Hugh, as we knew him, was elected in a byelection in 1942 and held the seat until 1964, when the tower blocks of the large new council estate built in Roehampton swung it to Labour. It has gone to and fro between Tory and Labour ever since, most recently being held by the popular Justine Greening, one of the pro-European Tories to be stripped of the Conservative whip by Johnson, and as a result now retired from politics. (If the Conservative leadership had kept her in a broad church party, she would surely have held this seat for them.) When I was a child, my staunchly Conservative father would sometimes take me with him when canvassing for the Tories in those tower blocks. I will never forget peering up from the height of Dad's thigh to see the same scene repeated all the way from the first to the 10th floor: council flat door opens, man or woman with cigarette looms above me and gives my father some more or less polite variant of 'I'm not voting for you, mate.'Now I'm standing at some of those same doors, in those same blocks: nothing has changed and everything has changed. My rain-drenched return to Putney leaves me depressed and heartened in equal measure. Depressed because here, as elsewhere, the disastrous disunity in the pro-European camp could hand victory to Johnson and the Brexiteers. The People's Vote campaign, which magnificently brought a million people to demonstrate on the streets of London, has collapsed in internecine feuding. Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates are not stepping down to help each other where they clearly should. The yellow wave of liberal revival has not materialised, partly due to two major blunders by rookie Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson: proposing to revoke article 50 without a second referendum (democratically illegitimate in principle, tactically foolish in practice); and placing herself front and centre of the campaign as (pull the other one!) our next prime minister. With both Labour and Liberal Democrats campaigning hard in Putney, a sophisticated YouGov poll currently predicts that they will split the opposition vote, thus gifting a narrow victory to the Conservatives. With Britain's unfair first-past-the-post system, all the dedicated efforts of the Lib Dem and Labour canvassers I watched pounding those rainy pavements would then count for nothing. I'm also depressed by the fact that these tower blocks are exactly as I remember them, only much more run-down, while just a stone's throw away countless millions have been spent on doing up the private houses of the prosperous. 'The poorest he that is in England'couldn't afford even a broom cupboard in Putney these days. When I quote an online estimate that the average house price here is more than £500,000, several local people have the same response: 'Oh, that seems a little low to me.'Meanwhile, the food banks are called upon more than ever and the curate of St Mary's tells me, 'We had 35 homeless people sleeping in the church on Monday.'But I'm also heartened. Heartened because in the very place where the English reinvented democracy, democracy is alive and flourishing. I spoke to the three main candidates and found them all to be decent, civilised, serious people. Everywhere I went I saw little groups of canvassers busily going from door to door, typing their findings into their smartphones ('Would you call her soft Conservative?'ù). While the candidates have faced isolated incidents of abuse, for the most part the people of Putney uphold the best English traditions of robust civility. The voters on the doorstep were also impressively thoughtful, and many of them already display a laser focus on tactical voting. So this unlikely cradle of democracy might yet help keep England where it belongs: in Europe. '¢ Timothy Garton Ash is a Guardian columnist ",0.625,Positive
"Dear Labour leavers, if you're tempted to vote Tory, here are 10 reasons to think again",0.125,Positive,"Next week, when Britain goes to the polls, the crucial battlegrounds will be in the Midlands and the north of England, where traditional working-class Labour voters who support Brexit are being lured by Boris Johnson's pledge to 'Get Brexit done'ù. Many are considering voting Tory for the first time. As someone raised in a northern working-class town and whose dad was white and working-class, I understand the frustrations that led to Brexit (if my dad was still alive he may well have voted leave), and why so many people want the referendum result to be swiftly enforced. Over the past few weeks I've read a lot of articles where remainers talk to remainers and leavers to leavers. So let me reach out, respectfully, from a remainer to a leaver, and ask that you think twice about casting your vote for the Conservatives. 1. 'Get Brexit done'ù. Really? It's a comforting thought that, after this Christmas election, Britain will have left the European Union within weeks. But what kind of nation will we be after that? Division will run deep in our society, with the 48% (16 million) remain voters believing the Boris Johnson Brexit is very different to that promised back in 2016: out of the single market, out of the customs union, and a border down the Irish sea. None of this was on the side of the bus. And that's not even to mention the fact the Brexit isn't even 'done'till a trade agreement is reached, which will likely take years. No deal could well be back on the table in a year's time. 2. Brexit is for life '¶ Yes, the years of negotiation have been agonising. But there are two main reasons for this: first, Theresa May drew up contradictory red lines that required a hard border in Ireland. And second, leaving the EU after more than 40 years was always going to be a complex process. Think of it like buying a home: if the property survey shows up unforeseen problems, the answer is to resolve them first, rather than press ahead for a move on an arbitrary date regardless of the consequences. From chlorinated chicken to medical supplies, to ferry companies with no ships, there has been no shortage of unforeseen problems. It's not surprising there have been delays. Though a swift end seems appealing, remember: Brexit is for life, not just for Christmas. 3. The Tories have a record for cheap slogans. Only two years ago Theresa May went into the election saying: 'I'll deliver Brexit.'How did that go? Before that, David Cameron pledged to eradicate the deficit and to slash immigration. Both targets are now scrapped. Johnson has said: 'We'll leave Europe on 31 October, no ifs or buts.'He said he'd rather 'die in a ditch'ù. Slogans are simple - reality is a lot more difficult. 4. Johnson despises people like you. In a Spectator article he wrote that working-class men are 'likely to be drunk, criminal, aimless, feckless and hopeless'ù. Johnson is not your friend, your ally, or someone who's looking out for you. In the same article he attacked single mothers and their 'ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate'children. When challenged, he says dismissively: 'I've written millions of words.'But those words had the clear aim of holding up the working-class and single mothers to ridicule and moral condemnation in a magazine catering for the rich and powerful. 5. Johnson picks on the weak. His attacks on black people ('watermelon smiles'ù, 'piccaninnies'ù), Muslims (niqab wearers look like 'letterboxes'and 'bankrobbers'ù) and gay people ('bumboys'ù) are now well known. Last week another quote emerged. 'Islamophobia - fear of Islam - seems a natural reaction,'he wrote, again in the Spectator. 'Judged purely on its scripture - to say nothing of what is preached in the mosques - it is the most viciously sectarian of all religions in its heartlessness towards unbelievers.'If there's one consistent theme to Johnson's writing, it's that he picks on the weak, those who don't have a media platform to answer back. 6. In contrast, Corbyn always fights for the underdog. While Johnson was smashing up restaurants with his Bullingdon mates knowing he'd never have to worry about the law, Jeremy Corbyn was campaigning to make life better for ordinary working people of all backgrounds. For a fair tax system in which the rich pay their share; against factory and pit closures; and against the sell-off of Britain's national assets. And he went further: he spoke out for the rights of black people and ethnic minorities facing discrimination and harassment; for women's rights; for gay rights; and for dialogue with Northern Ireland's republicans. All of these, at the time, were unpopular causes and were pilloried in the press as 'loony left'ù. Yet all, today, are accepted as mainstream - some even lauded as a sign of 'British values'ù. 7. Labour and antisemitism. Corbyn's critics are right to say the party should have handled its complaints better and faster. But paradoxically, what's given antisemitism such a high media profile over the past couple of years (compared to Tory party Islamophobia, which is widespread but barely receives any coverage), is that fact that Labour members care so much about it and will not stop until it is driven out of the party. 8. How to unite the country. If Britain is to leave Europe then let it at least be done in a way the nation can unite behind. We now know far more about what it really means than we did in June 2016. If it really is still the will of the people, there should be no problem in getting another majority for it. But this time, it would be on the basis of a clear outcome that has been negotiated in advance. A Corbyn-negotiated Brexit (the basics of which have already, in principle, been met warmly by EU leaders) would protect jobs, protect trade, and protect workers' rights. Johnson's deal does none of those things. Remainers would still regret a vote for Brexit, but would abide by it and move on. The Tories call this 'dithering'ù. Yet they've bungled Brexit for three and a half years, and we've still not left the EU. Corbyn could resolve this Tory-created crisis within six months. 9. Remember why you've always voted Labour. If Britain leaves with Johnson's deal on 31 January there'll certainly be a strong sense of relief. But it will be short-lived. Because then we'll face five more years of Conservative government, and let's not forget what that means: more cuts (the Tories say they'll protect the NHS and the police but almost everything else will likely be slashed back); more job insecurity; more homelessness; more demand for foodbanks; fewer local services; no plan for social care; tax cuts for the richest; and no investment in the green economy of the future. If Johnson's elected, we'll be back in a harsh, Tory Britain. Don't forget what that feels like. 10. A question of character. Who do you trust? One of the candidates for prime minister has a decades-long track record of campaigning for those the powerful don't care about: working people, sick and disabled people, minorities, and the weakest and most marginalised. The other has a decades-long record of looking out for himself, vilifying the vulnerable, lying and cheating. He won't even say how many kids he has. If you think the second of these is the man who can unite Britain and lead us into a brighter future then, once more, I respectfully urge you: please think again.

"British diplomat in US resigns, saying she can't 'peddle half-truths' on Brexit",0,Neutral,"The British diplomat in charge of explaining Brexit to the US government, Congress and public, has resigned, saying she was no longer prepared to 'peddle half-truths on behalf of a government I do not trust'ù. Alexandra Hall Hall, the Brexit counsellor at the UK embassy in Washington, had been frustrated with the job for some time, according to friends and colleagues. They said she felt she was not being given enough reliable information to do her job, which was to explain Britain's departure from the EU to US audiences and help promote a strong US-UK relationship post-Brexit. Her resignation, which was addressed to the chargÈ d'affaires, Michael Tatham, and circulated among close colleagues at the embassy, was damning in its description of the Johnson government's integrity. 'I have been increasingly dismayed by the way in which our political leaders have tried to deliver Brexit, with reluctance to address honestly, even with our own citizens, the challenges and trade-offs which Brexit involves; the use of misleading or disingenuous arguments about the implications of the various options before us; and some behaviour towards our institutions, which, were it happening in another country, we would almost certainly as diplomats have received instructions to register our concern,'Hall Hall wrote in the letter, dated 3 December. The letter was published by CNN, and its authenticity was confirmed to the Guardian by diplomatic sources. 'It makes our job to promote democracy and the rule of law that much harder, if we are not seen to be upholding these core values at home,'Hall Hall said. 'I am also at a stage in life where I would prefer to do something more rewarding with my time, than peddle half-truths on behalf of a government I do not trust.'Hall Hall has 33 years of experience as a diplomat. She was the UK's ambassador to Georgia for three years until 2016, and was head of the Foreign Office human rights department. She also served in Bangkok, New Delhi and Bogot√°. She was seconded to the US state department from 2002 to 2004, working on promotion of human rights and democracy in the Middle East. She was still working at the embassy on Friday, but is due to leave in the week before Christmas. She is married to the American head of the International Republican Institute, Daniel Twining. 'She was really good at her job and really well respected around town,'said a source who had frequent dealings with Hall Hall over Brexit and its consequences. 'She has done everything right, and has had legitimate concerns. This is not something that has just developed in the past week or two. It dates back, but I had the impression her concerns were being dealt with internally. I am surprised it has come to this.'A foreign office spokesperson said: 'We don't comment on the detail of an individual's resignation.'After her posting in Tbilisi, Hall Hall had taken a break from government, moving to Washington to become a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, where her writing focused on the need for western solidarity in the face of Vladimir Putin's expansionism. But last year, she took the Brexit counsellor job at the embassy. 'She was a Remainer, but she told me that at the end of the day she supported her country and her government and she saw the role as crucial to making a success of the transition,'a former colleague recalled. Daniel Fried, a former US assistant secretary of state for Europe, said: 'Ambassador Hall Hall is known to her US colleagues, myself included, as a person of integrity and insight. I cannot comment on the specifics of her charges, but she is a credible and serious person and as such her words carry weight.'Nile Gardiner, director for the Margaret Thatcher Centre for Freedom at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, said: 'It is very, very disappointing to see a British diplomat not implementing the official policy of their government.''Diplomats should not be giving their own interpretation of information provided by their own government,'Gardiner added. The UK embassy has been without an ambassador since July, when Kim Darroch resigned following the leak of internal foreign office cables in which he described the Trump administration as dysfunctional, faction-riven and inept. The nomination of a successor has been delayed by political turmoil in Britain. ",0,Neutral
John Major backs three ex-Tory independents in election campaign,0.75,Positive," The former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major has thrown his weight behind rebel ex-Tories who are standing as independents in next week's general election. Speaking at a rally on Friday evening, Major will say that given the opportunity he would cast his vote for Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general who was a thorn in the side of Theresa May's government. A serial rebel on Brexit legislation, Grieve was a leading figure in the cross-party group that helped force the Conservatives to offer MPs a meaningful vote on the withdrawal agreement. He was stripped of the Conservative whip by Boris Johnson, making him ineligible to stand again as a Tory candidate, but he is standing in Beaconsfield as an independent against his former party. Major also said he would support two other former Conservative ministers who are running as independents - the former justice secretary David Gauke and the former business minister Anne Milton. Major is expected to say: 'Let me make one thing absolutely clear: none of them has left the Conservative party, the Conservative party has left them. Without such talent on its benches, parliament will be the poorer, which is why - if I were resident in any one of their constituencies - they would have my vote.'Major's intervention underlines the radical transformation Brexit has unleashed in the Conservative party, and in particular since Johnson took over as prime minister in July. A string of well-known Tory moderates, including Amber Rudd, Nicky Morgan and Philip Hammond, opted not to stand again, while Johnson has boasted that every Conservative candidate has signed up to his Brexit deal. Gauke is running in South West Hertfordshire. He has spoken out repeatedly about Johnson's approach to Brexit, and what he has called the prime minister's 'Farage-lite'strategy. Milton is standing in her old seat of Guildford. Major will describe Brexit as the 'worst foreign policy decision in my lifetime'ù, and say that leaving the EU will affect 'nearly every single aspect of our lives for many decades to come'ù. 'It will make our country poorer and weaker. It will hurt most those who have least. Never have the stakes been higher, especially for the young. Brexit may even break up our historic United Kingdom,'he will say. Major will urge voters: 'Don't wake up on Friday 13 December and regret not making a choice.' He will be joined at the rally in central London by the former Labour prime minister Tony Blair. The event has been organised by two anti-Brexit campaign groups, Vote for a Final Say and For Our Future's Sake. Blair will warn voters not to give the Tories a majority on 12 December. He is expected to say: 'This Conservative party, which now expels the likes of Michael Heseltine, disowns the statesmanship of John Major, a party whose chancellor as of July this year is now exiled in the wilderness for the temerity to say what he knows to be true, namely that a no-deal Brexit is a risk no responsible government would take; such a Conservative party does not deserve to govern unchecked and the country would not be wise to let them.'Vote for a Final Say is the campaign that has emerged from the acrimonious split in the People's Vote organisation. It is offering financial support to anti-Brexit candidates in the run-up to next week's poll. ",0.5,Positive
Farage hits out at three MEPs who quit Brexit party to back Tories,0,Neutral,"An embattled Nigel Farage has hit out at the three MEPs who dramatically abandoned his Brexit party just seven days before polling day. Annunziata Rees-Mogg - sister of the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg - Lance Forman and Lucy Harris all resigned the whip to back Boris Johnson's Brexit deal on Thursday. Farage, whose party is languishing at just 3% in the polls, used a BBC interview with Andrew Neil to dismiss Rees-Mogg's claim that the leave vote was being split across the country. He said: 'She doesn't understand what is happening in the Labour seats in which we are standing.'He said the Brexit party was up 17 points in the Labour marginal Great Grimsby, according to a new poll, while Labour was down 18 points with no shift in the Conservative vote. He said: 'In Grimsby the Conservatives, because of what we've done, will probably win.'He countered by arguing it was the Tories, by contesting constituencies such as Doncaster, Barnsley and Hartlepool, where he said voters were 'unlikely'to go blue, that were guilty of splitting the leave vote. During the Neil interview it was also put to Farage that three candidates had been found to have made anti-Muslim comments, including one calling Islam a 'child rapist death cult'ù. Farage insisted if 'idiots had slipped through the net'they would be sacked. Neil pointed out at that all of their names were still on election ballot papers. The news that the MEPs were quitting the party will be a blow to Farage, whose poor poll showing comes despite winning the largest number of seats in the European elections. It also follows the decision on Wednesday to sack the MEP John Longworth, the former director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, for 'repeatedly undermining'Farage's election strategy. At a press conference in Westminster on Thursday morning, the four MEPs said they were leaving because it had become clear their party was splitting the Brexit vote in key marginals and, as such, putting the campaign to leave the EU at risk. Rees-Mogg said: 'We need a strong leave-supporting government to deliver the Brexit 17.4 million voted for. The Conservatives are the only option for Brexit supporters and democrats alike.' Unhappiness among the MEPs started to emerge on Wednesday when Longworth, the chair of the Leave Means Leave campaign group, lost the whip for 'disloyalty'to the party. He was at odds with the party over election strategy, suggesting it should go after 20-30 carefully selected seats and not stand in 274 Labour ones. Earlier in the campaign Farage had decided to withdraw from 317 Tory-held seats to avoid splitting the vote. He said he had not been given credit by the four MEPs for this decision to try to help the Tories. Farage said: 'The only vote on the leave side that is currently being split is in areas such as Barnsley, the south Wales valleys, Doncaster and Hartlepool, where there is a risk that the Tories will split our vote.'ùA spokesman for the Brexit party said three of the MEPs already had strong links to the Tories, while Longworth had suddenly come round to Johnson's Brexit plans despite being a long-time advocate of leaving the EU on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms. He suggested the Tories might reward Longworth at a later date for his backing. The spokesman said: 'We also note that one of the MEPs is the sister of a cabinet minister, another has a partner who works in the office of the same cabinet minister and yet another is a personal friend of both Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. 'In the case of John Longworth, who was for years the firmest advocate of WTO withdrawal that we have ever met, he underwent a metamorphosis into being a supporter of the new EU treaty following two days of meetings in London. We hope that Mr Longworth is well rewarded for his actions.'A Brexit party spokesman turned up to a press conference organised by the four MEPs and spoke to journalists outside. He said the Conservatives had been seeking to bribe Brexit party candidates to stand down for weeks and suggested that was what had happened in the case of the four MEPs. However, the MEPs said they had not had contact with the Conservative party. 'The first [the Conservatives] heard about it, was when [the media] heard about it,'said Forman. Rees-Mogg said she found it 'disturbingly old-fashioned'that people were suggesting her brother was able to dictate her political views. 'He doesn't,'she said. 'We have completely independent views of each other. I am only concerned about Brexit.'She later said: 'It is clear to me that the Brexit party is splitting the vote of leavers in marginal and not-so-marginal constituencies. If you look at the likes of Lincoln, of Gedling, of Sedgefield, of Hartlepool, of High Peak, Weaver Vale, Gower, Bolton East, the list goes on and on. 'In Scotland, Wales and England the Brexit party are permitting votes to go away from the Conservatives, providing us with a remain coalition that will do anything not to honour the Brexit referendum.'

Data shows 90% of EU settlement scheme appeals successful,0.75,Positive,"Nine in 10 appeals brought by EU citizens who have challenged Home Office decisions about their right to stay in the UK post-Brexit have been successful, new data has revealed. The Public Law Project (PLP), which obtained the figures, said the findings raised 'a number of red flags'for EU citizens 'seeking to make the UK their home'ù. The PLP discovered via a series of freedom of information requests that 89.5% of initial EU settlement scheme (EUSS) decisions subject to an 'administrative review'by an EU citizen unhappy with their conclusions were overturned. In just under 60% of total reviews, the Home Office refunded the £80 administration fee. The FoI shows that 451 administrative reviews had been requested up to 12 September this year, less than six months after the scheme was launched. Of the total 325 administrative reviews that had been decided by that date, 291 resulted in a decision of 'pre-settled status'being overturned and 'settled status'granted. The PLP says this success rate is 'drastically higher'than other Home Office administrative reviews, which were recorded in 2016/2017 as 3.4%. Most, but not all, of the 3.4 million EU citizens who wish to remain in the UK after Brexit must apply to the scheme. Those who have been in the country for fewer than five years can get pre-settled status allowing them to remain lawfully in the country. Under the system, 'administrative reviews'may be requested if a decision grants pre-settled status but an applicant believes they qualify for settled status. Some decisions have been overturned because of mistakes made by caseworkers, although the Home Office says the majority are made because an applicant has provided new information. The PLP says the data could show a successful process in operation, demonstrating the Home Office checks are working. Bu it 'could also indicate that the automated data checks and initial decision-makers are getting things wrong more frequently,'said PLP research director Joe Tomlinson and PLP researcher Alice Welsh in a blog post on the matter. It is also a concern because 'a tribunal appeal right for EUSS decisions is still yet to be legislated for and judicial review is expensive, inaccessible, and limited to narrow legality claims, so administrative review is the primary mode of redress'available for applicants to the scheme, they added. The Home Office said the overall number of administrative reviews 'is very low compared to the 2.4m applications and 1.9m granted status by the end of October 2019'ù. It also cautioned against concluding the high number of successes were because of mistakes by officials. It said the 'majority of overturned decisions are not caseworker error but where an applicant provides new information'ù. However the PLP said that whatever the reason, the Home Office needs to get every decision right and may have to improve its communications to ensure EU citizens apply with correct information. Tomlinson and other lawyers are warning EU citizens not to accept pre-settled status if they feel they are entitled to settled status and to challenge Home Office decisions. 'This distinction could have a big impact on their rights to access services in the UK such as healthcare, housing and benefits,'says Tomlinson. Last month it emerged that the proportion of EU citizens being granted 'pre-settled status'in the UK has continued to rise. Tomlinson called on the Home Office to provide greater detail about the data it provides to the public in order to help ensure independent observers are satisfied the system is not discriminatory or faulty. 'The lack of available data means it is impossible for anyone outside of the Home Office to trouble shoot. Is the system working well or not? We just don't know,'said Tomlinson. ",1,Positive
Labour needs to shine a light on Tory failures,0.25,Positive,"Well done, Andy Beckett, for trying to refocus electoral debate towards the record of the incumbent party of government (Our focus on the future lets Johnson avoid the present, Journal, 30 November). After almost 10 years of Britain having a Tory prime minister and a Tory-led government, everything in the public domain is worse: the NHS, education, housing, public transport, social care, policing, inequality, poverty and, most shaming of all, child poverty. Add to that their fouling of public discourse with the Brexit mess, which they have failed to clean up, and it is no wonder that Boris Johnson would wish to direct our gaze towards the sunlit uplands of the Tory-managed future and away from the past and present. While the Lib Dems might be shy about pointing the finger, given their complicity in the cruel failure of austerity, it is a mystery why the Labour party is not more vocal on the Tory record. The independent media, meanwhile, have an absolute duty not to neglect this important element of the pre-election debate.Keith HowellsMorpeth, Northumberland '¢ Andy Beckett's thoughtful critique of the Labour campaign argues that it concentrates too much on the future and not enough on Conservative responsibility for 'the dire state of much of Britain now'ù. True. But this is not the only problem with the campaign. In the north of England, where the Liberal Democrats are hardly in contention, many voters are trying to decide whether to remain loyal to Labour or to believe propaganda delivered by a Conservative-supporting tabloid press. Abstract campaign slogans such as 'The many, not the few'are unlikely to help them make up their minds. Such slogans may accurately reflect the party's underlying ideology, but what emotions do they engage? Mild envy? The focus must be on concrete messages that draw attention to present problems, appeal to traditional loyalty to the party, and engage emotions likely to influence voting (anger, fear, anxiety, need for security). Something like 'Stop life getting worse. Stand by Labour. We care'would do the trick, and even fit on the side of a campaign bus.Nigel HarveySt Albans, Hertfordshire '¢ Andy Beckett argues persuasively that concentrating on the future rather than foregrounding the government's record has been helpful to the Conservatives in this election. But this neglects one key, if tacit, aspect of the Tories' pitch. It is that they are now under entirely new management and so cannot be held responsible for the present, or the past. They are helped in this by the increasingly presidential style of our politics, aided by some of the TV formats portraying a simple contest between the main party leaders. Labour and the other progressive parties need to demonstrate the falsity of the 'new broom'image by revealing how complicit the would-be rulers have been in the policies of the last nine years, and the turmoil they have produced.Dr Ron GlatterHemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire '¢ Reading Andy Beckett's call for Labour to put more emphasis on the Tories' lacklustre near-decade in government, I was reminded of a recent public meeting in Wimbledon, where Keir Starmer asked the audience to name anything good that the Tories had achieved since coming to power. My partner likes a challenge, so piped up: 'Gay marriage.'This was the only achievement anyone could come up with, and, as another audience member commented: 'That didn't cost them anything either.'Now that the parties' manifestos have been published, I can only conclude that, if the Tories do get in with a majority, the country has been so worn down by austerity that the best future its population can imagine is a nation continuing along the same dismal path, but free of Europe and without potholes.Tristan WoodLondon '¢ Andy Beckett rightly talks about the calamitous effects of years of Tory austerity - non-existent in media coverage of the election. Missing is any debate about the shameful poverty and hunger that are having terrible effects on children, families and communities. Silence from political parties except Labour, whose manifesto at least shows the moral leadership and sense of responsibility needed to address the causes of destitution.Julie OwensCarlisle, Cumbria '¢ Andy Beckett is right to draw attention to the fact that 'an election about the future can also make bad news from the present seem irrelevant'ù, but there really is a bigger tragedy than the Tory legacy and a Johnson government. Defeat for Labour will mean, inevitably, that whoever takes over from Jeremy Corbyn will return the Labour party to the so-called 'middle ground'of progressive politics. I have been waiting for more than 20 years for the Labour party's magnificent new manifesto - one that could herald a better society for us all. Its rejection will, I fear, destroy the prospects for real change for another generation. Only one person can really be held to blame for this dismal future. Jeremy Corbyn is a decent and honourable but vain man. The fact that he cannot see that he is the single most important (maybe only) barrier to Labour having the majority that would enable it to implement its manifesto is a disgrace, which will eventually shame us all. If only he would say, even now, that in the event of a Labour majority he will immediately allow the Labour party to elect a new leader, one to take the country forward in a real spirit of post-Brexit reconciliation. Please can the next leader of the Labour party be a more pragmatic idealist (and maintain the courage of 'It's time for real change'ù)?Frank NewhoferOxford '¢ Join the debate - email guardian.letters@theguardian.com '¢ Read more Guardian letters - click here to visit gu.com/letters '¢ Do you have a photo you'd like to share with Guardian readers?

Labour's 'òred wall' is looking shaky. But the problems started decades ago,0,Neutral,"Acombination of long-term cultural shifts and the fallout from the 2016 referendum have disrupted the electoral map in this general election, and two kinds of English places stick out. In one group - exemplifed by such recent Labour wins as Canterbury and Kensington, and talk of the Tories losing some Home Counties suburbs - are the kind of constituencies where a broadly liberal, educated element is repulsed by the Conservatives' reinvention as an anti-European, decidedly nasty party. Meanwhile, politicos are newly obsessed with the second: a very different swath of seats that are post-industrial and less affluent, where a majority of people voted leave and politics seems to be in a fascinating state of flux. This 'red wall'includes, to quote from the Mail on Sunday, 'the constituencies in the Midlands and the north which have historically voted Labour, but are swinging towards the Tories because of Mr Corbyn's opaque Brexit policy'ù. Our exit from the EU - or, rather, the fact that it has yet to happen - is certainly a big part of what is afoot. But if Labour shows signs of weakness in these places, many of the reasons stretch back decades. In that sense, however people vote, the sudden arrival of these places at the heart of politics marks a welcome turn away from the vapid politics of 'aspiration'towards something altogether more vital and visceral. It also asks massive questions of the left about whom it wants to represent, and where its politics is going. Last week, I spent four days travelling from Wolverhampton to Darlington, via the old Nottinghamshire coalfields and the Lincolnshire town of Grimsby: all said to be areas where the Tories may well be in with a serious chance of winning. I spoke to a lot of people - older leavers, in the main - who talked about their affinity with Labour as something from the past, were bitterly dismissive of Jeremy Corbyn, and set on voting for Boris Johnson, even if their view of the Tory leader was often deeply sceptical. Equally, the stereotype of politically aware young people avidly consuming the election on their phones and determined to vote Labour is real, and often impressive. In between lay a varied array of voters, many of whom vividly conveyed why - notwithstanding Labour ticking up in the polls - the party seems to have no chance of convincingly beating such an awful government, with such a terrible record. I met people who work as teaching assistants and care workers, still uncertain whom to vote for, with a view of Labour characterised not by contempt but a puzzled sense of distance. Running through a great deal of what I heard was a point voiced time and again by all kinds of people: in the absence of Brexit being delivered, why should they trust politicians to do anything else? And then there are the even more profound political factors. Go to such cities as Manchester and Plymouth, and you instantly get a sense that Labour has renewed its identity, and reaped the rewards. In too many other places, by contrast, there is often a sense of historically complacent party establishments, and failures frozen into the architecture: the Soviet-esque office block nudging the Victorian terrace, the grim multi-storey car park. Everywhere I go, there is no end of social innovation happening, usually in the form of grassroots initiatives that prove that some communitarian, compassionate ideals run as deep in the old Labour heartlands as they ever did. But politics too often seems irrelevant. In Grimsby, I spent time at Centre4, which offers everything from financial help for new small businesses, through support for people experiencing loneliness, to a gym. Its volunteers - women, for the most part - talked about the election as an extraneous event that didn't much interest them. If what we are facing is a deepening estrangement between progressive politics and the people and places it once spoke to as a matter of instinct, even more difficult arguments rear their heads. If you see a certain kind of old, white, working-class man and think that progressive politics ought to have nothing to do with him, you should maybe understand that your opinion is an indication of huge political failure. We also need to understand that the young person talking passionately about Corbyn and embracing his brand of social justice does not represent an entire generation. At a shopping parade in the Wolverhampton neighbourhood of Penn I met two sparky, loquacious twentysomethings whose jobs pay less than £9 an hour: he a duty manager at a town-centre hotel, she a care assistant. When I asked them whether they had thought of joining a trade union, they bluntly told me they did not know what that term meant. Neither did they have any sense of what the Labour party stands for. After talking to them, I sat in the car and listened to Len McCluskey imploring the party's lost voters to 'come home'ù. What does that even mean any more? The same, it pains me to say, applies to all the lingering noise about the Brexit referendum somehow being overturned and the need for a second vote. I am a passionate remainer. Instinctively, the prospect of binning the Brexit result lifts my spirits; since 2016, one of the most frustrating aspects of British politics has been Labour's refusal to talk meaningfully about our exit from the EU and the Tory fantasies that have propelled it. But at the same time, much more difficult thoughts are inescapable. Once a culture of industry, trade unionism and reflex Labour-voting had started to wane, people in post-industrial England felt increasingly cut off from politics. Whatever its inbuilt mendacities, the referendum was presented as a clear, era-defining choice; and whatever their motivations, people voted in good faith. Which brings me to my own tortured ambivalence, and a conclusion that has been rattling around my head since I got back from the red wall trip: unless millions of voters' exasperation with what has happened since 2016 is convincingly answered, and some kind of Brexit takes place, the chances of any firm reconnection between progressive politics and its supposed ancient heartlands look slim. That, undeniably, is one of the key reasons why a party led by an Eton-educated chancer is forecast to perform strongly in seemingly unlikely places - and why, even if Labour holds on in these seats, it has no end of work to do. If your response to that is a mixture of horror and bafflement, do not blame the voters. Think about your own side, from the Corbyn-supporting left to the liberal remain hardcore, and absences and estrangements out in the country that still seem a long way from receiving any kind of convincing answers.

Vince Cable calls Lib Dems' pledge to revoke article 50 'a distraction',-0.875,Negative,"Former Lib Dem leader Vince Cable has called the party's policy to scrap Brexit without another referendum 'a distraction and not a very helpful one'ù. After Jo Swinson replaced Cable in July, the party adopted the policy to support revoking article 50 and cancel Brexit without a second referendum, were the party to be elected into office. During a BBC Question Time leaders' special last week, Swinson was forced to defend her party's position. 'I don't think you could accuse us of not being upfront about wanting to stop Brexit,'she said. However, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday, Cable said the focus should have been on a second referendum instead. He added: 'I've always argued that actually it was wildly improbable. We were never going to get 350 MPs, so the policy had been and should be to argue for the People's Vote, going back to the public, to the referendum with support for remain. Under the first-past-the-post voting system, tactical voting is when you vote for a party that you would not normally support in order to stop another party from winning. For example, in a constituency where the result is usually tight between a party you dislike and a party you somewhat dislike, and the party you support usually comes a distant third and has no chance of winning, you might choose to lend your vote to the party you somewhat dislike. This avoids 'ò'wasting'your vote on a party that cannot win the seat, and boosting the chances that the party you dislike most will lose. 'So the revoke was a distraction and not a very helpful one.'In September, Sir Norman Lamb, a former Lib Dem health minister who is standing down as an MP, said the policy was 'playing with fire'ù. 'I don't feel personally that there are enough people out there trying to find ways to reunite our country,'he told the Today programme. 'I think that the polarisation that we are seeing is incredibly dangerous. I think we are playing with fire in many ways.'Since the start of the general election campaign, the Lib Dems have been squeezed in the polls, with Swinson's popularity figures also declining. Last week, Cable said there was a only a 'one in a million'chance that Jeremy Corbyn would become prime minister as he predicted there will be a hung parliament, a referendum and another general election. He also criticised the parties' promises to spend 'more and more and more'ù, describing the spending pledges as 'real Father Christmas stuff'ù. ",-0.5,Negative
"This election will be all about identity, not money. And the Tories know it",0,Neutral,"Why would anyone not vote Labour? If person A knocks on your door and offers you £1,000, no questions asked, and person B offers £100, why refuse A? The question has long puzzled experts. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn has pledged a great deal more in public spending than the (relatively) parsimonious Tories. Yet the Tories are running at 11 points ahead in the polls and appear within reach of victory. They have come first in seven of the last 10 elections, and according to at least one poll now hold a majority over Labour even among working-class voters.  In the early days of mass democracy it was thought populist politicians would bankrupt nations by promising to borrow and splurge ever more of 'other people's money'ù. Then the opposite theory held sway, that as the poor got richer they would vote Conservative. By the 1960s, Mark Abrams and Richard Rose famously asked Must Labour Lose? The answer was yes, unless the party changed. Under Harold Wilson and Tony Blair, Labour largely aped the Tories and won elections. It reassured the wavering centre of its un-radicalism. But the conservative undercurrent soon dragged voters back to the right, a tendency recently exacerbated by the titanic struggle over Brexit. It has left political analysts largely baffled. The clearest answer came from the US academic Jonathan Haidt, in an attempt to understand why on earth poor people voted for George W Bush. Why would they want a wider wealth gap, worse healthcare and more corporate greed? Haidt's answer was that these 'left behinds'saw politics as about more than money. It was about their families and collective safety, about local and group identity, about faith and a morality seen as personal, not ordained by the state. Yes, they cared about other people and fairness, but they also cared about themselves. Haidt's thesis was deeply troubling for Democrats - as it should be for Labour in Britain. Analysis by Matthew Goodwin and Roger Eatwell into who voted for Brexit in Britain and Donald Trump in the US found the tribes remarkably similar, with support in both cases more widely spread across ages and classes than initially supposed. Indeed, average leave and Trump voters had above-average incomes. What they shared was a concern about the continuity of their identity and way of life. They feared outsiders and newcomers. Brexit was cheered as much in struggling ex-industrial towns as in affluent Conservative counties. Most explanations have suffered from a failure to separate liberal contempt from dispassionate analysis. The decline of party politics in favour of group identity is often attributed - at least by Londoners - to issues of ethnicity and religion. Provincial Britain sees it differently. Its group identity is that of neighbourhood and town, assailed by outsiders of all sorts, with children seduced by bright lights, and replaced with migrants and interminable executive estates. As the political scientist Eric Kaufmann points out, income and social background are having ever less bearing on voting behaviour: 'Small-c conservative working-class voters have migrated to the Conservative party because of immigration and Brexit. On the other side, successful educated cosmopolitans opt for Labour or the Lib Dems.'This is most vividly seen in the correlation between remain voting and higher education. This is not a matter of economics, he says, but 'a measure of psychological openness and a liberal worldview'ù.  What may be deplorable must not become incomprehensible. I find leave voters resent what they see as their natural concern for the integrity of their community - or even the sovereignty of the British state - being dismissed as xenophobic or racist. When instructed to 'change or die'ù, they reply that we are all dead one day. Yes, a dynamic economy must be open to change - including economic migration - but only if the beneficiaries can persuade the sufferers that it is in their interest. Either way, it will depend on trust. Nothing so destroyed faith in David Cameron's government as its disregard of localism in planning and public services. People who do not trust those ordering them to change will seek revenge - even if it costs them money.  Brexit was, of course, change - but to some voters it was an imagined reversion to a more familiar past. It must be the most truly conservative vote in modern British history. It is why Boris Johnson was wise to stick with it, though unwise now to tear up treaty trading relations with the EU. It is also why Corbyn's reversion to the Labour party of the 1940s - to a land of nationalisation, council estates and workers' rights - may be shrewdly conservative rather than plain daft. It should reassure old Labour, like Tories preaching a return to empire. I have always thought it dangerous for liberals to assume that conservatives know in their hearts that conservative values are selfish and shallow. Humans are by their nature conservative. The new populism gets this, that politics is no longer 'the economy, stupid'ù. It is about things people find more important than money. Those who condemn Brexit fail to see it was never really to do with the EU, any more than it concerned the gross national product. It was about how far Britons can define and protect the character of where they live. Just now, the Conservative instinct understands this. So, in his Brexit hesitancy, does Corbyn. With Brexit over, it will be liberals who have a mountain to climb. '¢ Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist ",0,Neutral
Health unions seek assurances after leak on trade talks and NHS,0.5,Positive,"Medics have called for guarantees that health will not be put at risk for profit after Labour released official documents that it said proved the NHS would be 'on the table'in trade talks with the US. The leaked papers revealed that UK and US officials have repeatedly discussed dismantling protections that keep NHS drug prices down, undermining Boris Johnson's claim that healthcare is not on the table in trade talks.  Unions representing NHS staff said the disclosures were deeply worrying and rendered promises given previously by the Tories insufficient. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chair of the British Medical Association council, said: 'The implication that the NHS could be included in a post-Brexit trade deal with the US is alarming and must not become a reality. Despite previous assurances from Mr Johnson, following the release of these documents we now need cast-iron guarantees from all parties that the health service will form no part of negotiations around future trade deals, and that the health of the British public will not be put at risk by commercial motives or lower standards. 'We must ensure that no matter what government is in charge, patients' access to essential and life-changing medicine cannot be put at risk.'Donna Kinnair, the chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: 'Nursing staff will be very concerned at any suggestion or evidence that a post-Brexit trade deal with the US could mean open season on NHS services. No matter how people voted in the EU referendum, no one wants the health service to be exposed to a carve-up to facilitate trade negotiations with another country.'The NHS Confederation, which represents more than 560 organisations that plan, commission and provide NHS services, offered a more cautious response. The confederation includes the Independent Healthcare Providers Network, which counts among its members the UK arm of HCA Healthcare UK, part of the US-based company, which is one of the world's largest healthcare corporations. Layla McCay, its director of international relations, said: 'It will be for the government to decide what services to offer, or not, in any future trade deal. There might have been talks about NHS involvement in a potential US trade deal in the past but what is important is what the government actually commits to. At the moment it says that the NHS is not on the table.'NHS bosses have been accused of gagging staff during the election campaign to prevent them from highlighting the fragile state of the health service, which is a key battleground for Labour and the Conservatives, but some doctors publicly criticised Johnson. Dr Lauren Gavaghan, an NHS consultant psychiatrist, said: 'He [Johnson] lied to the public with the £350m NHS promise during the referendum and now we see US-UK trade deals include the NHS on the table. The NHS being opened up to American healthcare companies would be disastrous. 'We know that hundreds of thousands of people face huge financial strain and go bankrupt in the USA trying to pay medical bills. The public need to decide whether they want this in the UK and vote accordingly at the general election. I sincerely hope the NHS wins rather than Boris Johnson.'Ben White, a junior doctor, said: 'By now it's obvious to everyone the NHS, or parts of it, would be up for grabs as part of Boris's post-Brexit trade deal with the US. We cannot believe anything Boris says so must take the documents at face value. More analysis is needed to determine the full extent of the trade talks.'",0.5,Positive
Brexit? This election is about something much bigger than that,0.125,Positive,"I was five years old in 1997 when my mum took me with her to the polling station and let me scratch a wobbly X on the ballot paper. My main impression of the general election was it meant that I didn't have to go to school that day, and that voting Labour had something to do with Mum buying the biggest watermelon I'd ever seen from the Turkish shop on the way home. More opaque was why she cried the next morning, or phoned her sister just to repeat 'This is amazing '¶ it's just amazing'over and over. I think I understand her a bit better now. For a struggling single parent with two young kids, the end of 18 years of continuous Tory rule felt like being let out of a dark room. Today, we've come through nine more such years. We've seen Grenfell; the Windrush scandal; £5bn of cuts to disability benefits; 4 million children at risk of malnutrition owing to poverty; a parliament of landlords voting against a measure that would ensure all homes were fit for human habitation; rough sleepers in Westminster evicted after a complaint by the Commons chaplain about their 'ongoing stench'ù. The home secretary, Priti Patel, standing in a food bank, shifting the blame for growing poverty on to the local councils whose budget her government had cut. The last decade has seen our politicians turn into vandals, and a hatchet taken to the social contract. What we have witnessed is nothing less than, in the Italian theorist Franco Berardi's words, 'the slow cancellation of the future'ù. Austerity hasn't just decimated our public services. It has corroded the political imagination. The suggestion that the government might exist to improve people's lives rather than oversee the managed decline of our society is greeted as somehow preposterous. We're told the things that we had in the past would be unreasonable to have in the future. Politicians who got their university education for free tell the young that tuition fees are simply a fact of life. The return to corporation tax to about 2010 levels is regarded as akin to Maoism. And Boris Johnson, who has been otherwise careful to avoid the miserable determinism of Theresa May's 2017 campaign, fell back on the familiar bleat that there's no way to 'magic up'money for those who have borne the brunt of Conservative economic policy. Nowhere is our country's atrophied capacity to imagine better more apparent than in the political class's response to the climate emergency. Sure, Extinction Rebellion occasionally lurch into self-parody, but no amount of hippy-dippy nonsense could be more shameful than Adam Boulton's tirade on Sky News this year in which he accused climate activists of being 'the incompetent middle-class'and 'self-indulgent'ù. That a broadcaster rumoured to be paid £400,000 a year can get away with calling others moneyed and out of touch has permanently damaged the part of my brain responsible for processing irony. There's something fairly insane about a media culture that praises Michael Gove as an environmentalist hero for using a reusable cup while simultaneously delegitimising protest movements associated with climate justice. Aided and abetted by a supine media, the government has been allowed to miss a six-month deadline set by parliament to address the climate emergency. We are already on course to miss the dreadfully unambitious target set by May to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. And despite large swathes of South Yorkshire still being under floodwater, Brexit continues to be trotted out by broadcasters as the defining issue of this election.  There are problems with the Labour party. They have not committed to preserving freedom of movement in all circumstances; they have stuck with a prohibitionist approach to drugs; they have not stamped out antisemitism as ruthlessly as they ought to. But I will not let perfect be the enemy of hope. At its heart, the Jeremy Corbyn project represents the return of the future. In 1963, Harold Wilson promised that a 'new Britain'would be forged in 'the white heat of technology'ù. Now Labour vows that a green industrial revolution will bring in hundreds of thousands of jobs in renewable energy, green construction and transport infrastructure. How could we possibly afford to do all this? How could we possibly afford not to? What could be more urgent than securing a sustainable future on the only planet we have to live on? Somehow money always turned up when we needed to bail out the banks or pay for no-deal posturing, keep May in power with a bung for the DUP, or clean up after Chris Grayling. It gets harder to believe that 'there is no alternative'to economic misery when, quite clearly, there is when the Tories need it. What's at stake in this election? The future, and the possibility of its return. '¢ Ash Sarkar is a senior editor at Novara Media, and lectures in political theory at the Sandberg Instituut ",0.375,Positive
Labour to focus on Brexit-backing voters in final fortnight,0.125,Positive,"Jeremy Corbyn has attempted to play down Labour's general election strategy shake-up for the last two weeks of the campaign as the party pivots towards trying to save vulnerable heartlands in the north and Midlands. The Labour party leader insisted he would take the same anti-austerity message to all parts of the country at his 'plan for nature'launch in Southampton. Yet, behind the scenes, strategists are instigating a switch from going after Tory marginals to consolidating seats they already hold and trying to win back leave voters. The party suffered a bruising result in the YouGov MRP poll, which put Labour on just 211 seats, its lowest since 1983. 'Our campaign is in every part of the country. I am travelling all around the country. I say the same thing at every place I go. I don't have one message for one group,'Corbyn said, addressing questions that his campaign is about to change course. 'I say the same message everywhere. Vote Labour in order to get a government that will deal with the inequalities and poverty and injustice austerity has heaped on this country.'But the Guardian understands that after beginning the campaign with a resolutely offensive strategy, the party recognises that it now has much more to do to hold constituencies in Brexit-voting areas. It plans to hammer home the benefits of a pared-down set of its manifesto commitments that will put money directly in the pockets of voters in these constituencies. Labour strategists also say they will focus relentlessly on the risk of returning Boris Johnson to No 10 for five years, and seek to make the election a binary choice between Labour and the Tories in the hope of squeezing the Liberal Democrat vote further. Under the first-past-the-post voting system, tactical voting is when you vote for a party that you would not normally support in order to stop another party from winning. For example, in a constituency where the result is usually tight between a party you dislike and a party you somewhat dislike, and the party you support usually comes a distant third and has no chance of winning, you might choose to lend your vote to the party you somewhat dislike. This avoids 'ò'wasting'your vote on a party that cannot win the seat, and boosting the chances that the party you dislike most will lose. Even before Wednesday evening's YouGov projection, which gave Boris Johnson a 68-seat majority and predicted Labour would lose 44 seats, party strategists were concerned about the imperative of appealing to leave supporters. They point out that even in the 2017 general election, the six seats Labour lost were all in leave areas; and, even in those they held, the increase in Labour's vote share was significantly lower than elsewhere. The YouGov projection, which showed the Lib Dems failing to make inroads in many of the seats Labour is targeting, has strengthened the hand of those who have been making that argument internally. These include the 'four Ms'- Seumas Milne, Andrew Murray, Len McCluskey and Karie Murphy, Labour sources suggested. It was McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, who warned against expanding freedom of movement, as some Labour activists had hoped to. In traditional Labour heartlands the reaction among candidates to a new focus on their constituencies was mixed. Great Grimsby candidate Melanie Onn said she had not had a single visit arranged centrally to help her defend her 2,565-majority in her heavily leave-voting seat, so was surprised to hear about a shift in focus to the north of England and Midlands. 'I'll just have to wait and see what this refocus is, I'm not really sure what it means,'she said. The shadow health minister, Jon Ashworth, appears to be acting as a bridge between Corbyn, his shadow cabinet and those candidates in northern and Midland constituencies with a leave majority. As well as helping Onn launch her campaign he has also visited Stoke, which voted 72% leave, for a joint event in support of Labour candidates there.  Sonya Ward, who is trying to take back the traditional Labour heartland seat of Mansfield from Tory Ben Bradley, said she had been frequently visited by the shadow cabinet - including Corbyn. She said: 'I've been pretty well supported to be honest.'One Labour source in a heartland seat said: 'I think they have seen the polls, after ignoring the polls for a long time. Six months ago I started saying we were losing our vote. To be honest I think they've realised a little bit too late that they've been more interested in trying to save Emily Thornberry's seat in Islington than Labour heartlands.'Labour's Barry Sheerman, defending Huddersfield, which voted 51% leave in the referendum, said he would welcome more support for his colleagues in Yorkshire. While he has a healthy 12,000-majority, some female politicians elsewhere in the region risk losing their seats. The Tories are predicted to pick up three seats in South Yorkshire, including Don Valley, Penistone and Stocksbridge and Rother Valley, and four in West Yorkshire including Dewsbury, Keighley and Wakefield. He said: 'I think anything that targets any vulnerable seats where we have got absolutely first-class MPs - some of whom are the leading female MPs in parliament - is important, so any help that can be brought to them I would really welcome.'",0.5,Positive
US prefers no-deal Brexit according to documents obtained by Labour,0.125,Positive,"The US expressed a preference for a no-deal Brexit in meetings with UK officials, the Labour party has said. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, the Labour leader said that official documents from preparatory trade meetings between the UK and US revealed that the future of the NHS was at risk. The Conservative party accused Corbyn of indulging in conspiracy theories, with Boris Johnson giving 'a cast-iron'guarantee that the NHS would not be on the table in post-Brexit trade talks. As well as highlighting evidence that the US was keen to discuss the issue of drugs pricing and obtain 'full access'to UK markets, Corbyn pointed to a passage in one of the documents that said: 'there would be all to play for in a no-deal situation'ù. The document details a meeting on 10 and 11 July this year of the UK-US Trade and Investment Working Group, which was designed to lay the groundwork for a potential future trade agreement once the UK leaves the EU. It was held before Boris Johnson was elected as Conservative party leader and was forced to ask for an extension to the UK's EU membership at the end of October. 'UTTR [US trade representatives] were also clear that the UK-EU situation would be determinative: there would be all to play for in a no-deal situation but UK commitment to the customs union and single market would make a UK-US FTA [free trade agreement] a non-starter,'the document reads. 'We will play the sequencing of the next full working group by ear but have agreed a work programme for the next two months for coordination teams to take forward discussions on structure, sequencing and ways of working.'A Conservative party source said that it was simply fact that it would not be possible to do a free trade deal with the US if the UK remained in the single market and customs union. Corbyn said: 'What's at stake in a deal with Trump could not be more important for our country. In this election the Conservatives want you to vote blind, keeping millions of us in the dark about their plans.'The document also notes the pressure from 'political leadership'to ensure that both countries were prepared for negotiations to start as soon as the UK left the EU, with rounds of meetings every six weeks. 'He felt that being able to point to advanced negotiations with the UK was viewed as having political advantages for the president going in to the 2020 elections,'it said. ",0.375,Positive
"Brexit data firm broke Canadian privacy laws, watchdog finds",0,Neutral,"The Canadian data firm AggregateIQ (AIQ) broke privacy laws with some of the work it did for a leading pro-Brexit group in Britain and a number of US political campaigns, according to a watchdog's official report. Canada's federal privacy commissioner, Daniel Therrien, along with his counterpart in the province of British Columbia, said on Tuesday that AIQ had not taken measures to ensure it had the authority to disclose UK voter information. 'Canadian organizations operating globally... must ensure they understand and comply with their legal responsibilities in Canada, even when they are operating in foreign jurisdictions,'said Michael McEvoy, the British Columbia privacy tsar. AIQ was hired in 2016 by Vote Leave, which campaigned for Britain to leave the European Union, to draw up Facebook advertisements aimed at potential voters. AIQ, based in British Columbia, used data gathered online by Vote Leave, which it disclosed to Facebook. The privacy commissioners found Vote Leave had not explained to respondents that their information might be shared with Facebook, and AIQ did not do enough to make sure it had the right to use the information. The watchdog's report said: 'When the company used and disclosed the personal information of Vote Leave supporters to Facebook ... it went beyond the purposes for which Vote Leave had consent to use that information.'It added: 'When AIQ failed to ensure it had meaningful consent from the individuals whose personal information it collected, used, or disclosed, it contravened British Columbia and Canadian privacy laws.'AIQ Chief Operating Officer Jeff Silvester said in an email that the firm had already implemented all of the commissioners' recommendations. The report expressed similar concerns about lack of consent regarding some of the work AIQ had done on campaigns in the US for Strategic Communication Laboratories, the former name of the SCL Group, the parent company of the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Facebook came under pressure last year after revealing that the personal information of up to 87 million users, mostly in the US, may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica. In April, Therrien concluded in a separate investigation that Facebook committed serious contraventions of Canadian privacy law and failed to take responsibility for protecting the personal information of citizens.

My generation has benefited hugely from 'òpolitics'. We can't become apathetic now,-0.25,Negative,"I simply cannot be bothered with all this politics.'Our crumbly group is becoming increasingly grumbly of late and it's not surprising. Joyce's words summed up a collective tristesse generated by the Neverendum that has deteriorated into a sort of Brenda from Bristol mantra at the prospect of a general election, and has become commonplace among my generation - in the community centre, at the checkout and on the streets. The conduct of what should be the lodestar of parliamentary democracy will be a repeat of the same tired themes and immoderate memes that have dominated political discourse for the past three years and have led to the sort of civic fatigue betrayed by her outburst. I understand the sense of exhaustion; I feel it too, but it nevertheless scares the daylights out of me. It expresses a renunciation of responsibility, a cop-out that is probably a greater threat to democracy than any political ideology. Today's world is the outcome of yesterday's politics, and no generation has gained more advantage from 'politics'than ours. Our longevity can be traced directly to the political priorities that gave us access to health, education, care, housing, security, the social cloth that feather-bedded our lives and, in defiance of the Darwinian paradigm, continues to support our increasingly 'unfit'survival. Those priorities were and will continue to be the outcome of politics. And of course it is politics that will determine whether the planet on which our grandchildren will depend for food, air and water remains habitable. So, however toxic the conflict between the far left and ultra right, between remain and leave, their passions at least represent a political engagement without which society would be in a permanent state of anarchic chaos or political sclerosis. I have more respect for the arch Brexiter than I have for an apathetic crumbly who cannot be bothered with politics. What makes it worse is that this apathy has become respectable, even virtuous, the call to 'just get on with it'a statement of political machismo. It is the battle cry of the disengaged for whom impatience has become a virtue, presumably the same collective reflex that drives hordes of lemmings over precipices. There has been much talk of a divided country since the referendum, with political commentators and social geographers bandying statistics to support their various opinions. Of course statistics don't lie, only those who misuse them, but we crumblies were peculiarly vulnerable to the Brexodus project and its Moses and this will be reprised in the general election. The Tory party has always played the nostalgia card shamelessly, with hyped reminders of the sunlit uplands of our blue remembered hills while, as some social geographers claim, at the same time appealing to the psychological legacy of empire. The Brexit issue provided something new, a spirit of defiance that is seductive to my generation. Old age is a time of creeping concession, as our horizons narrow, our bodies decline, our energies fade. Yet our appetite to belong remains, to make a difference, to be taken notice of. So we are hungry for something, anything that will remind us of our technicolour years, that will put a swagger in our final steps before oblivion, a last hurrah in a life that has become taupe and tame. So 'do or die'is our very personal anthem, its binary option resonating with our existential reality. Brexit also triggers memories from our pre-adult years of those early icons of defiance like Just William and Dennis the Menace, standalone disruptors, lovable rogues, diamond geezers, quintessentially English. And in Boris we have the perfect talisman, a charismatic cross between TS Eliot's 'rough beast lurching'and Winston, hands in jacket pockets, shoulders thrusting forwards, a restless bullock about to charge as he barges up steps, through doors, past crowds. At once a funster and a thug, his increasing caricature of a Europe seeking to retain our service to an undemocratic project and his demand that this Pharaoh should 'let my people go'resonates with the geriatric sense of helplessness. Perhaps Joyce's disenchantment should be encouraged. After all, it could result in the abstention from the democratic process of the one generation that seems most likely to bring about a catastrophic result and least likely to suffer its consequences.

"In uncertain times, a museum of money is a sure-fire winner",0.125,Positive,"What Britain needs is another museum. No, really. Amid all the hand-wringing about whether Britain's economic destiny lies in or out of the European Union, there is a clear need for a place to visit that can help people discover how money works. A Brexit deal may have been passed and this election will be a distant memory whenever the museum opens its doors, but with financial education at such a low ebb, a centre that facilitates the discussion of modern-day market capitalism (and its alternatives) must be worth the relatively small outlay. It could be called a Money Museum or a Centre for Understanding Economics, but whatever its name, there is a value in such an institution and it's a value that other nations understand. In Paris, the French recently opened the CitÈ de l'√âconomie, or CitÈco. In 2018, Germany's central bank revamped the shiny glass and steel Money Museum that sits alongside its Frankfurt HQ. And there are several in the US. Almost 40 years of Thatcherite policymaking, which has dumped the responsibility for curating a secure financial future on the individual rather than the state, has left the country in need of a place that can help people figure out what is going on. And the need is more pressing now that we are in the midst of a climate emergency, and water-cooler conversations cover topics from international trade and customs unions to the rise of electronic currencies such as bitcoin. Many of Margaret Thatcher's disciples promised an increase in funding for financial education to put consumers on an even footing with the financial services industry. Unfortunately the sums have been pathetic. At the last count, the Money Advice Service said regulators, banks, and charities spent about £18m a year on educating the young about money. There is a money museum of sorts in the UK. Its entrance is tucked away up the side of the Bank of England's imposing headquarters in London's Square Mile. The Bank is currently considering ways of revamping the space with a view to giving it a more contemporary feel. At the moment, about 100,000 visitors a year tour the museum (entry is free) looking at assorted displays, mostly in cabinets, that tell the story of how the bank came into being and how it works now. This is not a place where the public can discover how companies account for their money, how the environmental effects of economic growth can be measured or how economic wellbeing is judged. By some accounts, the CitÈco in Paris, which is housed in a sumptuous neo-Renaissance palace, also qualifies as worthy but dull. Or at least not as exciting as it should be after the French spent £50m renovating the building and installing a range of interactive exhibits. It expects to attract 130,000 people a year even though it charges a hefty £12 entry fee for adults and £6 for school-age children. The gold-standard museum is the Interactive Museum of Economics (Mide) in Mexico City, where the central bank recruited sponsors from the finance industry to help transform an old central bank office into the most interactive and innovative museum of its kind. Billed as the world's first and only interactive economics museum, it has an annual budget of £2m and a staff of 110 (the Bank of England's employs a handful). In one room visitors can immerse themselves in a simulated trading floor, guided by virtual-reality headsets. At the entrance to another, marked Future of Money, visitors are handed a tablet computer to aid their discovery. A spokesman was keen to emphasise how farsighted the museum is. 'We always try to tie economics to nature,'he said, 'because economics starts in nature and ends in nature. In this way we try to relate everything in the museum to people as economic actors.'Entry is £4 for adults and £3 for students, but this hasn't deterred the 250,000 people who have visited every year since it opened almost 13 years ago. When both political parties are making huge spending promises, it would be relatively painless to set aside funds for an interactive museum. There are several science museums around the country; why not a proper economics museum?  Like Mexico's version, it should do more than just explain how the central bank works. Schools would then have access to a crucial resource: something that would promote discussion in times that are, Brexit or no Brexit, economically more uncertain than any we have seen since the second world war.

Shareholders back Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin at AGM,0,Neutral,"Shareholders have thrown their weight behind the founder and chairman of JD Wetherspoon despite a furious row over corporate governance. Ahead of Thursday's annual shareholder meeting, the influential proxy voting agencies that advise big shareholders how to vote had raised a number of red flags.  Tim Martin has been the executive chairman since 1983, in contravention of guidelines that recommend having a non-executive chairman operating above a chief executive. The advisory groups also criticised executive pay and Martin's use of company money to buy pro-Brexit beermats. In the end Martin received an overwhelming endorsement, with 98% of voting shareholders backing him. However, a fifth of independent shareholders voted against Debra van Gene and Sir Richard Beckett, who have been on the board since 2006 and 2009. Both executives, who have already agreed to step down, still polled 88% due to the support of Martin, who is the company's biggest shareholder. Despite the friction over the static line-up in the Wetherspoon boardroom, there was considerable love in the room for Martin at the meeting in the Square Mile.  A small army of mainly male pensioners threw their weight behind the outspoken Brexiter, quizzing him on the pub trade in a genial manner. One asked if the pub chain could stock small bottles of red wine to give his wife a bigger choice, while others confessed they found it difficult to book a stay in one of the company's hotels. In a dig at all-powerful institutional investors who often fail to show up at annual general meetings, one private shareholder asked why votes were not being passed by a show of hands.  'Surely the true shareholders are the ones that are here now?'he said to a chorus of approval. Another complained about big investors abstaining on thorny issues: 'You can't make your mind up? That sounds like Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit.'Martin had already hit back at what he considers to be the shortcomings of corporate governance codes, using last week's trading update to deliver a lengthy diatribe.  After the meeting, Martin picked up the theme again, railing against the 'absurdity'of the nine-year rule (after which a director is no longer deemed independent): 'They are saying I should have left in 1992 and the board should be dominated by people who are not connected to the company - and the net effect of that is the culture isn't retained. 'The fund managers we are dealing with at big institutions seem to be very good but [I think] it is the conflict within their own organisations, where you have got people who are trying to box-tick a set of rules,.'The entrepreneur floated JD Wetherspoon on the stock exchange in 1992, when it had just 44 pubs. It now has 900 sites, employing more than 37,000 staff and with annual revenues of £1.8bn. Martin has a 32% stake in the £1.7bn business, worth nearly £550m. Despite the flak, Martin said he had no plans to take the company private: 'I am trying to find a platform for the company that lasts beyond me. The public markets should be the right place for a company like Wetherspoons.'Asked if he had any plans to retire, 64-year-old Martin quoted the celebrated American investor Warren Buffett, who intended to retire 'five years after he was dead'ù.  'I'm hoping to soldier on,'said Martin. 'I am 40 years at the company next month '¶ so I am hoping to do another 40 and then retire.'The advisory group Pirc had advised shareholders to vote against the annual report after Martin spent £95,000 of company money on pro-Brexit beermats and posters without first seeking approval from shareholders. In the end, about 5% of shareholders voted against it, while 6% took issue with its pay policies. With Martin often using the company as a platform to argue for the merits of a no-deal Brexit, the businessman confessed he had not decided who to vote for in the general election: 'I will probably vote for Boris Johnson in this election and feel sorry for the Brexit party.'The 'weirdest thing'about corporate governance, Martin concluded, was that in the end 'nothing ever happens'ù. He had written to shareholders but said he did not receive any replies. 'The box tickers have barked but the caravan has moved on,'he said. ",0,Neutral
We need honesty on the pitfalls of freedom of movement,-0.25,Negative,"Gideon Ben-Tovim (Letters, 16 November) describes as a 'false notion that free movement across Europe has ushered in a regime of cheap labour and the undercutting of wages'ù. I wonder how many low-paid workers this university academic knows personally. My late husband was a construction worker who wore himself out and ruined his health doing hard, and often dangerous, work for many years. I know that wages went down after the influx of cheap labour from eastern Europe. But, far from this making him anti-immigrant, my husband never blamed immigrants for this, but greedy employers who have recruited workers en masse from eastern Europe. The villains here are the employers, not the immigrants who, like British workers, are just people trying to make a living. Of course, free movement is great in many ways, but it is dishonest to refuse to acknowledge that there is a downside - and this is easily remedied: pay all workers a decent living wage, restore collective bargaining, and stop chasing the cheapest labour for the maximum profit in a race to the bottom. In a TV discussion on immigration, a restaurant owner made the following revealing comment: 'Immigrants have a good work ethic that British workers don't have. Do you know, some of my workers have three or four other jobs too.'So having to do several jobs to make a living is seen as desirable instead of the exploitation it is. What next? Children sweeping chimneys? There is a return to a really nasty class snobbery such as we haven't seen for decades, all the worse for being wrapped in fake virtuous 'pro-immigrant'rhetoric which simply masks a smug selfishness by those who benefit from this cheap labour.Jill RooneyAshtead, Surrey '¢ Contrary to what an emeritus professor of sociology may choose to believe, there are multiple academic studies showing that uncontrolled EU immigration lowers wage rates at the lower end of the labour market. Immigrants will do many jobs for the minimum wage while a British worker would expect a differential to be applied, and an energetic foreign 18-year-old with no family commitments within 1,000 miles will often be favoured over a rights-conscious British 40-year-old who seeks time off to care for both her ageing parents and children. As progressives we need to escape from the echo chamber of comfortable and endlessly repeated untruths if we are to persuade voters outside the hyperliberal metropolitan hubs to trust us with their communities and their insecure livelihoods.Christopher ClaytonWaverton, Chester '¢ It is easy for your correspondents to rail against a dinosaur like Len McCluskey from the safety of their ivory towers and the protection of their qualifications. I too favour the free movement of labour and there can be no doubt that we need overseas workers, but McCluskey touches on a truth that explains why the many poorer voters are moving to the right. When workers go for jobs offering low wages and long hours they find are in competition with desperate eastern Europeans living in houses of multiple occupancy, who have been sold lies about the reality of the UK, and are willing to accept this state of affairs in the expectation that things will get better and they can move on. Experience of austerity has given the UK workers fewer illusions and they are unwilling to accept these jobs. The only way the needs of both groups can be satisfied (either in or out of the EU) is for stronger laws on wages and working conditions that are rigorously enforced for the protection of all workers.Andrew RuffBedford '¢ Jeremy Corbyn (Corbyn advances case for liberal immigration regime post-Brexit, 18 November) must know that bringing doctors and nurses from abroad to fill the gaps in the NHS must leave equivalent gaps in the countries from where these doctors and nurses come. Countries such as Poland or Portugal, India or Ireland are in as much need of such talent as the United Kingdom. Advocates of freedom of movement of labour cite internationalism to support their argument. But the very core of internationalism is respecting and supporting other nations and most importantly doing them no harm. Freedom of movement does just that. In the colonial days, Britain plundered the natural resources of other countries. Today we are invited to plunder a far more precious resource, the human resource.

Johnson's 'òGet Brexit done' drumbeat cannot drown out reality for ever,0.125,Positive,"One test of a campaign slogan is how efficiently it helps voters explain their preference to others and to themselves. Why Donald Trump? To make America great again. Why leave the EU? To take back control. Simple. Boris Johnson has found that kind of groove with his pledge to 'Get Brexit done'ù, which is why he beat the phrase like a drum in televised leader debates this week. It packs a lot into four syllables: release from the EU for those who really care, and relief from having to think about it to those who don't. It has the pleasing crispness of a page being turned, while making Labour's policy feel like a threat to reread a grim chapter all over again. As politics, 'Get Brexit done'is snappy; as policy, it is empty. It is the vacuous sequel to 'Take back control'ù, starring the same falsehood about Britain's global stature. Johnson's claim now, as in the referendum campaign, is that leaving Europe is an act of empowerment. It contains the illusion that we, the liberated nation, tell them, the spurned continentals, how things will be. Three years of negotiation tell a different story. The UK tried to retain privileges of EU membership without abiding by the rules, failed, and watched its deal deteriorate as a result. If the Tories win a majority, that pattern repeats all next year. The old movie will be remade with the same gallop towards a cliff edge, cheered on by hardliners lying about 'clean breaks'ù. Johnson's plan is to complete a comprehensive free-trade agreement before transitional arrangements expire next December. More time is available, but he insists it will not be necessary. Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, extension would have to be sought by July. The government would need to make record-breaking progress in final-status talks in the first months of 2020 for Johnson's boast to be vindicated. That looks unlikely. Trade talks between advanced economies can fill the best part of a decade. Ministers have three lines of defence for their improbable timetable. First, the UK and EU start from what Johnson describes as 'perfect alignment and harmony'ù, so there isn't much to adjust. Second, Phil Hogan, the EU trade commissioner, has said a year is sufficient. Third, people said Johnson couldn't ditch the backstop from Theresa May's deal, but he did; he is the naysayers' nemesis. Those arguments are bogus. Citing the status quo as evidence that change will be easy is an old Brexiteer con. As Sam Lowe, a trade expert at the Centre for European Reform, says: 'Where we start isn't what matters, it's all about where we want to end up.'Johnson's plan explicitly mandates divergence from EU norms. Its purpose is to carve out competitive advantage through deregulation. Brussels sees that as a threat to undercut continental businesses and dump substandard goods on EU consumers. The price of market access is set at a high level of compliance with European rules, which Tories despise. The narrowness of the Channel and the Eurosceptic fixation on de-alignment combine to make future trade talks harder than EU dealings with more remote countries. When EU officials nod along with the tight timetable, they are being polite and trying not to spook British voters. The commission wants the deal ratified as much as Johnson does. An imbalance of power favours Brussels as much in the next phase as it did in withdrawal talks. A new hand is dealt but the rules don't change: the lone state gets weaker cards than the bloc of 27. The commission brings cold-blooded negotiators, hardened over decades of top-level technical negotiation. The UK brings a demoralised civil service with little experience of trade talks, instructed by delusional Tories who think free trade is something to do with Britannia and ruling waves. As for Johnson's powers of persuasion, they are fictional. He achieved removal of the backstop by abandoning a promise not to permit a trade border between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain, burning the DUP and reverting to a Brexit model he had once vigorously rejected. That climbdown hints at one method for meeting the December 2020 deadline. If Johnson is prepared to sign pretty much anything to show he has met his promise of progress, he can cobble a deal together - a 'bare bones'agreement, according to Sabine Weyand, head of the EU's trade directorate. That would still need subsequent negotiation and phased implementation, but there is probably a way to stretch transition at the 11th hour, calling it something else to allow Johnson the pretence of not having begged for an extension. First overboard in the great betrayal will be fishermen. Brexit offered them false hope that foreign trawlers would be banished from UK waters. But hated quotas will be back. Other maritime EU states will demand them as a condition of progress in talks over other issues. Johnson will fold, and then systematically let down other voters who trusted him. If returned to Downing Street, he will spend next year climbing the steep learning curve towards realisation that Britain thrives on frictionless access to the single market - something his deal prevents. He will discover the finer points of 'rules of origin'that make it uneconomic for manufacturers to keep links in their supply chains outside the EU. He will notice businesses using transition to activate relocation plans they had drafted for emergency evacuation in case of a no-deal Brexit. His diplomacy will be sabotaged by Tory hardliners paranoid about gravitation back into Brussels' orbit. Impatience for a trade deal with Washington will spur Eurosceptic zealots into battle against any pragmatist who tries to repair relations with Europe. Johnson will lie like crazy to appease both sides, and be despised for the duplicity. That doesn't mean Brexit will still dominate headlines. If the Tories prevail on polling day they will have a mandate to change the subject, and a vanquished opposition will not foist Brussels business back into the news. Jeremy Corbyn is already trying to foist it out of the election campaign. Neither of the main candidates to be prime minister sees benefit for themselves in a realistic debate about Britain's European future. Why should they? Realism is a gloomy song, a meandering number with dissonant harmonies and no prospect of satisfying resolution. It is not a hummable tune. It lacks the upbeat tempo of 'Get Brexit done'ù, which has the makings of a one-hit wonder to top the electoral charts by Christmas. But then the months go by, it is December 2020, Johnson's jaunty tune is an awkward memory. And Brexit is still not done. '¢ Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist ",0.875,Positive
Arron Banks's private Twitter messages leaked by hacker,-0.25,Negative,"Arron Banks's Twitter account has been hacked and the entire private message history of the Leave.EU founder uploaded to the internet, in what appears to be a targeted attack that has been reported to the police. The founder of the pro-Brexit campaign group, who has been the subject of questions about the source of his group's funding and rule breaches during the EU referendum, confirmed the hack and accused Twitter of leaving his personal data available for anyone to access for almost 24 hours. Leave.EU spokesman, Andy Wigmore, told the Guardian the hack had been reported to the police and they were investigating possible breaches of the Computer Misuse Act. 'The police told us pretty quickly that it was a simswap,'he said, referring to the tactic where control of a phone number is obtained by a hacker, enabling them to gain access to the account. The attack appears to have involved gaining access to Banks's email address, which was registered to an expired campaign website. Someone else appears to now own the domain for that site, which directs users to pornography. Wigmore said he and Banks had been unable to download the hacked messages due to a lack of technical skills. However, they had been sent some by others who had managed to download them. Wigmore dismissed the content as 'gossip'rather than revelations. He also criticised Twitter for the time it took the social media platform to respond to the data breach. Banks has previous experience of the UK's data laws. Earlier this year the information commissioner launched an audit into both Leave.EU and Banks's insurance company, fining the organisations a total of £120,000 for data protection violations during the EU referendum campaign. In recent weeks Banks has split with Nigel Farage over tactics, and his Leave.EU campaign has instead swung behind Boris Johnson's Conservative party, promoting the prime minister's policies. Wigmore said he and Banks were increasingly spending their time away from politics, working on a business growing hemp for CBD products in central America, dubbing themselves the 'Breaking Bad Boys of Brexit'ù. 'We've gone into hemp in a big way because it's Belize and gets six harvests a year. It's not cannabis, you can't get high on it,'he said. Screengrabs of Banks's private Twitter exchanges with journalists and pro-Brexit campaigners have already begun circulating - on Twitter. However, in a sign of the confused online information landscape, fake messages purporting to be from the leak have also been circulating. One account that published false information included the remain campaign group Our Future, Our Choice, which shared a fabricated conversation between Banks and a senior Tory cabinet minister. A spokesperson for Avon and Somerset police said: 'We are investigating whether any offences have been committed under the Computer Misuse Act after we received a report that a Twitter account was compromised.'",-0.5,Negative
Boris Johnson gets down to the business of getting business down,0.25,Positive,"Carolyn Fairbairn tried to put everyone's mind at ease. Opening the annual conference of the Confederation of British Industry at a hotel next to the O2 arena in London, its director general was more therapist than cheerleader. She was truly sorry she hadn't managed to drum up better speakers. But we were in the middle of a general election, so she had felt obliged to ask the prime minister and the leader of the opposition to come along and address them. It wasn't going to be fun, she admitted. Nor was it likely to be in any way reassuring, as both men had only a tangential grasp of economic and business realities and weren't about to tell them anything they wanted to hear. But there were breakout areas at the back of the hall: safe spaces where delegates could process their trauma with expert help. And if necessary, get advice on relocating their businesses to elsewhere in the EU. For those unable to move from their seats, there would be nurses patrolling the aisles at regular intervals to hand out industrial-strength Valium. So everyone should just do their best to nurture one another and remember that it would all be over by lunchtime. And breathe. The health warnings complete, Boris Johnson lumbered on to the stage. 'Tiles ... tiles ... splashback,'he burbled, trying to make himself heard over the crunching of diazepam tablets. Boris shrugged, not bothering to talk in meaningful sentences or even attempting to conceal the fact that he didn't really give a toss. He didn't want to be there, any more than anyone wanted him there. Which actually suited him fine. Because recent opinion polls seemed to show that the less effort he was seen to make, the more the public seemed to like him. The postmodern dialectics of populism. Never had there been a better time to be a lazy, pathological liar. He was going to get Brexit done, he said. This prompted the first overdoses of the morning. Because getting Brexit done was the last thing that was going to happen if the Tories won a majority and the UK left the EU at the end of January. This was gaslighting at its most basic, as not even Johnson believes this any more. 'We'vegotafantasticnewdeal,'he slurred. One that he himself had rejected 18 months previously. There would be no no deal at the end of next year, but there also might not be a deal. It was the same old, same old. Lie after lie after lie. An emetic display of contempt. Halfway through, Boris did vaguely remember this was meant to be tailored to the CBI and not his bog-standard stump speech. So he chucked in a few businessy things - cancelling the reduction in corporation tax that he had claimed would increase revenues in order to save £6bn, reducing national insurance contributions for employers by ensuring businesses would have to lay off staff - before reverting back to slagging off Jeremy Corbyn. 'Venezuela,'he said. 'That bit's true,'he added, surprising himself as well as the hall. It's not often something accurate escapes into one of his speeches. He wouldn't let it happen again. After 20 minutes of verbal nihilism, the CBI president, John Allan, stormed the stage and begged Johnson to stop. Boris took no notice and ploughed on regardless. This was all about him. His needs, his time, his ego. 'If you could wind up as soon as you can,'Allan interrupted. 'Ah, there you are, Allan,'Boris blurted, having not even bothered to learn his host's name. He carried on regardless. Apprentices were good. Especially ones that taught you IT and could be invited on trade missions. An apprentice to whom he could do what he'd like to do to business. As for immigration, only the brightest and the best would be allowed in. Cabbage pickers with PhDs. Johnson smirked when asked about Prince Andrew and left as gracelessly as he had arrived. Jeremy Corbyn was greeted with mere indifference. Which is to say he went down a storm compared with Johnson. It may be touch and go whether the CBI disliked the probability of a botched Boris Brexit more than the Labour leader's plans for renationalisation of public services, but at least Corbyn attempted to engage with the things that mattered to them. A soft, customs union and single market Brexit. The need to reskill the workforce. The climate emergency. Inequality of opportunity. They might not agree on the solutions but Corbyn did seem to have his head and heart in the right place. Much more of this and the Labour leader will be confused with a details man. 'OK,'said Fairbairn, as Corbyn left to a smattering of applause from those who weren't still having their stomachs pumped after Johnson's horror show. 'That's the aversion therapy training session over. Now go off and have some lunch and then join us for some team bonding with Jo Swinson in the afternoon. Jo's going to tell you lots of things about cancelling Brexit that you are going to love.'And she did. And they did. The Lib Dems winning at the CBI.

"Brexit could weaken rules on antibiotics in farming, activists warn",0,Neutral,"Campaigners have warned that the next government must clamp down on the overuse of antibiotics in farming to stave off increasing risks of resistance that are threatening human health. Brexit threatens to open up loopholes in the UK's regulations that would mean diverging from strengthening EU standards on antibiotic use in farming, and the pressure from potential trade deal partners will be to lower standards. C√≥il√≠n Nunan, scientific adviser at the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, told the Guardian: 'Any future government must implement a complete ban on preventive mass medication [of livestock] as a step towards sustainable and responsible farm antibiotic use. Future trade deals should only allow imports produced to UK antibiotic and animal-welfare standards and import tariffs should reflect the benefits of higher-welfare systems, such as grass-fed or organic.'He warned: 'The Boris Johnson deal with the EU makes weaker commitments on maintaining regulatory parity with the EU than the previous May deal did. The government has made it clear it wants to be able to set its own regulatory standards.'Antibiotic use on farms in the UK is controlled in line with EU regulations, but those could be loosened in the event of Brexit. There have already been signs of divergence, according to the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, as the government has to date not committed to a strengthening of the rules that will be enforced EU-wide in 2022. Nunan added: 'The government needs to do far more to encourage a shift towards better animal husbandry to improve animal health and welfare, so that there are fewer infections in the first place. Sweden, which has higher minimum animal-welfare standards, has the lowest level of farm antibiotic use in the European Union.'Problems include the very early weaning of piglets, and the very high stocking densities of poultry, which both lead to higher antibiotic use that could be lessened with higher welfare measures. The call comes on the 50th anniversary of a landmark report on antibiotics, the Swann report, that found serious dangers with the overuse of the drugs. The rules are in danger of being watered down by Brexit. Antibiotics of the strongest kind, the last resort for human health, are still allowed to be used in farming, and the data kept on antibiotic use in the UK does not permit a detailed breakdown of how the drugs are used. Powerful antibiotic drugs are also available for unlicensed import over the internet, though they are only supposed to be used under veterinary supervision. Agriculture would form a key plank of any new trade deal, but major exporters such as the US and many south American countries have less strict controls on the use of the drugs than apply in Europe. The Swann report found that the intensification of livestock farming had led to more disease problems and failed to find 'any excuse in logic or theory'for the preventive dosing of herds or flocks with the drugs. Nunan said: 'Fifty years ago, the Swann committee gave in to pressure from vested interests and failed to recommend an end to preventive mass medication, even though it knew the practice was unjustifiable and the cause of a deadly outbreak of antibiotic-resistant salmonella. Half a century later, still no one has come forward with a valid reason for allowing this misuse of antibiotics to continue.'Routine use of antibiotics became popular with farmers, because it can lead to animals putting on weight faster. But such overuse spurs the evolution of resistant germs, leading to a ban on routine antibiotic use for growth-promotion in the UK, the EU and some other countries in the decades since the report. Use of antibiotics in the UK has halved in recent years, but is still higher than before the publication of the Swann report. Some trends are also causing concern among experts. For instance, in the poultry industry, large reductions in antibiotic use have been made, but the use of a class called ionophores has soared to record levels in the last five years. These are not currently used in human medicine, but could be in future. The use of zinc oxide is also to banned at high doses in piglet feed by the EU in 2022, but the UK may not follow the ban. More antibiotics are used on livestock than on people, even though resistant germs can be passed back to humans from animals. The outgoing chief medical officer for England, Dame Sally Davies, has warned repeatedly that growing resistance to antibiotics is now one of the biggest threats to human health, and that it could render routine operations life-endangering. Molly Scott Cato, the Green party MEP who helped push strengthened regulation through the European parliament, said: 'Unhealthy, intensive livestock farming relies on routine antibiotic use but this also poses a risk to human health by encouraging the development of resistant bacteria. The US still has much looser regulation and we can expect any potential trade negotiations if Brexit goes ahead to include pressure on antibiotic restrictions as with other farm safety standards. Our weak bargaining position will make it unlikely that we can resist the pressure, leading to risks to both public heath and animal welfare.'The government's record was defended by Lord Gardiner, the Tory spokesman on farming, who said: 'Strong progress has been made in reducing the use of antibiotics in the livestock sector. We are doing more than many EU countries and Brexit will not change that.'Jane Dodds, the Liberal Democrats' spokeswoman on farming and rural affairs, said: 'As part of the European Union, the UK has made significant reductions in its use of antibiotics in livestock farming - with significant reductions since 2012. The Tories are now risking squandering that progress. Their obsession with a trade deal with Donald Trump would see a bonfire of environmental regulations and animal welfare standards, undermining British farmers.'Labour's Sue Hayman, the shadow minister for environment and rural affairs, said: 'Time and again the Tories have voted down attempts by Labour to enshrine trade deal assurances on animal welfare, health and environmental standards in law. It is clear we can't trust the Tories to uphold our current standards on antibiotic use in farming.'",0,Neutral
Labour complains to Ofcom about Sky's 'Brexit Election' slogan,0,Neutral,"The Labour party has complained to Ofcom about Sky News branding its coverage of December's poll as 'the Brexit Election'ù. The party told the broadcasting watchdog the description 'gives undue and unfair weight to the Conservative party's political agenda'ù, pointing out that the Tories are using the word in their 'Get Brexit Done'campaign slogan. Labour said the news channel's branding 'represents unnecessary and slanted editorialising'ù. The party also wrote: 'We are requesting that Ofcom investigates Sky News for its corporate branding of the general election as 'òthe Brexit Election'. 'We believe it gives undue and unfair weight to the Conservative party's political agenda because it frames the election in terms chosen by Boris Johnson and the Conservative party, which is using Brexit in its campaign slogan. 'It is also, of course, the name being used by one of the political parties contesting seats in the election [the Brexit party], which is seeking to form an electoral alliance with the Conservatives. 'If Sky had chosen the entirely reasonable branding of 'òthe Change Election', that could be argued to favour the Labour party, which is using: 'òIt's Time for Real Change.' 'We do not believe Sky is complying with the special impartiality requirements that must be applied during elections - with particular reference to sections 319(2)(c) and 320 of the Communications Act 2003. 'We believe this corporate branding represents unnecessary and slanted editorialising by Sky. It is the voting public who should decide what issues - and their range and balance - define the election for them. 'Voters might consider it to be the NHS Election, the Climate Election or the Foodbanks Election, depending on their priorities. 'We have raised the issue at a senior level with Sky News on numerous occasions since the branding first appeared. 'It has been made clear that Sky intends to continue to use the branding. We therefore believe we have exhausted our complaints with the broadcaster so we are asking Ofcom to investigate.'A spokesman for Ofcom said it was assessing the complaints before deciding whether or not to investigate.

Roland Rudd exits People's Vote amid continuing rancour,0.125,Positive,"Roland Rudd has stepped away from the People's Vote campaign, leaving two of his allies in charge of the organisation. The City executive and head of Finsbury PR resigned as the chairman of Open Britain, one of the pro-EU groups campaigning for a second referendum and the largest constituent organisation under the People's Vote umbrella. Open Britain's new chair is Anne Weyman, a former chief executive of the Family Planning Association, the Times disclosed. Her deputy is Geeta Sidhu-Robb, the founder of Nosh Detox, a nutrition business. There still appears to be no obvious route back for the two former staff members who were ousted by Rudd and his supporters, the campaign's former director, James McGrory, and the former head of communications, Tom Baldwin. They were kicked out last month in a 'boardroom coup'and have been prevented from returning to its offices in Millbank, central London. The move prompted a walkout of staff, most of whom are still to return. Lord Mandelson, Alastair Campbell and Trevor Phillips were among the remain luminaries who criticised Rudd's tactics. Staff claim that Rudd's coup was possible because he had quietly taken control of Open Britain using another company, Baybridge. The two warring sides have been trying to come to a compromise, but cannot agree on basic facts. While Rudd's supporters say he also resigned on Friday as the chair of the People's Vote campaign, staff insist he was never installed in that position. 'It would be like Idi Amin resigning as the King of Scotland,'said one. A source close to staff members opposed to Rudd said they had made an offer to management in the last 24 hours which would allow them to return but were yet to receive a response. 'We want to get this campaign back on track but have been prevented from doing so because of boardroom machinations and a hostile City-style takeover of a popular movement. 'The changes at Open Britain are just window dressing because Roland Rudd still controls Baybridge. 'A meaningful deal has been on the table for 24 hours '¶ we are still awaiting a response from the Open Britain board,'the source said. A friend of Rudd said he had always planned to step down and was pleased that two women would now take the organisation forward. 'He said on several occasions that he wished to leave the organisation in good hands,'the friend said. ",0.125,Positive
One in five British people are disabled. So why does politics continue to ignore us?,-0.75,Negative,"The issue of disability rights has risen socially and culturally in recent years. Politically, however, disabled people remain in the shadows. Austerity has been brutal for disabled people. In 2017 the UN accused the government of violating disabled people's rights and causing a 'human catastrophe'ù. Disabled people in Britain remain some of the most marginalised and forgotten people in British society. As the Brexit debate has raged on, silence has prevailed when it comes to its implications for disabled people - the challenges they are likely to face or the measures being put in place to mitigate fallout. The European Accessibility Act of 2015 ensures that products and services are accessible to disabled people. This Act makes a vital difference to millions of people: what will happen to it when we leave? The European Social Fund currently gives £500m a year to organisations in the UK that provide employment and training support for disadvantaged groups including disabled people. MPs have warned that the loss of this fund could be 'disastrous'ù. What measures are there to reduce the damage? Even the Tory former care minister Caroline Dinenage admitted that 'no formal impact assessment'had been carried out by her department to review the impact of a no-deal Brexit on disabled people. According to government data, there are 13.9 million disabled people in the UK. That means disabled people make up 22% of the UK population - more than one in five. Surely policies affecting the lives of so many people should be prioritised? With an election around the corner, politicians would be foolish to underestimate the voting power of such a large proportion of the population. Disabled and vulnerable people must not be left out when it comes to voting at this election. The postal vote helps those with accessibility issues, but it is also essential that disabled people are visible at polling stations, on election day, to promote inclusion. Plans must consider the weather challenges that come with a December election. There's now an agency responsible for publishing accessible versions of party manifestos and providing guidance for returning officers to make their polling stations accessible. Resources and infrastructure must be made available to ensure they do so. Growing up in Kenya, my family and I had to flee my village because the community thought my disability had brought a curse. They wanted to burn our house down. We are a long way from this in the UK, but disability hate crime is on the up, and many disabled people are experiencing poverty and isolation. One of the critical steps to real inclusion is the full representation of disabled people in political life - from representation in the electorate via accessible voting through to party membership and leadership roles. Disabled people must be in the room, on panels and in leadership teams. In a truly inclusive society, it would be the norm to see disabled people represented by and integrated into all areas of political life. Until this happens, our voices remain silent. I urge every person engaged in politics - from the community level to the national - to make sure you bring disabled people into your movements. Broaden your discussions. You cannot legislate for what you do not know. When society denies disabled people a voice and a platform in the decisions that affect our lives, we are left further and further behind. We need structural, systemic change. Disabled people must get proper access to all aspects of social life, and barriers must be broken down - physical barriers in our society, and mental barriers in people's assumptions about disability. We need to reimagine society, with disabled people moved from the shadows to be part of everyday life. Disabled people must be at the centre of discussions; their perspectives and solutions are urgently needed to make society inclusive and equitable. And that goes too for Brexit preparations, otherwise the rights of disabled people in the UK could be seriously and unfairly damaged.

Labour and DUP demand clarity on Northern Ireland fishing,0.125,Positive,"Labour and the Democratic Unionist party have formed an unprecedented alliance to demand that the government explains whether Northern Ireland's fishing waters will be controlled from London if Boris Johnson's proposed Brexit deal becomes law. In a sign of further confusion over how prime minister's withdrawal agreement will work, the parties' fisheries spokesmen have written to the environment secretary, Theresa Villiers, asking why her department appears to claim that fish caught in waters off the coast of Northern Ireland will no longer be classed as Northern Irish fish. Labour's Luke Pollard and the DUP's Jim Shannon wrote that the province's fishing industry of 300 boats were questioning who will be in charge over customs, taxes, visas and enforcement of rules. The letter, sent before parliament dissolved for the election and leaked to the Guardian, can be disclosed after Johnson appeared to misunderstand his own Brexit deal on a visit to Northern Ireland on Thursday. In a video shot in Northern Ireland on Thursday night, Johnson told exporters they would not need to fill in customs declarations when they sent goods across the Irish Sea, adding that if firms were asked to they should call him and he would 'direct them to throw that form in the bin'ù. This contradicted the view of Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, who told a House of Lords committee that businesses would need to complete 'exit summary declarations'for such sending shipments. In the letter, Pollard and Shannon wrote: 'We are taking the unprecedented step of writing a joint letter to you as the Labour and the DUP's spokespeople on fisheries to raise concern about the Brexit deal and fisheries in Northern Ireland.'In the final week of October, officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told the Northern Irish fishing industry that direct landings of fish into Northern Ireland would be subject to new obligations as if they were landing in an EU port, they wrote. 'This would include the requirement to issue catch certificates and they [the officials] warned that tariffs could apply to these landings,'the letter said. The letter points out that the department's press office attempted to clarify matters by issuing a second statement to the Guardian, which said: 'The Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement bill applies EU customs legislation in Northern Ireland but excludes the territorial sea.'The letter continued: 'This seems to suggest that Northern Ireland's territorial waters are excluded from the Northern Ireland protocol, meaning they remain in the GB customs and VAT territory and not in the Northern Ireland/EU customs territory. 'These two statements seem to suggest that the fish caught by Northern Irish fishers off the coast of Northern Ireland may no longer be classed as Northern Irish fish. This would suggest that the border the prime minister promised he would not introduce, but has, is not in the middle of the Irish sea but on the quaysides and beaches of Northern Ireland,'they wrote. The letter posed a series of questions about regulation and taxes. It added: 'If a Northern Irish vessel departs a Northern Irish port and catches fish in what was, until now, Northern Irish waters and returns to the Northern Irish port with their catch, will tariffs, prior notification, catch certificates and additional paperwork be required?'The government has not replied to the letter, according to Labour sources. Asked for a response by the Guardian, a government spokesman said: 'We have renegotiated a new deal which allows us to leave the EU without disruption. Tariffs will not apply to Northern Ireland exports to the EU, including exports of fish landed by Northern Ireland fishing vessels.'",0.125,Positive
No 10 accused of ignoring evidence of Russian interference,0,Neutral,"Experts have accused Downing Street of wilfully ignoring evidence of Kremlin interference in the 2016 referendum and other elections by its refusal to clear the intelligence committee's report into Russian infiltration of British politics. The head of a research group, who has given evidence to parliament of efforts by Russian media and fake Twitter accounts to boost leave during 2016 referendum, said the failure to publish was 'completely untenable'ù. Mike Harris, the chief executive of 89up, said: 'There is evidence of Russian attempts to boost the extremities of the Brexit debate - mostly on the leave side. Russia will be doing something similar this time, but we don't seem to want to learn the lessons.'Earlier this week, Boris Johnson refused to clear a special report by parliament's intelligence and security committee into Russian attempts to infiltrate British politics - meaning that it cannot be published before the election. Dominic Grieve, the committee's chairman, admitted that he had been effectively gagged by the decision in an interview with Sky News, and said he could not even say whether the report uncovered evidence of interference in the referendum or 2017 election. In reply, the former attorney general said: 'I'm afraid, I'm just not going to answer that question because that would be disclosing the content of our report. I'm sorry, but no I'm not about to break the law.'But Grieve did say publication now would have been timely: 'It's certainly pertinent to an election. There has been a lot of disquiet about the possibility of Russian interference and part of our report looks at that.'The committee is understood to have looked at Russian attempts to influence social media discourse as part of an 18-month inquiry into Kremlin attempts to sow discord in British public life - following on from previous analyses. 89up provided research to a separate parliamentary inquiry into fake news and disinformation conducted by the digital, culture media and support select committee, demonstrating Russian attempts to influence the Brexit debate. The organisation concluded pro-leave material from Kremlin-backed channels RT and Sputnik promoted online was worth between £1.4m and £4.1m on a commercial basis during the 2016 campaign - while fake Twitter accounts linked to Russia were engaged in pumping out tens of thousands of Brexit-related tweets around polling day. The Electoral Reform Society said a wider opportunity to clean up election law had been missed, partly because no formal assessment had been made. Jess Garland, director of policy and research for the Electoral Reform Society, said: 'The lack of transparency and action on plausible threats fosters distrust.'Grieve also indicated the suppressed Russia report examined a broad range of issues relating to Kremlin activities in the UK. Concerns were submitted to the committee about donations made by Russian-born individuals to the Conservative party; while members examined the poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury, which ultimately led to the death of a British woman, Dawn Sturgess. Downing Street has repeatedly said that the clearance process takes around six weeks for a document that was submitted to it on 17 October. But that has been disputed by Grieve, who says the normal timescale was 10 working days, to the irritation of No 10, who in turn have accused him of playing political games. ",0,Neutral
"Brexit transition period will not be extended past 2020, says Gove",0,Neutral,"Michael Gove has promised that the UK will have struck a trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020 and will not extend its transition period, despite Boris Johnson having failed to meet his previous Brexit deadline. The cabinet minister confirmed the pledge tying a Conservative government's hands if the party wins a majority, saying it was realistic because Johnson had secured a deal with the EU within 90 days. In fact, Johnson's deal is heavily based on Theresa May's deal, which took about 18 months to negotiate, and most international trade deals take years to finalise. The Cabinet Office minister set out the promise on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, where he also unleashed a series of personal attacks on Jeremy Corbyn for taking Vladimir Putin's side and being a 'non-league player'in politics against Johnson's 'Premiership goalscorer'abilities. He branded Corbyn's claim that he could renegotiate the Brexit deal within three months as 'beyond the realms of fantasy and science fiction and fairytale'ù, branding him a 'terminally weak leader'ù. Gove also questioned how Labour could do a deal with the EU and then campaign against it, singling out Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, as having said she would back remain even though John McDonnell, Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry have all taken the same position. Pressed on difficult issues for the Conservatives, Gove said there would be a full independent inquiry into Islamophobia but he could not say who would run it and he defended the prime minister's refusal to publish a report about Russian interference in British democracy, saying it was going through the usual procedures. With the gloves now off in the election campaign, Labour is also launching its own assault on Johnson's aim to have a quick post-Brexit trade deal with the US, which could allow maggots in orange juice and rat hairs in paprika. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said Johnson's plans for a trade deal would lead to lower food standards and could bring higher prices for medicines. 'If you vote for the Conservative party, you get a hard Brexit which I think will damage our economy. It will also lead to the breakup of the union,'he said. 'That's one side. The other side [Lib Dems], you have got revoke [article 50] - I know a lot of people who voted remain, and are passionate about remain, who don't think revoke is the right thing to do.'He continued: '[With Labour] you are voting for the chance for the public to decide the future. You are voting for the public to be asked: 'òDo you want to leave with this deal, or do you want to remain?''He said it did not matter where Corbyn and he personally stood on the issue of leaving with a Labour deal or remaining in the EU, although he has always made clear he would want to campaign to stay in the bloc.

"Johnson's Brexit would be Thatcherism on steroids, says Corbyn",0,Neutral,"Jeremy Corbyn is to accuse Boris Johnson of seeking to 'hijack'Britain's exit from the EU in order to unleash 'Thatcherism on steroids'by slashing workers' rights and throwing the NHS open to US corporations. With Labour's stance on Brexit under intense scrutiny, Corbyn will promise an audience in the leave-supporting Tory-held seat of Harlow, Essex, on Tuesday that he will 'get Brexit sorted'within six months. Labour is again trying to appeal to both leavers and remainers at this election by promising another referendum - but declining to say how a Labour government would campaign in it. Corbyn will be introduced by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, who will explain how the party plans to renegotiate a Brexit deal within three months, which Labour says would then put to the public in a referendum by next June. Starmer is among those who had pushed for Labour to announce that it would campaign for remain in that vote - but that view did not prevail at the party's conference in September, and Corbyn insisted on Sunday: 'The debate is over.'Many Labour MPs in remain-supporting constituencies fear that the more ardently pro-remain Liberal Democrats could benefit at their expense. The Labour leader's address in Harlow will be his second major speech since the election was announced. Corbyn is to say: 'A vote for Johnson's Conservatives is a vote to betray our NHS in a sell-out to Trump. Johnson's Trump-deal Brexit puts a price tag on our NHS. So we'll say it again and again until the message gets through to the White House: our NHS is not for sale.'Johnson has highlighted the UK's ability to strike free trade deals with non-EU countries, including the US, as a key benefit of his Brexit agreement over Theresa May's, although Trump himself has raised doubts about that.  The prime minister's deal also shifted assurances about labour laws and environmental standards from the legally-binding withdrawal agreement into the non legally-binding political declaration. Corbyn will warn that means the government is preparing to slash workers' rights. 'What Boris Johnson's Conservatives want is to hijack Brexit to unleash Thatcherism on steroids,'he will say. 'Margaret Thatcher's attack on the working people of our country left scars that have never healed and communities that have never recovered. 'The Conservatives know they can't win support for what they're planning to do in the name of Thatcherism. So they're trying to do it under the banner of Brexit instead.'Labour knows Brexit will be a key issue in the election on 12 December, but Corbyn is also seeking to shift the agenda on to other issues, including the climate emergency. Johnson has insisted he is the party leader who will 'get Brexit done'ù, with the 'oven-ready'Brexit deal he struck in Brussels last month. The prime minister wrote to Corbyn on Monday night, accusing the Labour leader of failing to make clear what his policy was on Brexit. 'Your current position seems to be that you want to go back to square one. You want to throw out the great new deal we have reached with our European friends, and instead negotiate a whole new treaty from scratch,'Johnson wrote. 'Even assuming the EU agrees to go back to the very beginning, this will take months and possibly years to do - under your proposals, 2020 will be lost to more dither and delay over Brexit. Voters also have the right to know: what would your supposed Brexit 'òdeal' actually take back control of?'He challenged Corbyn to rule out supporting revoking article 50 to cancel Brexit if the general election resulted in a hung parliament and Labour entered negotiations with the Lib Dems. Jo Swinson's party has said it would revoke article 50 if it formed a majority government. ",0,Neutral
PM accused of cover-up over report on Russian meddling in UK politics,0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson was on Monday night accused of presiding over a cover-up after it emerged that No 10 refused to clear the publication of a potentially incendiary report examining Russian infiltration in British politics, including the Conservative party. Downing Street indicated on Monday that it would not allow a 50-page dossier from the intelligence and security committee to be published before the election, prompting a string of complaints over its suppression. The committee's chairman, Dominic Grieve, called the decision 'jaw dropping'ù, saying no reason for the refusal had been given, while Labour and Scottish National party politicians accused No 10 of refusing to recognise the scale of Russian meddling. Fresh evidence has also emerged of attempts by the Kremlin to infiltrate the Conservatives by a senior Russian diplomat suspected of espionage, who spent five years in London cultivating leading Tories including Johnson himself. It can now be revealed that Sergey Nalobin - who once described the future prime minister as 'our good friend'- lives in a Moscow apartment block known as the 'FSB house'because it houses so many employees from the Kremlin's main spy agency. The committee's report is based on analysis from Britain's intelligence agencies, as well as third-party experts such as the former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, and is subject to a final clearance from Downing Street. That has to come before parliament is dissolved on Tuesday if it is to be released ahead of the election. Downing Street sources stated that was not now expected to happen in time, claiming the sign-off process typically takes six weeks. A No 10 spokesman added: 'There are processes reports such as this have to go through before publication, and the committee is well-informed of these.'However, it is understood the dossier has already been approved by the intelligence agencies themselves as part of a long clearance process that began in late March. Downing Street was sent a final draft on 17 October and had been expected to sign off the report by the end of last week. Grieve said: 'The protocols are quite clear. If the prime minister has a good reason for preventing publication he should explain to the committee what it is, and do it within 10 days of him receiving the report. If not, it should be published.'The dossier specifically examines Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 EU referendum. Members of the committee - which meets in secret because of the sensitivity of its work - had wanted to make recommendations to introduce greater safeguards ahead of the December poll. Ian Lucas, a Labour MP who sits on the culture media and sport select committee, which has conducted related inquiries into the conduct of the EU referendum said 'the government needs to come clean about its view on Russian interference in British politics'ù. Ministers have argued that there are no examples of successful Russian interference in UK elections, but Lucas said that this needed to be properly tested: 'This decision looks like it is designed to avoid proper scrutiny of what we actually know.'Allegations that Moscow money has flowed into the Conservative party via emigres living in the UK making high-profile donations, were also heard by the committee - although the party has consistently denied receiving money improperly. In 2014, Lubov Chernukhin - the wife of the former Russian deputy finance minister - paid £160,000 to play tennis with Johnson and David Cameron. The match was the star lot at a Conservative summer party auction. Another guest at the 2013 fundraiser was Vasily Shestakov, Vladimir Putin's judo partner. Committee members were also briefed on an extraordinary - and for a while an apparently successful - attempt to penetrate Conservative circles by Nalobin, who instigated a pro-Kremlin parliamentary group, the Conservative Friends of Russia. During his time in the UK, Nalobin went to exclusive Tory fundraising events and met senior Conservatives. In January 2014 he posed for a photograph with Johnson at an event at city hall in London. Nalobin posted it on Twitter, writing in a caption that the then mayor was 'our good friend'who said 'warm words'about Russians. Conservative Friends of Russia held its 2012 launch party in the Russian ambassador's Kensington garden, with about 250 Russian and British guests present, including Tories who went on to play a prominent role in the referendum campaign. One was Matthew Elliott, now chief executive of pro-Brexit group Vote Leave, alongside Dominic Cummings, now the prime minister's chief strategist. Another guest was Johnson's future girlfriend Carrie Symonds, a Tory party activist. At the time she worked in the office of John Whittingdale, the pro-Brexit MP who was the group's honorary vice-president. The group collapsed after revelations of Nalobin's alleged ties with the Kremlin's SVR foreign intelligence agency. Over the weekend, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, raised questions over Cummings' connections to Russia, and the levels of security vetting to which he had been subject, after an official whistleblower raised concerns with her. Thornberry asked if Cummings had been asked about his relationship with members of Conservative Friends of Russia, as well as the purpose of his three-year period of work in post-communist Russia between 1994 and 1997. The Guardian's investigation was carried out with the The Insider, an independent Russian news website. Property records show that Nalobin owns an apartment at Michurinskiy Prospect 27, in south-west Moscow. The block's ties with state spying are so well established that sellers are able to advertise their properties in the 'FSB house'at above market rates. Peers held a special debate about the withheld dossier, after an urgent question from the cross-bench peer David Anderson, a national security expert, who insisted the delay was unjustified. 'It invites, I'm afraid, suspicion of the government and its motives,'he said. Earl Howe, responding for the government, told peers: 'The length of time that the government had had for this report is not at all unusual. It was delivered on 17 October - that is not a very long time ago. And the prime minister is entitled to take his view on what the report contains.'Stewart McDonald, the SNP's defence spokesman, said: 'Parliament is about to be sent packing into a general election without fully understanding the extent to which Russia has meddled in our most recent democratic electoral events.'",0,Neutral

UK campaigners call for citizens' assembly to repair democracy,0,Neutral,"A citizens' assembly is needed to reform Britain's democracy because parliament has failed to deal with the chaos over Brexit, respond to climate change or shore up the economic system, according to 70 campaigners including the environmentalist Jonathon Porritt and the former Labour cabinet minister Hazel Blears.In a letter to the Guardian, they call on the government to set up a special people's assembly to tackle the urgent problems with the UK's democratic system.

'If I don't, then we just get deadlock part two, more delay, and we cannot move on.'His message is that Winchester will be a key barometer of the strength of the Remain vote up and down the country on 12 December. If this seat falls to the Lib Dems, then so, too, will many others like it. For the Conservatives to win, they not only need to take Labour seats in Leave-voting parts of the Midlands and the north, but also hold off the Lib Dems in Remain strongholds like Winchester. Brine himself is a strong Remainer who lost the Tory whip for voting for the Benn Act (to stop a no-deal Brexit) in September, but had it restored last week for backing the withdrawal bill. He resigned as a health minister in March - also over Brexit - and describes himself a 'one-nation centrist'ù. Brine's moderate credentials and track record as a hardworking local MP mean he is well liked in prosperous Winchester, a seat that the Lib Dems held before 2010 but that he retained with a majority of 10,000 over them in 2017. Despite all this, it may not be enough to save him and the Tories on election day. On the city's streets there is not only a deep dislike of Brexit, but also a profound distrust of the prime minister, Boris Johnson, even among people who have voted Tory in the past. Kevin Hayter, who co-owns a local construction company, voted Tory in 2010 and 2015 when David Cameron was leader, but said he would never do so again because the party had changed utterly. 'They are now a tawdry, deceitful lot who kicked out all the decent one-nation Tories and I can't vote for them. And, of course, there is Brexit. Neither will I be voting Labour. They are just pernicious and seem to spend all their time purging moderates.'A few yards along the high street, Ian McCoy, a chartered surveyor, said the Tories had headed off to the 'far right'ù. He believed they would be rejected by the people of Winchester. 'Winchester is full of a lot of very reasonable, sensible people who don't like that kind of politics,'he said. Asked about Johnson, he shook his head and said he was 'just a buffoon'ù. Certainly there are those who want Brexit delivered. Fiona Mather, a Tory member of the city council, believes that Brine will win again because 'people have become more pragmatic and just want to get Brexit done'ù. But there was not a huge amount of evidence of that pro-Brexit pragmatism on a wet and wintry Friday afternoon. Most people were pragmatic in a different way: they wanted a moderate politics, a country tolerant of immigrants and close to the EU. And if that meant voting tactically to get the Tories out, then plenty were prepared to do just that. Previous Labour voter Greig Sturges, 27, who works for children's services at Hampshire county council, was planning to go for the Lib Dems this time. He is a Leaver turned Remainer. 'In 2016 I was sucked into thinking it would be an anti-establishment vote, and I was taken in by the lies. But I would vote Remain now, definitely.'Jo Swinson and her party, which now has 20 MPs, are sure to blitz Winchester when the campaign gets under way this week, as they will other Tory-held seats where they are strong locally, like nearby Eastleigh and St Albans. Success in this year's European and local elections have put them on a roll. Defections from Labour and the Conservatives have swelled their ranks in parliament and raised hopes of new conquests in areas where Remainers outnumber Leavers. Former Labour MPs Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger are standing for the party in the Cities of Westminster and London, and Finchley and Golders Green respectively. Ex-Tory MPs Sarah Wollaston and Antoinette Sandbach will be the candidates in Totnes and Eddisbury, where they represented the Conservatives before switching; former Conservative justice minister Phillip Lee is standing in Wokingham; ex-Tory minister Sam Gyimah will be battling for them in Kensington; while former Labour MP Angela Smith will be the candidate in Altrincham and Sale West. Last week the Tory health secretary, Stephen Dorrell, was also selected as candidate in Buckingham. Back in Winchester, Paula Ferguson, the Lib Dem candidate, who has only been a local councillor since May and describes herself as new to politics, was full of enthusiasm. She said she wanted to focus on local issues, too, to swell her vote. But as she did the rounds in the rain, few people seemed interested in the more parochial matters. A local GP, Dr Jo Batten, said Ferguson would have her vote. 'Because of Brexit,'she said. 'Boris Johnson is so dishonest and only sees politics as a game.''¢ This article was amended on 4 November 2019. The original described Fiona Mather as one of only two Tory members of Winchester city council. There are actually 17 Conservative councillors. ",0.625,Positive
"The more Nigel Farage plays Brexiters for fools, the more they seem to like it",0.625,Positive,"Brexit supporters expect 'the elite'ù, 'the establishment'ù, 'the Westminster bubble'to 'rig the system'to stop them 'taking our country back'ù. The enemy imposed metric measurements, drink-driving laws, immigrants and smoking bans and now it wants to stop Brexit. They take us for fools. They think we are stupid. And yet their actions show that cynics who doubt everything trust Nigel Farage, even though he takes them for absolute idiots. It was an education to watch him make his offer of a Leave alliance to Boris Johnson on Friday. Farage's warm-up acts played all the old tunes. Richard Tice, a property investor who has the well-cut suits and fading good looks of the type of charmer who cons widows out of their savings, said the Tories lived in the 'stinking rotten borough of Westminster'ù. Claire Fox, who, satisfyingly, looks as malicious in the flesh as you would expect a member of the Revolutionary Communist party who ended up on the hard right via a spell denying the massacre of Bosnia's Muslims to look, followed up. The Tories were among the elitists, scoffing behind their manicured hands and calling Brexiters 'xenophobes, ignorant and far right'ù. Ann Widdecombe came next. I won't pretend to understand all, or most, of what she said. But her drift was that the Tories were a pack of liars who would betray Brexit and all who believed in it. Farage then strode to the stage like a televangelist to the pulpit. He posed as the last honest politician in England. Unless Johnson agreed to ditch his deal with the EU, he would run Brexit party candidates against the Conservatives in every seat. Liberals were ecstatic. As Johnson cannot agree to destroy his own settlement, Remainers were relieved. The pro-Remain campaign group Best for Britain estimates that an unspoken agreement between the Brexit and Conservative parties could deliver Johnson a comfortable majority. Now Agent Farage, the Remainer mole, was sabotaging the Tories' chances and with them the chances of Brexit. Yet for a supposedly iron man, Farage sounded remarkably flexible. He praised Johnson's energy and sympathised with his difficulties. He emphasised that he had until mid-November to decide where to run candidates and would almost certainly not run them against the Tory right. 'This is a ferret searching for a hole to reverse down,'I thought. The election campaign has achieved what many thought impossible and lowered the standards of public debate. Johnson does not have a 'deal'with the EU, merely a withdrawal agreement. Every circle of hell remains available for Britain if his Brexit passes, including a few the devil himself has yet to discover. Farage could spin a quiet rapprochement with Johnson a dozen different ways. We remain in the single market and customs union until December 2020. Johnson hopes to negotiate a trade agreement by then. But trade deals take years to complete. Farage and the Tory right could tell their followers we could crash out in December or in June, when we would have to ask for an extension to the transition period to keep the negotiations going. Farage could say he would stand down candidates to stop Corbyn. He could say that he had discovered a 'Canada-style trade deal'is possible and rely on the fact that the majority of people do not know what a Canada deal is or why the EU would demand harsher terms from Britain than it demands of a country thousands of miles away. Compromise would betray Brexit purists. But Farage and Johnson are already betraying them. Both say they expect to win in south Wales, the north of England and Midlands, the very areas whose manufacturing industries would be hardest hit by pulling us out of the single market. Then there is the revealing game Farage has played with Brexit party members, which shows how little he thinks of them. He persuaded at least 3,000 to apply to become parliamentary candidates and charged them £100 apiece for the privilege. Yet when the candidates were announced, there were many of the same faces from Farage's Ukip days or Fox's Revolutionary Communist turned Reactionary Chauvinist party. Otto English of the Byline Times, who covered the story, received private emails from working-class hopefuls who said they were told to campaign in byelections to 'increase your chances of being selected'ù. When they got there, no one took their names. Straight afterwards, they received a 'you have not been selected'mass email. Individuals have walked away from Farage. But his core stayed loyal, as the core of populist movements always does. For if there is any meaning in the vapid word, 'populism'can be defined as the willingness of voters to be lied to. The louder they scream 'all politicians are liars'ù, the harder they fall for the big lie from their chosen demagogue. Political scientists define devoted supporters of Farage, Trump and Corbyn as 'low-trust'voters, who believe nothing they hear on the news. And yet they turn as trusting as children when their great leaders lead them on. In the case of Brexit, they are easy to lead and to fool. The divide in Brexit Britain is not based on class but on age and education: 70% of voters whose educational attainment was only GCSE or lower and 64% of over-65s voted to leave. I am not saying that having a degree ensures you are wise or even clever or that every pensioner is suffering from mental decline. But there are good reasons why pyramid sellers and faith healers prey on the uneducated and conmen target widows. If you want people to fleece, these are your best prospects. 'Some ideas are so stupid that only intellectuals can believe them,'runs the old line. But the converse also applies. Some ideas are so stupid that only the uneducated can believe them - and Farage is proving that Brexit is top of the list. * Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist ",0.75,Positive
Dominic Grieve calls for release of report on Russian meddling,0,Neutral,"Dominic Grieve has called for the publication of a report on Russian meddling in the democratic process to be published before the general election, saying it contains knowledge 'germane'to voters. Boris Johnson had been expected to approve publication of the 50-page dossier, compiled by the cross-party intelligence and security committee, by Thursday. His failure to do so sparked calls for its release amid speculation that it could potentially be damaging to the government. 'I cannot think of a reason why he should wish to prevent this report being published,'Grieve, the committee's chairman, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'It's very demoralising for us when we find we put in months of work and at the end of it, we're not getting an adequate response.'Grieve said the report was informative and people should be entitled to access it. 'It seems to us that this report is germane because we do know - and I think it is widely accepted - that the Russians have sought to interfere in other countries' democratic processes in the past.'In a later interview with Sky, Grieve, who was attorney-general from 2010-14, defended the neutrality of the committee, which he said served to inform the public about the security services' effectiveness and the nature of external threats the UK may face - 'in this case concentrating on Russia because of recent events showing Russia is undoubtedly a threat'ù.  The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was among those who called for the report to be published, asking what the government 'have got to hide'ù. 'Yes, it should be released,'he said. 'And I suspect that the reason it hasn't been published is because they're going to delay it past the dissolution of parliament on Tuesday, and then they can hide it away until some point in the future. 'If a report has been called for and written, and it should be in the public domain, then what have they got to hide?'The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, said: 'He [Grieve] has seen it and he says this is something that should be published before we embark on an election and that makes perfect sense to me. 'Because, if there is information that we should know about what has happened in previous democratic events and who has tried to interfere, the public has a right to know and the government shouldn't be keeping it a secret.' The House of Commons was previously told that the report had been sent to the prime minister on 17 October, and Grieve - who will sit as an independent at the next election after he was expelled from the Conservative party over Brexit - said it must be released before parliament is dissolved on Tuesday, otherwise it may never be published. It is understood that the dossier examines allegations that Russian money has flowed into British politics in general and to the Conservative party in particular. It also includes claims that Russia launched a major influence operation in 2016 in support of Brexit. The process for clearing the report on security grounds was completed in the middle of October, after it was finalised in March 2019, but it has since sat with Downing Street awaiting its final release, according to the BBC. The business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, said there was nothing unusual about the failure to publish the report. She told the Today programme she did not know why the publication had been delayed and said: 'I wouldn't accept that it's been held up. I don't think there's anything unusual about this. Many select committee reports are produced and the government has to respond properly. It cannot respond in haste.' John Bercow, the outgoing Speaker of the House of Commons, said on Thursday that he hoped the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, would help expedite the publication of the report and that it would not be necessary for Grieve to raise the matter again.

People are passionate about politics again - and they want radical solutions,0,Neutral,"For two and a half years, British politics has been a pantomime played out in the corridors and boardrooms of Westminster and Brussels. The electorate has barely managed to press their noses against the glass and peer in: much of the Brexit debacle has unfolded out of sight and scrutiny. Instead, ever since Boris Johnson's ascent to the premiership, the country has effectively been treated to a one-sided general election campaign; the opposition has been all but squeezed out of media coverage. All of this now changes: the spectators can storm the stage. In the 00s, it was often claimed that political apathy had replaced political participation. Membership of political parties and electoral turnout were both said to be in irreversible decline. Who can bemoan the lack of political participation now? This is our age of mass politics: the Scottish independence movement, Farageism and Brexitism, a youth-led climate emergency movement, and Jeremy Corbyn's Labour, which began as a husk and flowered into western Europe's biggest political party. And it is this, in large part, that makes the election so unpredictable, so volatile. There is a politicised populace united around a single but fundamental point - desire for rupture with a status quo that never enjoyed enthusiastic support and now has lost popular acquiescence. If Johnson triumphs, his government will wrench Britain out of the EU with a deal that threatens to punch a hole the size of Wales in the economy, and use Brexit to remake British society in a hyper-Thatcherite mould. Labour's mission, on the other hand, is to up-end a generation-long experiment in market fundamentalism and redistribute wealth and power away from its principal beneficiaries. Each represents an abandonment of the old order, even though the Tories' version will benefit the vested interests who bankroll them. The Tories' strategy is clear: use Brexit to torture Labour by dividing its electoral coalition and drowning out its domestic agenda. Their secret weapons are Jo Swinson's Liberal Democrats, who they hope will siphon enough votes from Labour to deliver scores of marginals to the Conservatives - even though Labour is now the only major party committed to a referendum with remain on the ballot paper. Most of the British press will act as Johnson's cheerleaders, and the Tories' traditional donors - hedge fund managers, financiers, magnates - will keep them flush with money. But it is mass politics that presents the party with a challenge. After MPs voted to approve a December election, the grassroots pro-Corbyn Momentum movement launched an appeal to raise £50,000 in 48 hours; instead, it raised £100,000 in the first 12 hours, twice as much as in the same time period in 2017, and with an average donation of £24.40. It belies claims that enthusiasm for the Labour leadership has collapsed among a demoralised membership. And if that commitment to part with money is matched by a willingness to knock on doors, the party will be able to partly bypass an overwhelmingly hostile press and talk to voters one-on-one. It is mass politics, too, which challenges the Tories' ability to monomaniacally focus on Brexit at the exclusion of all else. Polling shows that the environment has risen dramatically as a political priority for voters since January: a new poll finds that two-thirds of Britons believe the climate crisis is the biggest issue facing humanity, with more than half declaring that it would affect how they voted. This is, in part, down to protests by the Youth Strike 4 Climate and Extinction Rebellion. Labour's radical policies for a Green New Deal - which link tackling the climate emergency to creating jobs, overhauling public transport and improving living standards - have yet to cut through. But in an election campaign, we can expect there to be an appetite to hear such proposals. Johnson's strategy is to distance his administration from a lost decade of Tory rule. That deception cannot be allowed to pass. And he must now contend with how those nine years have politicised large sections of the electorate. Wages are still lower than they were before the crash. Parents have been roused to protest over the slashing of per pupil funding. As homeownership collapses, and council housing stock has been sold off en masse, an entire generation has been driven into a private landlord sector where rents are extortionate and security absent. As cuts to benefits have expanded from disabled people to the low-paid, attitudes towards social security have transformed, with most no longer deeming entitlements as too generous. It is for Labour to pin the blame for these crises on Johnson and his colleagues, and to portray attempts to shift the conversation away from them as arrogant Tory indifference. Brexit itself cannot necessarily serve as the distraction Johnson desires, either: in the last pre-election prime minister's questions, the Tory leader was left rattled by Corbyn's focus on the risk of the NHS being flogged off to US multinationals under a Trump trade deal. But focusing on the misery of Tory Britain is a trap. Instead, Labour's campaign should exude a relentless optimism: a sense that a nation this wealthy has the resources to overcome every injustice and challenge if the willpower is there. The age of mass politics is one that demands radical solutions rather than tinkering. Labour may begin the campaign with dire polling, but Tory despair under Theresa May has given away once again to hubris. The movements and struggles of the last decade have politicised millions to demand a breach with a failing social order. It is that resurgence of people power that Labour must tap into - and which Johnson's Tories should surely fear. '¢ Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist ",0,Neutral
The only reason we're having an election is because of MPs' cynicism,-0.25,Negative,"Battle stations. The coming election is just the prelude. This month should have seen Britain's formal withdrawal from the EU, on Boris Johnson's deal, prior to serious trade talks with Brussels next year. The election should have taken place after, not before, formal withdrawal, to elect a parliament to conduct those negotiations - and with the outcome of those talks then validated by a referendum. That would have been dignified and sensible. In theory, that could still happen. The House of Lords could this week delay the election bill - which tears up a constitutional measure, the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, without even bothering to repeal it. If the Lords were not so bloated and gutless, it would delay the bill. In truth, the upper house is not fit for the job. Up to now, the anti-Johnson majority in the Commons had a golden opportunity to take command of Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn could have used his leverage to force through a soft Brexit. His ineptitude in dealing with the minority parties lost him that chance. He shot himself in the foot. Meanwhile the SNP and Liberal Democrats sensed they would win more votes with Corbyn still at Labour's helm than if they waited until next spring - even at the risk of putting Johnson and his hard Brexit back in Downing Street. They put party before country. Never has there been a more cynical Commons than this one. Johnson has not even had to promise - for what that is worth - to 'take no deal off the table'ù. He has merely returned Brexit to square one and concentrated on what he craves: a safe majority. The polls may be unreliable but, with a divided, demoralised opposition, the odds must be on Johnson winning. He will have his unamendable deal passed by January. That is not the end. Next year comes the real moment of truth: proper negotiations on a long-term trade deal with Brussels. Remember, Britain will still be in a transitional customs union, and it will start to be hit by a tornado of economic bad news. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research says Johnson's hard Brexit will cost a staggering £70bn or 4% of GDP, the most savage self-inflicted wound since the hundred years war. Johnson has accepted the EU customs union for Northern Ireland. Perhaps he will eventually see that what's good for Northern Ireland is good for the whole nation.

Tory MPs 'asking Brexit party not to stand against them',0,Neutral,"Tory MPs are asking the Brexit party not to run candidates in their seats at an early general election, according to the party's chair, Richard Tice, as speculation mounts over the anti-EU party's potential pacts in leave areas. Tice said he received a frantic message from one Tory urging him not to stand a candidate in their constituency because they were facing a challenge from the Liberal Democrats. 'It wasn't the first; it won't be the last,'he said. The texter, who sent the message on Monday as MPs returned to Westminster amid early election speculation, said that as a committed Brexiter they should be spared a challenge from Nigel Farage's Brexit party. Tice, a businessman who co-founded the Leave.EU campaign group, said he had already received numerous requests from Tory MPs who are clearly anxious that the Brexit party will have more appeal for their constituents than Boris Johnson's Conservatives. The Brexit party is offering a 'clean'break with the EU - in effect a no-deal arrangement. It has so far vetted 600 candidates for a general election and there is a presumption it is aiming to stand in all 650 seats. The party took 29 European parliament seats at the 2019 election and has four Welsh assembly seats. Farage is still offering the government an alliance or 'non-aggression pact'ù; as both parties want to quit the EU, there is concern that unless they stand aside for each other they might split the vote of Brexit-backing constituents and usher in an opposition party candidate who backs remain or a softer Brexit. The Brexit party wants a free shot at Labour heartland seats and in return it has offered not to run where a Tory MP is enthusiastically backing its brand of Brexit or where a Tory has a reasonable chance at beating a Labour rival. Without a genuine Brexit-backing majority in parliament, the stalemate in the Commons may continue, Farage has warned previously. However, his offer has been robustly dismissed by a No 10 source who said Farage was 'not fit'to be allowed near government. The Brexit party is spending the next few days finalising seats for high-profile candidates such as Farage and Tice, who is an MEP for the East of England, and former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe. As it makes more concrete election plans, it appears it is attempting to align itself with the Democratic Unionist party to form a bloc that could eventually 'hold the balance of power'that the Tories would need to unlock a functioning majority. DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr spoke at one of the Brexit party's most recent rallies and they are said to have an extremely good relationship and to be working ever more closely together. The Brexit party is aiming for up to 50 seats, but even if it returns a low number of MPs, a party source said the DUP had been a case in point at how powerful a small collection of MPs could be in shaping Brexit. The source said: 'We've seen how influential those 10 seats are.'There is an assumption that the DUP and Brexit party could unite with an offer for Johnson should he fall short of securing a majority in an election.

People's Vote staff call on chairman to resign over sackings,0.125,Positive,"The standoff at People's Vote has escalated after about 40 staff called for the resignation of their chairman, Roland Rudd, who has sacked two senior executives and was planning to make a number of new appointments later on Tuesday. The bulk of staff working on the campaign for a second referendum went to confront Rudd at a meeting in a hotel, after he fired James McGrory as campaign director and Tom Baldwin as media director over the weekend. The staff had believed they were to meet Rudd, a City PR firm boss, in their Millbank offices in London on Tuesday morning, with McGrory and Baldwin having vowed to turn up to work as usual. However, Rudd changed the location to the Hilton hotel next door and staff supportive of the sacked executives initially declined to attend. They later moved en masse to the Hilton, where security guards denied entry to Baldwin and McGrory. Following the meeting with Rudd and his new acting chief executive, Patrick Heneghan, 40 staff members said they had no confidence in Rudd and called on him to quit, while three came out in favour. McGrory, who still describes himself as director of People's Vote, said: 'We are asking Rudd and Heneghan to quit because no one - least of all the millions of people in the country who are desperate for us to succeed - can allow boardroom politics to overshadow the real politics taking place on Brexit. 'This has been a brilliant cross-party campaign and this is a crucial week in the fight to stop Boris Johnson forcing his Brexit on the people. We are ready to launch the biggest and most sophisticated tactical voting campaign this country has ever seen if there is an election. 'But Roland Rudd has chosen now to put a wrecking ball through the campaign, locked key staff out of the office and tied others up in legal threats. 'All we want to do is get back to campaigning for a People's Vote. None of us chose to get into a fight with the Open Britain board. Instead, those seeking to disable this extraordinary campaign must now take responsibility for playing into Johnson's hands.'In a letter sent to Rudd on Monday night, the 40 staff told him: 'As the staff of the People's Vote campaign, we demand you allow us to continue with our work under the leadership of James and Tom. This campaign has always been about trusting the people. If you want us to succeed, you must trust us now.'A People's Vote source said Rudd had not wanted to be 'ambushed'at the Millbank offices by people prepared to film him, but that he had waited in the hotel with tea and coffee for anyone who wanted to discuss the management changes. They said the Hilton meeting room was used regularly and the staff had been issued with 'direct orders from the chief executive and chairman'to attend. Rudd and Heneghan were expected to announce more staff appointments later on Tuesday. One person on Rudd's side said concerns about the management of the organisation had been fuelled by a report by some consultants last year. In the report, quotes from those who worked in the campaign included: 'There are dozens of people who have not done a full day of work in weeks. You end up getting shouted at in a meeting so you just go home.'Another read: 'It's a completely unworkable, dysfunctional campaign at the moment. I have never been part of one that has so little accountability.'The report concluded: 'The current governance model, team and culture within [People's Vote] will need a fundamental reboot in order to win a second referendum.'On the other side, some senior People's Vote figures supportive of McGrory and Baldwin said the dysfunctional structure was a result of Rudd's control over the campaign through its parent organisation, Open Britain. One board member also disputed the idea that Rudd had been trying to improve its governance by merging it with other pro-European organisations, saying this had been the idea of the campaign's management. They pointed to an email to Rudd in August in which four People's Vote constituent organisations said they wanted a 'shared ownership of the campaign across all the organisations involved and accountability to its members'ù, and rejected Rudd's 'proposal for a new campaign controlled by Open Britain'as unacceptable.

"Government likely to adopt Lib Dem election plan, says Jo Swinson",0.5,Positive,"The government is likely to accept a Lib Dem plan to force a general election via legislation if, as expected, a new Brexit delay is agreed, the party's leader, Jo Swinson, has predicted. While the government remains officially focused on calling an election through a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA), this would need a two-thirds majority and a third attempt at this route appears destined to fail when MPs vote on Monday afternoon, with Labour set to abstain. If it does not pass, Swinson said she expected Boris Johnson's government to get behind a joint Lib Dem and Scottish National party plan to call an election in December by simply amending the FTPA, which would require a standard majority. 'Absolutely,'Swinson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'This bill is one that we have drafted. It ties the prime minister's hands about the date of the election. It sets it in law, so it doesn't give him the wriggle room that his plan would have. 'I haven't heard from behind the scenes, but I have written to him this morning, so I will hope to get a response this morning.'When the idea for the bill-based election was first revealed on Sunday, Johnson's ministers dismissed it as a 'gimmick'ù. However, Downing Street soon indicated it could adopt the plan if its FTPA-based election bid failed. However, agreement seems some way off amid mutual mistrust over issues such as the fact that a bill could be amended. Asked about the idea on Monday, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, refused to be drawn, calling the government motion the 'quickest and easiest and safest route'to an election. He told Sky: 'What the prime minister is determined to do is get this vote through tonight.'But Williamson said he believed MPs were getting behind an election: 'They are moving to recognition that this parliament isn't going to deliver anything. It doesn't want no deal. It doesn't want a deal. It seems to not want an election. That's not sustainable.'The schools minister, Nick Gibb, told the Today programme Swinson sought an election in order to 'disobey'the mandate given in the EU referendum. 'They want to revoke article 50 and keep us in the EU,'he said. The Lib Dem/SNP plan also opens a divide with Labour, which has said it can only back an election if Johnson categorically rules out no deal, both at the end of January and if no permanent trade deal is in place by December 2020. In seeking an election the Lib Dems have given up on their preference for a second referendum. Swinson said Jeremy Corbyn had been 'missing in action on Brexit'ù, and that without Labour support in parliament a second referendum would not happen. 'I don't see any guarantee that waiting is going to make the Labour party suddenly get a serious position on Brexit,'she said. 'But what waiting would do is risk no deal. Because if we waste this extension and we end up with that 31 January deadline looming, assuming it's granted today, and we haven't done anything with this time, then there's no guarantee the EU will extend again.'Swinson told Today she believed this had helped the EU move towards agreeing a Brexit extension to 31 January. She said: 'One of their big concerns was that they offered an extension earlier this year, said 'òdon't waste the time', and then we had a Conservative leadership election and Boris Johnson mucked about not trying to get a deal, shutting down parliament, the very masterclass in timewasting. So understandably they had a degree of reluctance.'",0.5,Positive
Brexit: EU prepares to grant UK three-month extension,0,Neutral,"The EU is preparing to sign off on a Brexit extension to 31 January 2020 with an option for the UK to leave earlier if a deal is ratified, according to a leaked draft of the agreement seen by the Guardian. After earlier objections raised by the French government, a paper to be agreed on Monday circulated among member states suggests the EU will accede to the UK's request for a further delay. The UK would be able to leave on the first day of the month after a deal is ratified, according to the paper. A source close to Emmanuel Macron said an agreement between the EU27 on the new Brexit extension would 'very probably'be announced on Monday morning following political discussions with London over the weekend, notably a conversation between the French president and Boris Johnson.  The draft paper suggests a no-deal Brexit on 31 October is off the table as demanded by opposition party leaders as a prerequisite for a general election. Until there is official signoff on the agreement, there remains the possibility that the terms could change, but it is the first time firm dates have been written into an official document. 'The period provided for in article 50 (3) TEU as extended by the European council decision (EU) 2019/584 is hereby further extended until 31 January 2020,'the draft agreement says. 'In the event that the parties to that agreement complete their respective ratification procedures and notify the depositary of the completion of these procedures in November 2019, in December 2019 or in January 2020, the withdrawal agreement will enter into into force respectively on [the first of the month of the relevant month].'The potential date of 15 November for the UK to leave the EU - an idea raised by France - is not included in the draft paper. An EU declaration attached to the draft agreement stipulates that the bloc will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. It is also says the UK has 'an obligation'to nominate a candidate to join the European commission. The prime minister has previously said he will not put forward a nominee. The European council president, Donald Tusk, has been in intensive discussions with EU leaders over the weekend. Ambassadors for the EU27 are meeting on Monday morning. Tusk had said he wanted to avoid calling leaders to a summit in Brussels to discuss the issue and would seek to find unanimous agreement to allow sign-off via a 'written procedure'ù. The circulation of the draft agreement suggested Tusk had been successful in convincing France, in particular, that a three-month extension avoids the EU being dragged into the domestic row in the UK.  Among weekend developments that had persuaded Paris to drop its objections to a new delay lasting up to three months was 'the significantly more likely prospect of fresh elections, now backed by several parties including the Liberal Democrats and the SNP'ù, the French official said. The conditions attached to the extension had also been 'further specified and reinforced'on Saturday and Sunday, the source added, in particular the 'non-renegotiability'of the deal and the fact that the 27 will be able to work on the bloc's future plans without the UK. While wishing to preserve the unity of the 27 that had been their guiding principle throughout the negotiations, the source said, Paris had 'insisted on these conditions as necessary'ù. The terms in the draft agreement are in line with those stipulated under the Benn act that forced Boris Johnson to make a request to the EU for a further delay. The extension had been due to be signed off on Friday. But the French ambassador had stood alone at a meeting of EU diplomats in arguing it was not the right time. It was suggested by France's ambassador that only after the vote on Monday should the EU decide to 'go short, to push for ratification, or long to accommodate a general election'ù. Only France insisted the EU wait on agreeing to an extension. Since then, Johnson told the cabinet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, had informed him he was too isolated to insist on a shorter extension. Developments over the weekend, in which the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party agreed to table a one-line bill in which they would back a general election on 9 December, have convinced many EU officials the UK will soon go to the polls. Downing Street has let it be known that if Labour does not support its plan for an short extra period of scrutiny of the withdrawal agreement bill up to 6 November, and then a general election on 12 December, it will look at the joint proposal.

The Labour party and Jeremy Corbyn - stick or twist?,0,Neutral,"Apart from a few diehard loyalists, I imagine most Labour party members would agree with Jonathan Freedland that Labour is not going to come anywhere close to winning an election as long as Jeremy Corbyn remains leader (The question for Labour: why are you sticking with Corbyn?, Journal, 26 October). The only way by which a new leader could be installed in time to fight the imminent election would be if Corbyn resigned, but there is one very good reason why, at the moment, this is simply not going to happen. That is because Tom Watson would become the caretaker leader and in all likelihood fight the election as the prospective next prime minister. This is something not only the left of the party will not countenance, and his association with the Carl Beech case does not help matters. So the obvious thing is for Corbyn and Watson to resign together, allowing the parliamentary Labour party and national executive committee to agree a short-term leadership team that would serve until after the election, when a formal leadership contest would be held. Until then, a Starmer-McDonnell double bill would brighten the political landscape significantly, though I concede that their middle-aged white maleness is an unfortunate side-effect of having to make such a decision under pressure.Michael WoodgateBristol '¢ On 19 April 2017 Jonathan Freedland wrote that Theresa May's decision to call a snap election was 'about the surest bet any politician could ever place'ù. In the event, May lost her majority, and Labour obtained the largest increase of poll share since 1945. Freedland called it wrong because he failed to understand that Corbyn had caught the tide of change by demanding an end to austerity politics. Once again, Freedland is returning to his favourite theme, that Corbyn is unelectable. However, his implicit advice that Corbyn be ditched is manifestly unworldly. It would lead to an internal civil war on the eve of a general election. In predicting a heavy Labour defeat, Freedland may also be calling it wrong again. No one can forecast with any certainty what will happen at the next general election, but it may be that Labour's renewed call for Britain to change direction - through a Green New Deal, a massive public investment in jobs, and a turn to social justice - will once again connect to the tide of change.Prof James CurranGoldsmiths, University of London '¢ I couldn't agree more with Jonathan Freedland. As a member of the Labour party, I wrote to Jeremy Corbyn and pointed out that although much of his manifesto was attractive, it was never going to happen as long as he remained leader - he was simply unelectable, as was Michael Foot. Right or wrong, he carries too much baggage, perceived or otherwise, to overcome the rightwing press. In my opinion, if Keir Starmer were the leader then Labour would walk it. Please, Mr Corbyn, do the right thing for the party that you obviously love.Bernard WrightAustwick, North Yorkshire '¢ Jonathan Freedland hits the nail on the head for so many of us Labour members. On numerous occasions I have written to the Labour leadership making the point that we cannot win the next election under Corbyn but never get a reply. I now think we may have to live with a Tory government that has already devastated our welfare state and will do worse, and work for the election after next when surely Corbyn will have been replaced with one of the several electable members of the shadow cabinet. I only remain a party member because of an excellent MP.Alison WatsonLondon '¢ Jonathan Freedland asks: 'Why are you sticking with Corbyn?'Jeremy Corbyn's leadership has been consistent, clear and strong, both on EU membership and other matters.

Brexit bias? BBC faces a difficult balancing act in polarised nation,-1.625,Negative,"Media bias is always in the eyes of the beholder. So, on one side, those who support leaving the EU regard the BBC as the Brussels Broadcasting Corporation. Those who seek to remain, meanwhile, view it as the Brexit Broadcasting Corporation. This is familiar ground for Britain's major public service broadcaster. Think back to the Troubles, the Falklands war, the Scottish independence referendum. In each case, the BBC was accused of failing to be impartial. This time, however, the attacks pose a more profound challenge. At a time when fewer and fewer people believe what they are told by journalists, the BBC is struggling to convince its audience that it is not subject to sinister influences. The public's media savviness has gradually elided into media cynicism. People are on red alert for bias. They have come to suspect misinformation and propaganda where it does not necessarily exist. Brexit has seen a marked rise in complaints to the BBC, mostly from the pro-leave side. Audience surveys carried out on behalf of the corporation reveal a worryingly negative reaction to its coverage. And a review of BBC news and current affairs by the regulator, Ofcom, released last week, mentioned 'dissatisfaction with the BBC's coverage of Brexit'ù, although it did not record specific examples. The criticism is rooted, partly, in the intense polarisation of each side. Positions have become ever more entrenched, with leavers fearing that a pro-remain establishment, which is thought to include the corporation, is conspiring to ensure that the referendum result is not honoured. Another major factor behind the escalating hostility towards the BBC is the saga's longevity. Brexit just won't get done and, as it drags on, the corporation's detailed daily coverage opens its content to increased scrutiny, and increased scepticism, from viewers and listeners. As Anne McElvoy has pointed out, in a column urging the corporation to underline its commitment to impartiality, 'the strains of Brexit'have made it tricky for BBC journalists to reflect the balance between two fiercely held viewpoints. Audiences do not seem to believe that news editors and their staff take pains to hold the middle ground. Doubtless, people are also influenced by the critics who rage against the BBC's output. Aside from the background hubbub of anti-corporation bile from the usual suspects - newspapers such as the Sun, Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph - there have been specific assaults. Steve Baker, the Tory MP who chairs the European Research Group, accused BBC journalists of asking questions based on false premises. Paul Dacre, the former Mail editor, was as forthright as ever in writing of 'the Eurosceptic-hating BBC'which 'pumps out hysterical anti-Brexit propaganda'ù. In a column for the Spectator he called its coverage 'a disgrace'and singled out its Europe editor, Katya Adler, for special mention, asking if she is 'actually employed by Brussels'ù. This is a silly point. When Adler goes on air, she says what her EU sources have told her. Those sources are anything but happy about Brexit and the UK's handling of the crisis, so it is hardly surprising that her reports reflect that. How, in such circumstances, could she frame her comments differently? Charles Moore, the Telegraph columnist, opened another line of attack back in April when he complained on Question Time about being the sole leave supporter on its panel. This was a specious objection - another guest, the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, had backed remain in 2016 but now favours leaving the EU. Moore's criticism rested, in part, on a flawed study by the Institute for Economic Affairs, which counts panellists on BBC discussion shows based on how they voted in the referendum, rather than their current views on Brexit. Remainers have their own complaints. In this column last week, Emily Bell contended that the BBC's Brexit coverage lacked 'adequate authority'ù. She added that its journalism has 'struggled to be serious and consistent enough to meet the complex gravity of the moment'ù. I beg to differ. There have certainly been moments when I've shouted at the TV and radio because interviewers have failed to ask the question that I felt was essential. But I often have the same reaction to non-Brexit matters. Those cavils aside, the coverage has been informative, if repetitive. Perhaps the most contentious criticism of late has come from Peter Oborne, the journalist who campaigned and voted for Brexit and then, six months ago, changed his mind. In a scathing analysis of Brexit reporting, in which he takes several political editors to task for acting as stenographers for fabricated stories, he included a section on the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. His point, somewhat similar to Dacre's criticism of Adler, centres on her use of anonymous sources. Oborne seized on Kuenssberg's posting of six linked tweets as proof that she was being 'manipulated by Downing Street'ù. Why? Because she conveyed that Boris Johnson's government was holding 'two positions'on the Benn act. On the one hand, it would comply with it. On the other, it was determined not to do so. Kuenssberg's insight relied, as she stated in her tweets, on 'a senior No 10 source'ù. That didn't strike me as unusual, nor did I think it misleading. It was not a lie. Johnson was, at the time, trying to have his cake and eat it. Kuenssberg did nothing more than reflect his ambivalence. As for her use of an unnamed inside source, it is simply how lobby journalism works. But it doesn't have to be that way. I agree with Oborne: it is time for journalists to be more forthcoming in naming the people we quote. None of that should detract from Kuenssberg's fine work, day after day. Fair-minded BBC viewers and listeners may well agree with me. But can we be sure that they are in the majority? ",-0.875,Negative
Police investigating 'Kill Gina Miller' crowdfunding page,0,Neutral,"Police are investigating a crowdfunding page that advocated killing the anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller. The page, which has been on the GoFundMe website since April, sought to raise £10,000 for a hitman to kill Miller, but did not raise any money before it was taken down. A Metropolitan police spokesman said: 'Officers from the Met's south-west CID team are currently investigating a report of threats to kill that was reported to them on Wednesday 23 October. 'Enquiries remain ongoing and the victim, a female aged in her 50s, has been regularly updated.'A GoFundMe spokesman said: 'This campaign has been removed. We are sorry it got through our otherwise robust procedures. We are particularly sorry for any distress this caused Gina Miller.'Responding to the petition on Twitter, Miller said: 'We need to heal our nation and my view is that the only way of doing that is to remember true British values of tolerance, decency, reason, civic duty, common sense and above all else, honesty and kindness.'Miller said she was subjected to rape and death threats after entering the public consciousness three years ago for leading the campaign to ensure parliament had a say in triggering Brexit.

"Brexit referendum should never have been called, say majority of voters",-0.625,Negative,"Twice as many people now think it would have been better never to have held a referendum on Brexit than believe it was a good idea, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. Asked to consider the difficulties the government has had in reaching an agreement, 57% of UK adults surveyed said that they believed it would have been better not to have had a public vote in June 2016. This compares with 29% of voters who believe it was right to hold the referendum on whether the UK should stay in or leave the EU. The findings reflect a growing sense of public weariness about arguments over Brexit, which have paralysed British politics and divided the country. People who voted to remain in the EU are overwhelmingly of the view that the referendum should not have taken place, with 87% agreeing and only 7% saying it was a good idea. Those who voted to leave, however, still have a majority view - although a decreasing one - that it was right to have put the question to the people; 57% of this group said that they believed it was the correct decision, against 32% who now think the reverse. Despite this, the poll gives the Tories under Boris Johnson, who led the campaign to leave, a commanding 16-point lead over Labour, which opposed leaving the EU in the referendum. As Johnson prepares to push for a 12 December general election in a Commons vote tomorrow, the Conservatives are up three points compared with a week ago, on 40%. Labour is unchanged on 24%, while the Liberal Democrats are down one point on 15%. The Brexit party is down two on 10%, the SNP up one on 5% and the Greens down one on 3%. The Brexit deal that Johnson struck with Brussels 10 days ago is regarded by more people as bad for their own financial prospects and those of the UK economy than the proportion who think it will be beneficial. Around 40% of voters think it will be bad for the UK economy as a whole, compared with 26% who think it will be good. With the Brexit deadlock continuing in parliament, opinion among the public is divided on what should happen next. The most popular option, although only by a very narrow margin, is to hold a general election to sort out the impasse. This is backed by 31% of people as the best way forward; 42% of Conservative voters back a general election, compared with 31% of Labour voters who support this as the next step. The next most popular option is to allow the House of Commons the necessary time to pass the Brexit legislation; this is backed by 27% of all voters, including 41% of Tory supporters and 24% for Labour. The option of another referendum is supported by 23% of all voters. Only 5% of Tories support a second vote, against 35% of Labour voters who back one. If there were to be another referendum, the poll suggests the result would be on a knife edge, with 43% of all voters saying they would back remaining in the EU, against 42% who would vote to leave. Adam Drummond, head of political polling at Opinium, said that the latest results showed support for the Tories had continued to grow, although support for Johnson's deal pointed to a more complex set of views on Brexit. 'The Conservatives have hit the symbolically important 40% mark for the first time since before missing the [original] Brexit deadline back in March, and the reaction to Boris Johnson's deal appears to be that the public are divided on whether it will be good for them and the economy. 'To the extent that there is a way out of the impasse, a general election is the most popular individual outcome, but if Johnson's deal were put up against the option of remaining in the EU in a binary referendum, the country remains just as evenly split as it was last time we asked.'",-0.25,Negative
Tories deny plan to compromise workers' rights after Brexit,0,Neutral,"The government has denied it has misled parliament and that it is seeking to tear up provisions for workers' rights after Brexit. The business minister Kwasi Kwarteng admitted on Saturday that it would be very difficult for Britain to leave the European Union next week, but he dismissed reports employees' rights would be slashed after Brexit as 'way exaggerated'ù. He said it was for the EU to decide whether the UK was granted an extension, with deliberations in Brussels continuing into the weekend after Boris Johnson grudgingly requested a delay to Brexit. Fresh scepticism over the agenda of Johnson's government is likely to impact ongoing EU27 discussions after the Financial Times reported that the prime minister was willing to consider diverging from EU standards on the environment and workers' rights. But Kwarteng dismissed the report and said it was completely inaccurate. 'I think this is completely mad, actually,'he told the BBC. 'You've said how we built a coalition - 19 Labour MPs have come with us and voted for a second reading [of the withdrawal agreement bill]. It wouldn't make any sense at all to dilute workers' rights in building that coalition to land the bill.'We have said we will be better than our word. We have said our ambition on securing workers' rights will be stronger than the provision of the bill.'According to the report, the leaked document said the way the political declaration - the agreement setting out the aims of the future trade negotiations between the UK and the EU - had drafted workers' rights and environmental protection commitments left 'room for interpretation'ù. It reportedly boasts that 'UK negotiators successfully resisted the inclusion of all UK-wide level playing-field rules'in the previous deal negotiated by Theresa May's team, allowing Britain to compete against EU members by possibly watering down rights. The document, which has not been shared with parliamentarians or the public, goes to the heart of Labour's concerns that workers' rights and environment rights would be tampered with if the Tories were in power after Brexit. Jenny Chapman, the shadow Brexit minister, said: 'These documents confirm our worst fears. Boris Johnson's Brexit is a blueprint for a deregulated economy, which will see vital rights and protections torn up. 'It is also clear Boris Johnson was misleading parliament earlier this week. You simply can't trust a word Boris Johnson says. Under his proposals, this Conservative government has no intention of maintaining high standards after we leave the EU.'Those fears are particularly felt in Berlin, as speculation mounts that Johnson is preparing to reform the UK into a low-tax, lightly regulated economy described as 'Singapore-on-Thames'ù. He told MPs this week that the UK was committed to 'the highest possible standards'on both sets of rights. This stance helped convince 19 Labour MPs to back his withdrawal agreement bill at its second reading on Tuesday. The Department for Exiting the European Union initially declined to comment on Saturday morning. Later, a government spokesperson said: 'The UK government has no intention of lowering the standards of workers' rights or environmental protection after we leave the EU and we already exceed EU minimum standards in areas such as maternity leave, shared parental leave and greenhouse gas targets. 'UK level playing field commitments will be negotiated in the context of the future UK-EU free trade agreement, where we will achieve a balance of rights and obligations which reflect the scope and depth of the future relationship.' The EU has insisted any future relationship should be based on a level playing field. After a meeting of EU ambassadors on Friday, a Brussels source said there was full agreement on the need for an extension and that work would continue over the weekend. The final decision on whether the EU will opt for an extension until January or a shorter November delay is not expected until Monday or Tuesday. It is believed that Emmanuel Macron, the French president, is not in favour of the extension stretching into the new year. Kwarteng said: 'I think it will be very difficult to leave on 31 October precisely because of the Benn act, the surrender act, which essentially gave authority to the EU, the other side, about whether we will leave on 31 October or not. It looks like they may well give us an extension.'",0,Neutral
MPs plan to defy Boris Johnson by forcing Brexit votes,0,Neutral,"Rebel MPs are exploring ways to seize control of the agenda from Boris Johnson by allowing parliament to debate and vote on Brexit legislation and a second referendum possibly as soon as next week. Several MPs told the Guardian this was a plan under consideration if Johnson persisted with his insistence that his withdrawal agreement bill was 'paused'until MPs agree to an election on 12 December. Under the plans, which have been worked on since the summer by supporters of a second referendum and soft Brexit, MPs would again try to use procedure under standing order 24 to take control of the timetable in parliament. They would then attempt to introduce either Johnson's Brexit deal or Theresa May's withdrawal agreement, with possible votes on adding a customs union, second referendum and extending transition to prevent departure on World Trade Organization terms. It is understood some MPs have been discussing the plans with former EU officials to determine whether it could be enough to demonstrate to Brussels that parliament was serious about using an extension to break the Brexit deadlock. Johnson was still insisting on Friday that he would refuse to bring back his Brexit legislation unless MPs granted him a general election on Monday. He called on Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, to 'man up'and vote for one, claiming that parliament would only engage in 'pointless Brexitology'if given the chance to debate his legislation without a hard deadline. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, claimed the government would simply lay motions 'again and again'until other parties agree to go to the polls. However, Corbyn made clear he would only vote for an election if Johnson made 'absolutely clear'to parliament on Monday that there would be no crash-out on WTO terms, because 'his deal includes the possibility of a no-deal exit'ù. Johnson is unlikely to remove the threat of a no-deal exit to Corbyn's satisfaction because the EU will not formally decide the length of the Brexit extension requested by the UK until early next week. During a meeting of EU diplomats, the French ambassador stood alone in arguing that it was not the right time to agree a three-month delay, in a move that will be welcomed in Downing Street. If the EU ultimately grants a three-month delay and Labour continues to refuse an election, Johnson might not be able to stop the withdrawal agreement being revived by backbenchers. The decision would rest with John Bercow, the Speaker, who could allow it to be 'unpaused'by MPs as one of his last acts after a decade in the chair. Labour MP Peter Kyle said he was in talks with ex-Tories about their next steps. Bringing the agreement back to parliament was 'one of the options on the shelf'and 'credible'ù. Kyle said they had done all the preparatory work for this scenario in the summer and were ready to go with such a parliamentary move if needed, but wanted to see what the government and Corbyn did in the next few days. He said he did not believe Johnson's threat that no Brexit legislation would be brought back to the Commons between now and Christmas, so backbenchers might not need to try and bring back the bill themselves but could amend his deal. Support for a second referendum 'ebbs and flows'ù, Kyle said, but that presently 'the tide is coming back on it'among MPs. Dominic Grieve, the former Tory who has led the battle against no-deal Brexit, said MPs bringing back the withdrawal bill with the aim of attaching a second referendum was 'within the field of options'ù, but any attempt by backbenchers to bring in primary legislation would be full of procedural hurdles. The legislation would need a money resolution moved by the government, though MPs could hope simply to show progress on finding a majority for any one Brexit option. Grieve said: 'Politics is the art of the possible and clearly it's been my argument for a long time that it would be desirable to have a second referendum and put the options available to the public to resolve the problems we have.'Others expressed scepticism that such a move would work. Nick Boles, a former Tory minister who voted for Johnson's deal, tweeted: 'There is no such plan. And it wouldn't work, as taking a bill of this scale into committee requires a money resolution and Queen's consent, which only the government can provide.'Last night Johnson was accused of misleading parliament and seeking to tear up provisions for workers' rights after Brexit.  According to the Financial Times, leaked documents indicated the UK government was willing to countenance divergence from EU standards on such rights, as well as other regulations, despite Brussels insisting that any future relationship be based on a level playing field. The shadow Brexit minister, Jenny Chapman, said: 'These documents confirm our worst fears. Boris Johnson's Brexit is a blueprint for a deregulated economy, which will see vital rights and protections torn up. 'It is also clear Boris Johnson was misleading parliament earlier this week. You simply can't trust a word Boris Johnson says. Under his proposals, this Conservative government has no intention of maintaining high standards after we leave the EU.'Even Conservative supporters of Johnson remained baffled on Friday by the prime minister's sudden U-turn on his Brexit deal earlier in the week, when he decided to pause it rather than allow more time to debate the legislation. One minister told the Guardian that the views among colleagues was 'No 10 has been churlish'ù, while a backbench MP said the strategy emerging from Downing Street was 'very confused'and 'out of control'ù. Keith Simpson, Conservative MP for Broadland, described the 'floundering in No 10 as worthy of Baldrick in Blackadder'ù, adding: 'The problem is that circumstances beyond [Johnson's] control and things he has done has made 31 October almost impossible and I think what he's decided to do - supported by most, but not all of the cabinet - of trying to have a vote on a general election looks as though it's part of the people versus parliament but I think it's quite a risky strategy.'",0,Neutral
The question for Labour: why are you sticking with Jeremy Corbyn?,-0.125,Negative,"In all this talk of early elections, of dates and delays, there is one common if, for some, uncomfortable premise. It is the constant factor in the calculus run by all the political parties and by the warring factions within them. Put simply, it is the fact that vast swathes of the electorate are unprecedentedly hostile to the idea of making Jeremy Corbyn their prime minister. The Labour leader has the lowest poll numbers of any leader of the opposition since records began. His net satisfaction rating is minus 60, outstripping the previous negative record held since 1982 by Michael Foot. He is less popular than Boris Johnson among both men and women, in every socioeconomic category, whether richer or poorer, in London and Scotland as well as the Midlands and Wales and, remarkably, in every age group. Perhaps it's no surprise that the over-65s prefer Johnson to Corbyn by 62% to 8%, but it's arresting that even among the youngest voters, aged 18 to 24, those once seen as the Labour leader's base, Corbyn is less popular than the prime minister, albeit by three points. Point this out, and the Labour leader's most unbending followers will insist that you can't believe opinion polls. Swiftly, they will remind you that Corbyn's poll numbers were dire back in the spring of 2017 too, only for Labour to surge by election day - though, of course, Labour still lost that contest. They believe that the lightning of 2017 will strike twice, that once 'Jeremy'has equal time on TV and is back on the campaign trail, the magic will happen all over again. Never mind that Theresa May was a truly awful candidate tied to a voter-repellent manifesto, and that Johnson will be a much wilier opponent. Or that whatever novelty and freshness Corbyn represented in 2017 will have faded this time round. Or that Corbyn is far more unpopular now than he was back then, when even at his lowest ebb his net satisfaction rating was a mere minus 41. Or that Labour benefited in 2017 from remainers lending their votes to the party to stop Brexit, a move not all of them will be willing to repeat. Never mind all that, the faith of the true believers is intact. And given how recent contests have turned out, both here and abroad, as well as the new multiparty landscape of British politics, only a fool would bet the farm on any outcome. Still, outside the circle of the devout, Labour's low ratings are currently accepted as a political fact on the basis of which important decisions are made. Take five paces back and that explains the current standoff over an election date. The Tories want an election because they believe that, as things stand, they have a good chance of winning it. Labour backbenchers are reluctant to have an election for the same reason: they think the Tories will win. One shadow cabinet member reckons that even if Labour were to whip its MPs to accede to Johnson's request for a mistletoe and holly election on 12 December, Labour MPs would vote against it. Why? 'Because turkeys don't vote for Christmas.'Those whose driving cause is stopping Brexit proceed on the same assumption as everyone else. Right now, the stalemate parliament - where Johnson can be thwarted on a timetable one day, forced into an extension the next - allows them to keep the dream alive. So long as the UK hasn't actually left the European Union, the remain cause lives to fight another day. But if Johnson forces an election and, as the polls suggest, wins it, then he'll be able to pass his Brexit deal comfortably. It will all be over. Some remainer MPs also make a good principled case for wanting to delay an election until after Brexit has been resolved by this current parliament. The problem with a general election, they say, is contained in the name: it's a general vote, about a range of issues, which means it can never provide definitive clarity on Brexit. Only a referendum on Johnson's deal v remain could do that. That logic is sound, but you'd be naive to think its advocates would be pushing it if Johnson were trailing, rather than leading, in the polls by double digits. It's worth stressing, remainers' nervousness about an early election is not because they fear they are on the losing side of the Brexit argument itself. On the contrary, remain has enjoyed an unbroken lead over leave in the polls since March 2018: the current average shows remain leading by - wouldn't you know it - 52% to 48%. The problem lies in how the forces of leave and the forces of remain will square up against each other in the next parliamentary election. Through his die-in-a-ditch antics, and his leadership of the 2016 Vote Leave campaign, Johnson may well unite most of the leave tribe behind him: Brexiters believe he's one of their own. But the anti-Brexit vote is divided, as many remainers reflect on the past three years of Labour triangulation on the issue, and Corbyn's own anti-EU history, and turn to the Lib Dems instead. Under Theresa May, the Tories faced a similar problem, haemorrhaging votes to Nigel Farage among Brexiters who considered May a closet remainer. They replaced May with Johnson and watched the Brexit party's numbers slide. Ask yourself, would the Lib Dems be enjoying their current poll revival if Labour were led by someone instantly and intuitively identifiable as a conviction remainer? Or would remain voters feel no need to decamp to Jo Swinson in that scenario, happily rallying behind Labour instead? To be concise, Johnson yearns for an election because the remain vote is divided - and that is because millions of remainers have looked at Corbyn's Labour and decided they need to look elsewhere. Yet the curious thing about British politics just now is that, among Labour supporters, this is barely mentioned in public. To raise it is to bring social media ordure down upon on your head, as if it were improper or even sacrilegious to speak of such things - even though it is truly extraordinary that the party of opposition is not 20 points ahead of a government in office for nine years, so bitterly divided it has expelled 21 of its own MPs, including two former chancellors, and which has failed to deliver on its central promise. Such a government should be bracing itself for a wipeout. Instead, blessed by a record-breakingly weak opposition, it is preparing to win another term. The diehards will say that to criticise Corbyn in this way is to side with the Tories against the poor and vulnerable. But the opposite is true. To stick with a path that makes five more years of Boris Johnson, and a hard Brexit, more likely is not to side with the poor and the vulnerable - it is to betray them.

David Miliband: Brexit is wrecking British democracy,-0.75,Negative,"Brexit has taken a wrecking ball to British democracy, with ministers counting on an outdated mandate to justify their decisions and the main parties in danger of turning into sects, former foreign secretary David Miliband has claimed.  In a lecture on Thursday night, Miliband cited the refusal of the chancellor, Sajid Javid, to produce an economic impact assessment of Boris Johnson's deal on the grounds that it must be passed because it is 'good for the fabric of our democracy'ù. He warned that Javid and his colleagues have been reduced to one central argument that 'Britain must press ahead with Brexit whatever the economic or political cost, because the danger to democratic health and confidence will be so great if we do not'ù. In the Martin Gilbert lecture, Miliband said: 'It cannot be more democratic to plough on with a version of Brexit that was never presented to the public in 2016 than to consult them on whether they want to go ahead with this plan.'He added: 'The risks to democratic health of no further consultation are greater than allowing the public to decide, especially so when the plan does not represent the end of Brexit but in fact is only the beginning. 'If we leave the EU we will be 'òdoing Brexit', negotiating the consequences of Brexit, making up for Brexit, filling in the gaps left by Brexit, for at least the duration of the next parliament and most likely well beyond.'And he said that he shudders 'at what those convinced that Brexit can be 'òdone' this week will come to think when they realise it is not'ù. On the same night that Boris Johnson that he would seek a general election on 12 December, Miliband argued that an election would be the wrong vehicle to settle the issue created by the 2016 referendum, an event he described as 'a rush job with no explanation of what Brexit meant'ù.  He argued that one reason many fear an election is because 'an early 20th-century class-based structure is struggling to cope with 21st-century demands of identity politics pressed on it by Brexit. 'The party system is based on the idea that broad-church parties can represent coalitions of interest,'he said. 'But when churches become sects, the system breaks down. The danger is now staring us in the face. It is one reason why many people fear the next election.' He argued that events had also shown that British democracy itself needs a reboot. The attempt to prorogue parliament was a 'near-miss event'for our democracy that should serve as a teachable moment, he said. Changes that should follow included the adoption of citizens assemblies, electoral reform, and a written constitution.  ",-0.75,Negative
Hammond at helm as former Tories torpedo PM's breakneck Brexit,-0.125,Negative,"Philip Hammond led a group of nine Tory independents in torpedoing Boris Johnson's plans to rush through his Brexit deal in three days, in a sign that they were unconvinced by a promise to give parliament a vote on stopping a crash-out in 2020. The group of independents, who had the whip withdrawn for voting to block a no-deal Brexit last month, were instrumental in the failure of Johnson's bid to accelerate his legislation on Tuesday night. Among the nine were four former cabinet ministers, Hammond, Rory Stewart, Dominic Grieve and Justine Greening, a former deputy chief whip, Anne Milton, and two former junior ministers, Richard Harrington and Guto Bebb. Their votes against the timetable showed they had not been won round by a last-minute concession by the justice secretary, Robert Buckland. Just before the vote, Buckland told MPs the bill would allow 'parliament to have its say on the merits of an extension period'in 2020 if no free trade agreement was in place by then. While this convinced David Gauke, the former justice secretary, and several others sceptical of the timetable, it was not enough to prevent another loss for the prime minister. In talks with Downing Street, Hammond had been pushing for an automatic extension to article 50 if no trade deal were to be in place but No 10 did not promise that, believing it would be unacceptable to hardline Eurosceptics. One of the nine former Tories, Antoinette Sandbach, told the Guardian: 'This is a complex and serious piece of legislation. Whilst I understand the PM's wish to get the legislation through, it is too complex and difficult to bounce it through in three days. 'I have signed amendments around environmental protections and if there is a 'òdemocratic event' I would support a confirmatory referendum amendment. I will continue to vote for the best interests of my constituents, which include a deal on which they should have a say.'Earlier, Stewart gave an impassioned speech to the Commons saying more time was needed for parliament to examine the bill. 'My big beg for this House is let's please in these very, very final stages do it properly,'he said. The former development secretary, who plans to run as an independent candidate to be London mayor, said there was 'every reason for Brexiteers to be enraged'due to delays to the UK's withdrawal from the EU. But he added: 'It's also really, really important that we think about the other half of the population and we have to think about how to do this legitimately.'He said the withdrawal agreement bill was a 'hell of a big document'and two-and-a-half days was not enough time. Ken Clarke, the father of the House and former chancellor, voted against the timetabling and then urged Johnson to reconsider his decision to 'pause'the legislation.  'I can't quite see the logic of pausing progress on the bill when the whole House is expecting the next two days to be spent on it,'he said. 'It would enable us to see how quickly the House is actually proceeding, what sort of time is being looked for, it may enable then, if people start filibustering, which I hope they won't, for the government to get a majority for a timetable motion if it came back which was a modest adjustment to the one he had, because I think three or four days more would certainly do it.'Some Eurosceptics suggested their votes against the bill would kill off any hopes still harboured by the independents of being readmitted to the party. Steve Baker, the leader of the European Research Group, referred to Hammond's seat in Surrey, saying: 'It feels like there will be a candidate selection in Runnymede shortly.'However, Johnson would be likely to need their votes in order to ultimately get his legislation through parliament, if he takes the decision to proceed with the bill and leave the EU later than 31 October rather than seek an election. Their main demands are likely to be firmer protections for environmental standards and guarantees that the UK cannot crash out of the EU on World Trade Organization terms at the end of the transition period in 2020. Of the rebels, only Clarke is backing an amendment that would give Johnson a mandate to negotiate a customs union. To deal with the issue of a 2020 crash-out, Nick Boles, a former Tory who backed the timetable, said he had tabled an amendment that would make a two-year extension to the transition period automatic if there were no trade deal in place by the end of next year. He said it 'would require the government to seek an extension to the transition to December 2022 unless MPs vote to the contrary '¶ essential to stop hardline ERG members forcing through a no-deal Brexit in December 2020'ù. Clause 30, among a series of contentious clauses identified in the 115-page bill , which MPs first saw on Monday evening, dictates that only ministers can seek a longer transition period, even though this must then be approved by parliament. Hilary Benn, the Labour MP who chairs the Brexit select committee, tweeted: 'What happens if the government doesn't propose an extension? Parliament would have no say and we would exit the transition period on 31 December 2020 even if a trade agreement hadn't been reached by then with the EU; ie no deal.'",-0.125,Negative
Don't buy the hype: Boris Johnson's Brexit deal did not win approval,0.25,Positive,"It's not over. For a few anxious, or jubilant - depending on which tribe you belong to - minutes between 7.15pm and 7.30pm, it seemed as if the Brexit saga might just be on the verge of resolution, after three and a half agonisingly long years. The House of Commons voted to allow Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement bill to advance to the next stage, a prize that had eluded Theresa May not once, not twice, but three times. What's more, MPs gave it a green light more emphatically than even the most ardent Brexiters had dared hope. While May had been crushed by triple-figure majorities, Johnson won his meaningful vote by 329 to 299 votes, a majority of 30. Put another way, and as if to reflect this divided nation through what have become the defining numbers of the Brexit era, he won by 52% to 48%. For a prime minister who lost his governing majority within days of reaching Downing Street, and who lost six of his first seven votes in the House, this tasted like a rare and substantial victory. All he had to do next was win approval for his accelerated timetable, one that would cram line-by-line scrutiny of a 110-page bill giving legal effect to a 585-page withdrawal agreement, into 48 hours. For a few fleeting, clammy-palmed moments, it seemed as if he might pull it off. The naysayers of the DUP remained in their seats. Did that mean they were they going to abstain, thereby handing Johnson a second win? It did not. They rose and walked through the no lobby, confirmation of their fury at a Tory prime minister who has done what he himself had said no Tory prime minister should ever do - agreeing to separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to such an extent that Northern Irish businesses will need to fill in customs forms to ship goods to their friends and cousins in England, Scotland and Wales. The result was defeat by 322 to 308 - all but 52-to-48 in reverse. Denied his fast track to approval, Johnson announced he was not pulling the bill - as he had threatened - but 'pausing'it, as he waited to hear how long an extension the EU would grant to the Hamlet nation across the channel, forever paralysed by indecision. Posing as a man whose determination would not be deflected, Johnson said that we would 'definitely be leaving the EU with this deal'ù. But note what he did not say: he dropped his customary reference to 'by October the 31st'ù. For all the talk of corpses in ditches, and 'do or die'ù, it was that promise that expired this evening. What does it mean? First, don't fall for the hype that says that parliament approved Johnson's deal. It did not. MPs simply voted for it to receive a second reading, some of them motivated by the desire not to endorse it but to amend it. As Labour's Gloria De Piero confessed, she voted yes, 'not because I support the deal but because I don't'ù. That 30-vote majority will include MPs who wanted to propose UK membership of a customs union, others keen on conditioning the deal on public support in a confirmatory referendum. Screen out the Tory spin: those MPs should not be counted as backers of the deal. As for the defeat on the timetable, that is the result of what now looks like a tactical misjudgment by the government. By making such a fetish of the 31 October deadline - arbitrarily imposed by Emmanuel Macron when Theresa May missed the last one - Johnson painted himself into a corner whereby even a delay of a few days looked like a humiliation. Both Jeremy Corbyn and Ken Clarke signalled that it might not need much more than a few extra days to undertake the necessary scrutiny - though Nikki da Costa, until recently Johnson's head of legislative affairs, had said it required at least four weeks - which is hardly that long to wait. Instead of taking that pragmatic course, Johnson felt compelled to call the whole thing to a halt. Why? The obvious explanation is that this gives the PM a pretext to grab what he really wants: an early election framed as a battle to get Brexit done, with him as the people's tribune pitted against those wicked remainer saboteurs. But another explanation suggests itself, too. Any period of scrutiny is unpalatable to Johnson, because he fears that the threadbare coalition that might exist to back his deal will unravel once it engages in closer examination of the withdrawal agreement. Its erosion of workers' rights; its creation of a new no-deal cliff edge in 2020; its entrenchment of a hard Brexit in law - all those dangers would only become more visible under the spotlight of protracted (or even normal) Commons scrutiny. Bits of his coalition - especially among those Labour MPs who backed him on Tuesday - would begin to flake off. The truth is, Johnson will never have a bigger vote for his deal in this House of Commons than the one he assembled tonight. It will only get smaller. No wonder he had to pause. His next option is to call an election - and gamble that the next parliament will be more forgiving than the last. Either way, we are not free of the Brexit saga yet, not by a long way.

We'll move on from the EU vote but we are now stuck in our tribe. Welcome to Brexitland'¶,0.5,Positive,"It seems as if the end is in sight. Four and a half years after voters chose it in a referendum, the process of taking Britain out of the European Union is drawing to a close. The final act may yet be calm or chaotic, but in any event at least politics will no longer be dominated by ill-tempered argument between the tribes of Leave and Remain. We can move on from the minutiae of fish quotas and customs declarations and get back to the bread-and-butter issues that really matter. Yet, while the formal Brexit process may end, Brexitland is here to stay. Brexit has mobilised deep divisions over identity and values that have been building in the electorate for many decades and these are not going away. The debate over EU membership has been so protracted and painful because it is about far more than Britain's relations with its European partners. Britain has been reshaped by mass immigration, rising ethnic diversity and an expansion of higher education. The EU referendum activated the new divides opened up by these changes, creating political identities - Remain and Leave - and banners for voters with different world views and priorities to rally behind. These Leaver and Remainer identities are now more widely shared, and intensely felt, than any other form of political attachment. The political fight is different because everyone knows whose side they are on and whom they oppose. We can see the conflict between the Brexit tribes creeping into issue after issue, even as Brexit itself falls down the political agenda. Leave and Remain tribes divide in their views of institutions, politicians and issues from higher education to environmentalism. The Brexit tribes divide even in their views of how to respond to the Covid-19 crisis. The divides recur because what Leave and Remain capture and symbolise are fundamental differences in voters' outlooks and priorities. Leave has become the identity of choice for voters more attached to traditional social identities and more anxious about rapid social change. Remain has become the badge of voters who embrace the growing openness and mobility of recent decades and are keen to accelerate it. These differences in outlook are differences in degree, not kind. All groups in British society have shifted in a liberal, inclusive direction. The socially conservative pensioner of 2020 is far more likely to be at ease with diversity or gay marriage than their parents or grandparents were. Large numbers of people just a generation ago were openly prejudiced against other races and quite happy to say so. Condemnation of racism today is near universal. Yet while everyone is shifting in the same direction, they are doing so at different rates. Most Leave voters condemn prejudice and discrimination as social ills, but they have a narrower understanding of what racism means and what are the best solutions to fight it. Most Remain voters are not woke puritans seeking to shut down legitimate opponents, but people strongly motivated by the cause of anti-racism, who can find it hard to understand others who do not share their expansive interpretation of this cause. This is the heart of the Brexitland conflict: a rapidly changing society throws up identity conflicts that require sensitivity and respect for shades of grey to work through, but the polarising politics of 'us against them'that Brexit has catalysed works against this. Partisans see the best in their own group and the worst in their rivals. It is all too tempting for a socially liberal Remainer to reach for stereotypes of ignorance and prejudice to dismiss a Leave voter. It is all too easy for a Brexiter to read a Remainer's anti-racist passion as the fashionable hypocrisy of the privileged. Partisan stereotypes are chronically available to all of us. They are part of how we make sense of a complex world. But they also have a strong polarising effect. It is easier to shout down our opponents than see things from their point of view. Politics all too often makes this worse. Tribal attacks and partisan stereotypes are temptations that political leaders and activists indulge eagerly when in a tight spot. Stoking outrage at the evils of the other tribe is an effective way to motivate supporters and distract attention from your own failings. We see no shortage of this behaviour every time a new identity conflict emerges. Demonising political opponents may deliver a short-term advantage, but in the long run it polarises politics further by keeping partisan stereotypes at the forefront of voters' minds. While identity conflicts look set to continue, they will be fought out on very different terrain once the issue of Brexit itself finally fades. While predicting the direction of politics is a fool's errand - few had heard of Covid-19 a year ago - a couple of issues loom large as potential flashpoints. The first is Scotland. A new Scottish parliament will be elected next May and the SNP will treat a strong performance as a mandate to begin the campaign for a new independence referendum. The SNP has made great gains by mobilising Scottish resentments against England and Westminster. It is quite possible that Boris Johnson's Conservatives will look to return the favour, mobilising English nationalist sentiment against Sturgeon's supporters. The risk, as with Brexit, is that once such resentments are mobilised they become hard to control. However, the next moment of mobilisation of identity conflicts does not have to come from the side of nationalist or traditionalist right. Although the years in the run-up to the referendum were dominated by the mobilisation of voters threatened by diversity and immigration, the next wave of identity conflicts could be sparked by liberals organising to accelerate change. The Black Lives Matter protests that gripped British cities in the spring could be a sign of things to come, as liberal voters press politicians to embrace and support changes they see as desirable. The past decade of Ukip, Donald Trump and Brexit has belonged to politicians who mobilised those most threatened by the changes reshaping our societies. The next decade may yet belong to those who give voice to the voters who embrace change. '¢ Robert Ford and Maria Sobolewska are professors of political science at the University of Manchester.

Johnson and Macron hold talks on coronavirus and Brexit,-0.125,Negative,"Boris Johnson has held Brexit telephone talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, as the clock ticks down to the deadline for a deal. The two leaders spoke on Saturday with seemingly just days remaining for an agreement on a future trade deal to be reached, after UK and EU negotiating teams met on Friday for what sources said was a positive meeting. With the negotiators, led by UK's David Frost and the EU's Michel Barnier, due to reengage on Monday, No 10 said the prime minister 'set out the latest state of play in the negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU'ù. The No 10 spokesperson added: '[Johnson] confirmed the UK's commitment to exploring every avenue to reach an agreement. He underlined that a deal was better for both sides, but also that the UK was prepared to end the transition period on Australia-style terms if an agreement could not be found. 'The prime minister emphasised that progress must be made in the coming days to bridge the significant gaps, notably in the areas of fisheries and the level playing field, through the process of intensive talks between chief negotiators agreed with the president of the European commission. The leaders agreed to keep in touch on the issue.'Johnson has suggested publicly that the EU summit in Brussels on Thursday is his deadline for a deal. He said in September that failure to reach an agreement would mean it was time to 'accept that and move on'ù. Frost reiterated the comments during a parliamentary hearing this week, but a senior EU diplomat said this was not Brussels's understanding following private discussions. 'I don't detect any readiness on the British side to suspend the negotiations,'the source told the Guardian on Friday. 'This is going to continue. It is not a deadline.'The talks are expected to go right up to Thursday afternoon when the 27 heads of state and government sit down. 'We need to get a little bit more from the UK side, or Michel Barnier needs to, before he is ready to use, as he says, the 'òsubmarine' or the 'òtunnel','the senior EU diplomat said. Both sides have said an agreement needs to be struck in October to ensure sufficient time for ratification. Johnson and Macron also discussed the coronavirus crisis in their bilateral discussions.

Italian PM urges UK to do right thing on Brexit deal,0,Neutral,"Italy's prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has urged the British government to come good on a Brexit deal but admitted it was currently 'difficult to feel optimistic'amid legal wrangling over the withdrawal agreement. 'Obviously the legislative move in the UK creates tension,'said Conte, referring to Boris Johnson's tabling of a bill that violates key elements of the agreement reached with Brussels last year. 'But beyond this step I believe there will be an agreement in the end '¶ and trust that the British government will be willing to reach one that ensures reciprocal advantages,'he said in an interview with the Guardian and five other European newspapers in Rome. Conte is under pressure from Italian exporters to ensure a favourable Brexit outcome amid fears that Johnson's move could jeopardise commercial relations with one of Italy's biggest markets. A law professor from Puglia, Conte arrived on the political scene in June 2018 after being plucked from obscurity to lead a coalition between the Five Star Movement (M5S) and Matteo Salvini's far-right League. That alliance collapsed in the summer of 2019 after Salvini's failed attempt to bring about snap elections. Conte had been expected to quietly step aside, but in what was the first indication of his growing confidence, he delivered a blistering attack against Salvini in parliament before carving out a new majority between M5S and the centre-left Democratic party. From a figure once derided as a 'puppet'between warring coalition partners, Conte is now immensely popular in Italy for the way he has so far handled the coronavirus pandemic. Italy, the first hit of the European countries, has the continent's highest death toll after the UK but has so far avoided the kind of sudden leap in infections since the summer seen elsewhere. Whether he manages to retain Italians' trust is very much hinged on his coalition's ability to transform the country's post-pandemic economy. Conte was praised, even by detractors, for managing to secure Italy the largest share - £209bn - of the European Recovery Fund after torturous negotiations in July. 'This government has an opportunity that no other government has had before,'Conte said. 'But with this great opportunity also comes great responsibility. This is why I said that if we fail [to deliver] it would be shameful, and we must be sent packing.'Developing infrastructure, including roads, railways, airports and ports, is on the agenda, as is pursuing 'ecological change'and investing in education and research. He also envisages a digitalised future for Italy. 'Imagine, there are those living in mountain villages who don't even have a phone connection.' He said: 'Austerity policies and public debt have penalised investment in human capital and made us less competitive. We must revolutionise. So many bright Italian graduates seek their fortune abroad, but we must provide them with a future here.'Conte won the hearts of many Italians during the early stages of the coronavirus emergency with his calm, assured and empathic messages. As he announced a national lockdown, he said: 'Let's remain distant today so we can hug with more warmth tomorrow.'The words made an impact. 'It was a message to Italian citizens calling them to make great sacrifices, but it was also a message of hope and confidence in the future,'he said in the interview. 'Deaths were increasing every day and this was very painful. We had to stay focused and ask for maximum cohesion of all citizens while trying to maintain a relationship of trust - this was fundamental.'Daily new cases rose to 3,678 on Wednesday, the highest since mid-April, just as the government made it obligatory to wear face masks outside. A state of emergency has been extended until the end of January, meaning Conte will continue to have the power to impose a lockdown and other safety measures without the approval of parliament. 'Behind the reality of the Italian epidemiological data there is no miracle, but the very hard efforts and sacrifices of the entire country, which allowed us to overcome the most acute phase of the pandemic and now allows us to face this new phase with a great sense of responsibility and attention,'Conte said. Praise for the country has brought no comfort to the families of victims driving an investigation by prosecutors in Bergamo, the northern province worst hit by the virus, into alleged errors by authorities at the beginning of the pandemic. Conte was questioned by prosecutors in June. More than 36,000 Italians have died from the virus. 'Whoever loses a loved one wants answers and judicial truth, and this is perfectly understandable,'Conte said. 'The prosecution summoned me as a person informed about the facts and if they do so again I would be willing to provide the facts I know. 'We are living in a situation that was unthinkable for all of us. Some accuse me of having done too much, of being a liberticide, while others accuse me of having done too little. I'm aware that before responding to public opinion or a judicial authority, I should respond to my conscience. And I say this humbly: I think I did everything possible to manage a really difficult situation.'",0.75,Positive
Boris Johnson's speech shows that even Brexit is beyond his comfort zone,-0.375,Negative,"The Conservative party is sometimes afraid of losing office, but never doubts its right to be in government. It draws resilience from a presumption that Tory rule is the country's default setting - the natural state from which other parties are a faddish deviation. Boris Johnson is the incarnation of that belief. He was carried to Downing Street by the conviction that it was his destiny, and by a charismatic way of making that idea contagious. But charisma is a spell not easily recast once broken. Mourning that misplaced magic was an undeclared theme of the prime minister's keynote speech today, delivered online to a virtual conference. Johnson made wistful references to the absence of an appreciative crowd. He also used his recovery from Covid-19 as a metaphor for national renewal after the pandemic, rejecting claims of enduring physical and, by implication, political debilitation. Leaders in possession of a 'mojo'do not have to declare it so explicitly. Passages in the speech that emphasised Johnson's attachment to private enterprise and abhorrence of an over-mighty state all sounded like reassurance to the faithful, suggesting a fear that faith is waning. Doubtless it would have worked in a packed auditorium, eliciting the ovations he craves. But it is early in the term to be seeking the solace of an activist comfort zone. In that respect, the more significant conference speech was delivered three days earlier - by Douglas Ross, the party's leader in Scotland. It did not get as much attention in England as it deserved, which proves the point that Ross was making. He warned against 'defeatism and disinterest'in the battle to save the union from nationalism. It was the speech of an opposition leader challenging his own side to snap out of complacency, which is unusual for a party that won a general election only 10 months ago. But the Tories did not win in Scotland and they will not win next May's Holyrood poll. The upper limit of Ross's ambition is to deprive the SNP of a majority. Viewed from that angle, it is plainly untrue that conservatism is the default setting for government in Britain. It isn't true in Wales either. Nor does it stack up in London, Manchester, Liverpool or any seat of government where Tories routinely sit in the minority. The centralised character of the British state and the tight media orbit around Westminster sustain a myth that the party with command of the Commons speaks for the country. People who do not see themselves reflected in that ruling party then become steadily alienated, and attach themselves to politics that rejects the centre for its remote arrogance. In Scotland, that dynamic is accelerated by aversion to a brand of posh English conceit, the pungent essence of which flows from Johnson. The Scottish Tory leader could not say aloud that the prime minister is more problem than solution. The point had to be contained in the wider observation that Westminster parochialism bolsters support for Scottish independence - supplying fresh grievance that Nicola Sturgeon uses to distract from her own failures in government. 'The case for separation is now being made more effectively in London than it ever could in Edinburgh,'Ross said. In private, Scottish Tories complain about wilful ignorance among English Conservative MPs, who too often see Scotland as implacably alien. (It does not help that their main exposure to Scottish political opinion comes from SNP contributions to Commons debates.) In some cases, impatience with Scottish nationalism shades into aggressive counter-nationalism: the view that devolution is a scam to siphon off money from English pockets to ungrateful Scots. The more common problem is the casual anglo-centrism that makes no effort to understand the contours of Scottish identity and has no vocabulary to describe its value as a component in British identity. Or, as Ross put it: 'They too often see Britishness and Englishness as one and the same.'That conflation suits Sturgeon, since it implies that true Scottishness can only be fulfilled in emancipation from rule by Westminster. Johnson doesn't want to be the prime minister who broke the union, but he has no idea how to mitigate the threat. If he did, he would not have loaded the internal market bill with free ammunition for nationalists. The draft law uses the repatriation of regulatory powers from Brussels as cover for a pan-British nation-building agenda: it fashions Brexit into a paddle for rowing against the tide of devolution. There is an essential legal requirement to harmonise UK market rules outside the EU, but it takes real ineptitude to do it in a way that reinforces core SNP complaints about English high-handedness, months before a Scottish election. Yet many Tories think it is a brilliant wheeze. The theory is that new centralised spending powers will be used to prove the union's value, as if 'made in the UK'branding on a bridge will clear the scales from pro-independence voters' eyes. That strategy would be crass at the best of times. It is wildly counterproductive when the propagandising scheme is smuggled into the same bill that Johnson is using to repudiate the Brexit withdrawal agreement, poisoning negotiations with Brussels. It enacts the perfect synthesis of Tory contempt for Scottish legal autonomy and pro-European sensibility. Conservative ministers say with a straight face that Brexit strengthens the union. They can hardly say the truth. One of the best arguments against Scottish independence is to note how much harder, more bitter and expensive it would be than the separation of Britain from the EU. The last four years are a terrible warning against such folly. That is not a line available to a party that has no problem with recklessly ripping up unions, as long as they are European. Johnson hardly mentioned Brexit in his speech. It is still a pressing issue for the country, but it is not his political comfort zone any more. He could not say much about his handling of the pandemic either, beyond complaining that it is all a bit of a drag and promising that it will one day be over. He wants to fast-forward beyond the difficult present to focus on a distant horizon - when problems for which he takes no responsibility are solved by a mysterious process for which he gets all the credit. That is not just a quirk of the prime minister's narcissistic personality. He holds his office thanks to the unique institutional self-confidence of the Conservative party: its unshakable sense of entitlement to power. That is a source of formidable strength '¶ right up until the point where it becomes a crippling weakness. It feeds the appetite for power that wins elections; and breeds the complacency that loses them. Such is the natural life cycle of Tory governments. Johnson is working through it at speed.

Rishi Sunak cannot become a statesman if he remains a Brexiter,0,Neutral,"A friend who has always shared my distrust of Boris Johnson said to me recently that he had at least hoped our prime minister would 'grow into the job'ù. Alas, as even former supporters - not least those who made the historic mistake of electing him leader - acknowledge, Johnson has not grown into the job. Day by day, he has grown out of it. Life for the prime minister has until recently been a series of japes. As PG Wodehouse wrote in Hot Water (which I recommend as splendid light relief from the daily horrors of Covid and Brexit): 'If it is true that the Hour produces the Man, it is also true that it remorselessly reveals the wash-out.'Governing a country is no jape. Johnson has already been found out, and his two most prominent cabinet colleagues, Rishi Sunak and Michael Gove, are what is known in the trade as 'on manoeuvres'ù. Gove, to my mind, is so steeped in the blood of Brexit - it was going to be painless, a doddle - that he has lost all credibility as a leadership rival. He now spends his time saying it is not going to be painless, least of all for those Brexit burghers of Kent who, remarkably, did not seem to realise that they would be in the frontline of the disruption to transport that will inevitably follow our leaving the single market, deal or nor deal. Sunak, by contrast, is flavour of the month with both the Tory party and a large section of the media. He is in a fascinating position: widely thought of as a rightwing chancellor who finds himself popular for what he is in theory opposed to: doling out public money - although even then he can't please everybody, and there are some rumblings of discontent. But then, as students of his career know, Sunak is what is known as a trader. (For younger readers I should emphasise that, in the old days, 'trading'referred to dealing in real goods and commodities, goods that mattered, not just in money.) The City of London, where Sunak earned his spurs, is good at trading in money, and a healthy financial sector is vital for the workings of the 'real'economy; unfortunately one of the many casualties of this pointless exercise in Brexit looks like being the pre-eminence of the City in European markets. Sunak is also a Brexiter. He has, we are told, been a Brexiter since the age of 18 - ie, since before the word Brexit was coined. I hope that at some stage, under the influence of his Treasury officials, he will come to his senses. Meanwhile, however, he has most of the economics profession on his side in taking the St Augustine approach to the public finances: budget balance, but not yet - and perhaps not for 30 years. If there is one thing that matters in the economy now it is employment. But it is no good warning the nation, as Sunak does, that unemployment is going to rise dramatically. The government must do even more about it than it is doing now. There are huge unused resources that need to be employed. Inflation is not the problem. Why, my old friend Gordon Brown, the chancellor who granted the Bank of England independence in setting interest rates, recently revised his original approach. He now favours the brief of the US Federal Reserve, in stipulating that 'maximum employment'should be given equal weight to control of inflation in the Bank's remit. And, after a recent chance meeting, I have the permission of yet another old friend, Mervyn (Lord) King, to quote him as saying we need fiscal expansion to get out of this depression, not talk of tax increases. This is the very same former governor of the Bank who, to my mind, made a serious error in advising the coalition government of 2010 onwards to embark on a policy of austerity when the economy was only just emerging from the horrors of the 2008 banking crisis. One item on the agenda that is not calculated to assist the British economy's emergence from the epidemic-enforced depression is - guess what - going ahead with Brexit.  A recent poll tells us that 50% of the population think Brexit is a mistake, and only 39% support it. I know democracies should not neglect the interests of minorities, but this is ridiculous.  The fact of the matter is that the Brexiters misled those who voted with them when saying how easy it would be. However, people can be stubborn and reluctant to admit that they might have been wrong. But back to our current prime minister. When he regards his chancellor, he probably alters that famous quote from Julius Caesar, and thinks to himself: 'Yond Sunak has a lean and hungry look.'To my mind, Sunak will rank as a statesman only if he acknowledges that Brexit is a mistake of historic proportions, and every effort should be made to contain the damage.

The Guardian view on Johnson and devolution: another reckless gamble,0.375,Positive,"The internal market bill has passed the House of Commons; a Tory rebellion over clauses repudiating the Brexit withdrawal agreement came to nothing. The damage to Britain's international reputation is done. But another hazard, potentially even more consequential, lurks in the proposed law as it relates to devolved matters reaching far beyond customs checks at Irish Sea ports. Many English MPs seem oblivious to the problem. Their Scottish and Welsh counterparts are not. The Holyrood parliament and Senedd in Cardiff are sure to withhold support for the bill. (The Northern Ireland assembly has already passed a motion rejecting it.) Boris Johnson will not defer to the Sewel convention, the non-binding protocol that requires motions of consent in the devolved legislatures. He has no record of honouring constitutional principle. But failure to engage with Welsh and Scottish concerns risks destabilising, possibly fracturing, the union. It abets nationalists who argue that Brexit is being used as cover for a Westminster power grab. The dispute involves the 'repatriation'of rules that were harmonised by EU membership. The Downing Street view is that fair commerce across the country requires a single regulatory framework. Future trade deals will have to be signed on the basis that access to one part of the UK gives unfettered access to the whole. It would not be practical to let devolved governments erect internal regulatory barriers. But viewed from Scotland and Wales, the bill has a hidden agenda beyond the level playing field for trade. It grants new spending powers that reach across existing devolved competences. One of the government's stated objectives is the reinforcement of 'shared values'across the UK, which implies a project to bolster unionism and challenge nationalism, especially in Scotland. Unionists recognise that the idea of shared enterprise between England and Scotland needs rehabilitation. But that purpose is not served by smuggling the intent in a bill that purports to be about something else, nor by using the urgency of Brexit to evade scrutiny. Such tactics will be counterproductive. When applying its unitary regulations across the UK, the internal market bill does not preserve non-economic exemptions (for the protection of public safety and heritage, for example) that are written into EU law. Outside the EU, Scotland and Wales will end up being more tightly bound to rules written in Westminster than Britain as a whole was bound to rules written in Brussels. That might seem perfectly natural to Mr Johnson, who sees the reclamation of national sovereignty in pan-UK terms. Scottish and Welsh voters will smell hypocrisy. Establishing a post-Brexit internal market for the UK was always going to require substantial changes to the letter of the law pertaining to Scottish and Welsh government. It did not have to trample the spirit of devolution. Nationalists were always bound to cry foul, but that is a reason for Downing Street to tread judiciously and legislate deftly. Instead, Mr Johnson has been lavish in supplying enemies of the union with political ammunition. It is now the task of the Lords to distinguish what is practical and necessary in the internal market bill from those aspects that are reckless and harmful to the integrity of the UK. ",0,Neutral
The Trump-Biden debate revealed the dangers of Britain's 'special relationship',0,Neutral,"Ever since the pioneering Kennedy-Nixon encounter in 1960, the questions that political journalists pose after US presidential debates have been the same. Who performed best? Who had the better of this or that part of the argument? Who exceeded expectations or fell short? Who had the best lines and delivered the best zinger? And has any of it changed the election odds? They are still being asked after the first televised match-up between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. With five weeks to go before the US votes, the questions still matter. But after Tuesday's verbal roughhouse they also feel crowded out by other uncertainties that seem more epochal, more dystopian and more pressing, not least when seen from this side of the Atlantic. It can seem overblown, but it now makes sense to ask if America is on the edge of becoming ungovernable, or if the rule of impartial law enforcement still commands respect. It is also possible, in ways that were not true in the past, to consider whether the US can be relied on internationally, and whether it is realistic to continue to regard it as an ally. But if it is not an ally, what follows from that? The answers are increasingly uncomfortable. Perhaps most potently, it has to be asked whether America, with all its fabulous energy, wealth, liberty and ambition, still offers the inspirational model to the world that it did to so many, for so long. Or instead is today's America, defined increasingly by its inequalities, violence, fundamentalism and racism, becoming a model to be rejected, to be guarded against and even, in some cases, to be resisted? Sober answers to these questions matter to the whole planet, above all because of climate change and amid the coronavirus pandemic. But they matter to Britain in very particular ways too. The UK's claim to a special relationship with the United States has been the cornerstone of its view of itself in the world ever since 1945. A deference to, and infatuation with, America also runs deep in our culture. But if the US is changing in an increasingly dangerous fashion, where does that leave that foreign policy or that infatuation? Britain has a lot riding on getting the answer right. Coming at precisely the time when the UK is casting off its alliance with its own continent, the issue has special urgency. Back in 2016, when Britain voted to leave the European Union, the allure of the exit for many leavers rested partly on the apparent dependability of the transatlantic alliance. But that was pre-Trump. America is a different place and becoming more so. Even leavers should sometimes ask what exactly this wheel of fire is on to which they are binding themselves. Fundamentally, the credibility of any alliance, whether with Europe, the US or anyone else, rests on material self-interest over things such as trade and security. But these material issues are also oiled by common values and trust, without which the relationship remains brittle and pragmatic. The bigger ally will always call the shots. And Britain is not the bigger ally. Few of these values matter as much as respect for the rule of law. It is not difficult to list ways in which this has been undermined by Trump's America. The list would include everything from the president's tax returns to breaches of international treaties. The danger for Britain is that, in defence of its unequal alliance, it is beginning to follow the US down the same route of playing fast and loose with the law for political reasons. Take one hugely significant example. Trump and the Republican senate leadership are trying to install the conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett in place of the liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the US supreme court before the presidential election on 3 November. This is a wholly political act. But it is not new. It is merely a particularly shameless step in a long history of politically shaped justice in the US. In the long term, the Barrett nomination is aimed at creating a conservative 6-3 majority in the court, which may then start to undo abortion and other civil rights. But the overriding and immediate purpose is to construct a court that may rule on the result of the November election itself. If that were to happen, and if the court awarded the disputed election to Trump, the politicisation of American justice would be complete. In Britain, judges are still selected on the basis of their legal qualifications, not their politics. Even if you know the identity of the current UK supreme court president, which most people will not, it is a fair bet that you don't know whether Lord Reed can be classified as a liberal jurist or a conservative one. We are better off as a country for that. Judges should neither be cult figures, as Ginsburg became for some American liberals; or hate figures, as she was for conservatives. Seen against the backdrop of a divided America facing the Barrett nomination, Britain's institutions may still seem gratifyingly independent and resilient. But for how long? The Johnson government's purge of senior civil servants, and its plan to install conservative ideologues to govern the BBC and the independent regulators, are a declaration of war on pluralism and independence. If the United States continues its slide into culture wars and worse, the task of stopping this from dragging Britain down too will become increasingly urgent.

"Brexit: UK risks being flooded with cheaply produced food, EU warns",-0.25,Negative,"The UK will be flooded with cheaply produced food should it lower its regulatory standards after Brexit, Brussels has warned, echoing a new animal and child welfare campaign backed by the celebrity chef Jamie Oliver. On the eve of a crunch round of negotiations in Brussels over the UK's future trade and security relationship with the EU, the European council president, Charles Michel, said Boris Johnson's government faced a major choice with just three months left of the transition period in which the UK remains in the single market. In a speech in which he spoke of the UK facing the EU's 'quiet strength'over the four years of talks, Michel, a former prime minister of Belgium, claimed that 'the British face a dilemma'over whether to move away from European standards. 'What model of society do they want?'Michel asked. 'Do they prefer to maintain high quality standards - health, food, environmental - or, on the contrary, do they want lower standards, [to] subject their farmers and their competitors to unfair and unjust competition from other regions of the world? It is the answer to this question that will determine the level of access to our internal market.'On Sunday, a group of celebrities, including Oliver, the lifestyle coach Joe Wicks, BBC Countryfile presenter Anita Rani and chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, with the backing of the RSPB and RSPCA, launched a campaign demanding assurances that 'lower-standard'meat, such as US-produced chlorinated chicken or hormone-fed beef, will not be sold in British shops or served in restaurants and workplaces once the UK has left the EU. The alliance claimed the coronavirus pandemic had 'raised the stakes'because 'now, more than ever, we need to make sure everyone has access to affordable, good quality and sustainable food to help people be healthier, happier and more resilient'ù. The UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, and his team will renew negotiations with the EU side led by Michel Barnier on Tuesday, with the issue of a so-called 'level playing field'in food, environmental and work standards for both European and British businesses high on the agenda. The EU is seeking assurances not only of 'non-regression'from current standards but for there to be a mechanism for both sides to raise them in tandem in the future. British negotiators have rejected any clauses that tie the hands of the government. The most contentious issue in this strand of the negotiation is the issue of how the UK will control domestic subsidies in the future. In recent days, there have been reports of renewed optimism in Downing Street that a solution on both these issues, and that of EU access to British fishing waters, can be found in time to avoid a no-deal exit from the transition period. But government sources on Monday described such reports as 'on the enthusiastic side'ù. The prime minister's spokesman said: 'Although the last two weeks of informal talks have been relatively positive, there remains much to be done. The fundamentals of our position have not changed from the start of this process. 'We continue to be asked to accept provisions which do not reflect the reality of our status as an independent country.'Johnson has previously said that an EU leaders summit on 15 October is his deadline for a deal, after which the UK would focus on no-deal preparations. The spokesman appeared to backtrack from that position on Monday, describing it merely as a 'timetable we need to work to'ù. Brussels believes the real deadline for a deal to be struck to allow time for ratification is the end of October or first week of November. Meanwhile, on Monday the EU appeared to soften its own deadline for when the UK government must withdraw the contentious clauses in the internal market bill which would lead to a breach of international law. Maro≈° ≈†efƒçoviƒç, the European commission's vice-president, had previously said the UK needed to dump the problematic clauses by this Wednesday but, following a morning meeting with Michael Gove, his co-chair of the EU-UK joint committee on implementation of the withdrawal agreement, he appeared to concede that the EU was willing to bide its time. 'We are going to proceed with the negotiations,'he said. 'We are going to use every single minute.'While ≈†efƒçoviƒç did not spell out what would happen to trade and security talks if the UK did not back down, EU sources were more frank. 'There is no way that as long as this threat is pending that we agree to that finalised [trade and security] deal.'",0,Neutral
Women are taught from childhood not to offend. It's still holding us back,0,Neutral,"There is something curiously powerful about a woman who doesn't need to be liked. To watch Theresa May let rip in parliament this week - denouncing her successor's casual willingness to break international law, with an authority that can come only from having confronted very similar choices - was to realise the advantages conferred by no longer craving other people's approval. That she chose to remain in parliament at all is testament to her particular brand of imperviousness. Given the humiliations heaped upon her by her own party during her time in office, she might have been particularly tempted to crawl off and lick her wounds rather than stick around as a jobbing backbench MP. But May does not seem troubled by that kind of pride. She won't be remotely bothered if she is cold-shouldered by old colleagues for making life difficult for her party; it's not, to be blunt, as if she had many friends on the backbenches to lose. And I doubt she was denouncing Boris Johnson for the sake of a flattering headline, having always approached the media with the enthusiasm of a cat on a trip to the vet. Unusually for a politician, she has sought to be taken seriously throughout her career but not to be loved. It was a weakness in some ways, since elections are popularity contests in which people who can't, or won't, try to make people like them generally fare badly. But out of power, and in wider life - my God, it must be liberating. Women's endless desire to please is part of what makes the world go round. It drives us to run around after our children, partners, friends and our own parents; it's what makes us volunteer for good causes, perhaps what makes us even more likely to obey Covid restrictions, since that is at root about being seen to care for other people. But the fear of getting it wrong does rather less good, perhaps, for women individually. 'Forget about likability,'the author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie told younger female writers in a speech to an awards ceremony a few years ago which promptly went viral. 'If you start thinking about being likable you are not going to tell your story honestly, because you are going to be so concerned with not offending, and that's going to ruin your story.'It's not only women who twist themselves out of shape because they can't bear the idea of not being liked, of course. Time and time again, Johnson has muddled the government's coronavirus message because he can't quite bring himself to say something he knows people are going to hate without injecting a note of false hope. Yes, things are bad, but we'll send the virus packing in 12 weeks. Never mind, it will all be over by Christmas! Well, spring. Or maybe summer. Just as soon as the moonshot pays off, anyway. He is a needier leader than May ever was. Yet not wishing to offend, to upset, to say anything that might have you rejected by your peer group, is more often a habit ingrained in women from childhood. I spent much of last week interviewing older women about growing older and going through menopause, and time after time they talked about the relief of no longer worrying about what people think of them. But it had taken half a lifetime to get there. Wanting to be lovable inhibits women from expressing opinions that other people might not like - especially online, where to be female and have forthright views on anything is to invite derision from a certain kind of man - and sometimes from expressing opinions at all, in a climate where everything is polarised, and someone will reliably hate whatever you say. It ties us up in knots at work, where to be successful is not always the same as to be popular. It makes us bend over backwards to accommodate others, which is a fine thing until the point it leaves us with no room to breathe ourselves. It holds us back in relationships where, as younger women especially, we nod and smile and pretend to hang on the every word of men who palpably don't know what they're talking about; for to argue back is to be judged prickly, shrill, exhausting, even (perhaps especially) if you are right. There is a telling passage in Sasha Swire's now notorious Diary of an MP's Wife when, over yet another of those endless kitchen suppers chez her good friends David and Samantha Cameron, at which everyone apparently eats caviar while discussing how to stop Brexit, she goes uncharacteristically quiet. Her MP husband, Hugo, has asked her to keep her awkwardly pro-leave views to herself around the Camerons and, she writes: 'I comply, as I'm not one to let off fireworks these days; I'm too old and unsexy to carry it off.'She didn't want to be dismissed as a battleaxe, no longer fun at parties. Although maybe even Swire had enough of worrying about that in the end, given her diary positively screams from the rooftops every unspeakable thought she's ever had. Yet arguments, and the willingness to risk being thought unlikable for having them, can sometimes be the only means by which we progress. As the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg put it, when asked why she was so often the lone voice on the US supreme court stubbornly disagreeing with the rest: 'Dissent speaks to a future age.'It was never about being difficult for the sake of it, but about hoping that today's minority view would eventually become tomorrow's mainstream wisdom; not about being liked at the time, but about being acknowledged in retrospect, however grudgingly, to have been right.

"No-deal Brexit will cost UK more than Covid, report finds",0,Neutral,"The economic cost of a no-deal Brexit could be two or three times as bad as the impact of Covid, a report has concluded. Analysis by the London School of Economics and UK in a Changing Europe says 'a no-deal Brexit would represent a further major shock to a UK economy'with a 'major set of changes'to the economic relationship with the country's largest trading partner. 'Our modelling with LSE of the impact of a no-deal Brexit suggests that the total cost to the UK economy over the longer term will be two to three times as large as that implied by the Bank of England's forecast for the impact of Covid-19,'says the report. LSE modelling puts the long-term economic hit from a no-deal Brexit at 8% of GDP, similar to that of the government's own forecast in 2018 of 7.6%, which amounts to £160bn in today's money, or £2,400 per person. This compares with the Bank of England's latest forecast of the impact of Covid which shows a reduction of 1.7% of GDP to the economy up to 2022. This amounts to £40bn, or £600 per person, and is dwarfed by cost of a no-deal Brexit, which will have an impact on GDP for years to come. 'In the long run, Brexit is likely to be more significant'depressing the country's economic output over 20 years, says the report, titled 'What would no deal mean? In the short term it is 'almost certainly correct'that 'the economic impacts of Covid-19 dwarf those of Brexit,'it says, as not even the most pessimistic forecasts suggest the initial fall in output caused by a no-deal could lead to a downturn like that seen in the second quarter of this year. But it concludes that there will be longer term damage to the country's reputation for ease of doing businesses, with delays due to administrative burdens at ports, constraints on travel and tourism, as well as curbs on immigration and free movement of labour. This is on top of the impact of the imposition of tariffs such as 10% on cars and 50% on cheddar cheese imports, which would be imposed for at least one year until the UK came up with its own tariff arrangements with trading partners including the EU. Economists have talked of V-shaped, W-shaped and K-shaped recoveries from Covid, but a no-deal Brexit will make it 'harder for the UK to 'ògrow its way out of trouble','the report says. The authors of the report say the risk is that 'EU-based businesses will seek to avoid exposing themselves to UK suppliers, and that multinationals will seek to minimise the degree to which trade crosses the new border'ù. They add that the deal being discussed is low on ambition and 'relatively thin'ù, leading to its conclusion that this will not be the end of discussions with the EU. 'No deal or the thin deal on offer are both likely to be unsustainable endpoints,'they say. ",-0.625,Negative
Why Boris Johnson is constantly surprised when his government fails,-0.25,Negative,"When Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner published their much-discussed book, Superforecasting, one admiring reviewer thought it contained essential lessons for governing. He wrote: 'Forecasts have been fundamental to mankind's journey from a small tribe on the African savannah to a species that can sling objects across the solar system with extreme precision. In physics, we developed models that are extremely accurate across vastly different scales from the sub-atomic to the visible universe. In politics, we bumbled along making the same sort of errors repeatedly.'Presumably in the hope of improving the government's powers of prediction, Dominic Cummings, for he was that reviewer, put Superforecasting on the summer reading list that he issued to ministerial advisers. Alas, it does not appear to have enhanced the ability of the prime minister, his visually challenged colleague or anyone else in this government to see into the future. These are members of a regime that struggles to see into next week. They are particularly terrible at forecasting the consequences of their own actions. The expression on the face of Number 10 is that of a man who never looks where he is going and is then constantly surprised to find that he has stepped in dog excrement. There is an ever lengthening list of things that they could be reasonably expected to have anticipated and yet didn't. They did not foresee that using an algorithm to depress the A-level grades of thousands of young people would distress them and dismay their parents. They did not foresee that a campaign fronted by an eloquent football star to extend the provision of free school meals would strike a chord with the public. They did not foresee that applying a surcharge to foreign-born workers staffing the NHS would cause a massive backlash.  Multiple debacles, rebellions and reverses have even some of those who were once Boris Johnson's most fervent cheerleaders in despair. This persistent blundering has flowed from a fundamental inability to read the public mood or get on top of events. Throughout the coronavirus crisis, the government has been constantly behind the curve. How did Mr Cummings put it? 'We bumble along making the same sort of errors repeatedly.'They are no better in their specialist subject of Brexit. When Mr Johnson signed the withdrawal agreement with the EU that he sold to the British public as 'fantastic'ù, he failed to foresee that he would soon afterwards describe the agreement as so dreadful that he would have to threaten to break it. When he made the declaration that he was ready to violate international law, he failed to foresee that this would trigger condemnation from every living former prime minister and many senior Brexiters. In normal times, this inability to anticipate the consequences of its own decisions would be an embarrassing trait in a government. In the context of the Covid catastrophe, it is a deadly characteristic. When infection rates were surging across Europe at the outset of the pandemic, ministers did not foresee that it would be folly to allow race meetings and football matches to carry on as normal. Among other things they did not foresee was the fatal consequences of decanting elderly patients from hospitals into care homes without first checking whether they were free of the virus.  Seven months into the pandemic, and with alarming signs of a swelling second wave, some have learned from the benefit of experience. Scientists have a better understanding of the virus and doctors have improved their methods of treatment. Yet the government's skills of prognostication are not showing a matching degree of improvement. As the number of hospitalisations accelerates upwards, roughly doubling every eight days, it has again been found wanting in relation to testing for infection. There is particular anger among MPs and those they represent in virus hotspots, where it is particularly vital that testing happens rapidly, that people are being told there are no appointments available or that they will have to travel hundreds of miles to get a swab. In response to the outcry, Dido Harding, the Johnson-appointed head of the testing effort in England, tried to argue that the system is the victim of an unanticipated surge in demand. Not so. This spike was both predictable and predicted. Since the early summer, the government has been urging people to return to the office and bring 'bustle'back to high streets. Many Britons have been travelling around the country or holidaying abroad. The reopening of schools has brought the usual seasonal spread of start-of-term coughs and sniffles. You didn't need to be the world's smartest epidemiologist to anticipate that a large expansion of social contact would increase the potential vectors of infection for disease. And that, in turn, would lead to a surge in demand for tests. Sometimes ministers have foolishly implied that the public is at fault for putting too much stress on the system. It is true that there are people without symptoms seeking tests because a family member or workmate may have contracted the virus. It is entirely natural that people will take a precautionary approach. 'Play it safe'has been the thrust of government advice for months. That has been accompanied by repeated ministerial exhortations to remember that the disease can often be asymptomatic, especially among younger people. Public expectation that the system would have the capacity to provide a test to anyone who wanted one has been further fuelled by the constant prime ministerial hyperbole that the government is building a 'world-beating'system. In mid-July, Matt Hancock implied universal availability by urging people to get tested if they had 'any doubt'about being infected. Now the health secretary plans to ration access. The testing chaos, coming in the wake of so many other fiascos, has the Tory press beginning to wonder whether Mr Johnson is fit to be in Number 10. 'WHY ARE THEY STILL FAILING THE TEST?'demands the Daily Mail. 'Losing Track'and 'Johnson Adrift'were the lead editorials on successive days in the Times. The cover headline of the most recent edition of the Spectator, which is usually very friendly to its former editor, asks 'Where's Boris?'and is accompanied by a cartoon depicting him alone in an oarless boat on a heaving sea.  This echoes the wail of Tory backbenchers that the prime minister needs to 'get a grip'and 'rediscover his mojo'and 'give us a sense of direction'ù. The implication is that the remedy for a wretched performance is for Mr Johnson to impose more of his personality on the government. This has it precisely the wrong way round. His character is the central source of the repeated inability to anticipate and address challenges. All governments absorb the character traits of the person at the top. The person at the top of this government doesn't think through the consequences of his actions, is cavalier about detail and bored by complexity, prefers the quick hit of a snappy populist slogan to the steady slog of competent administration. All this was known about him long before the Tory party made him its leader. His flaws as a prime minister are a revelation only to those who wilfully ignored his biography and his record. He has spent a career living for today and letting tomorrow take care of itself. Colleagues and ex-wives can testify to his compulsion for over-promising and then under-delivering. He has been a gusher of dramatic and bogus predictions of what his government will achieve - 'a moonshot'this, a 'game-changing'that - because spouting wildly boosterish claims is so much easier than getting stuff done.  Funnily enough, the book Superforecasting identifies one of the core reasons why this government is failing. 'The worst forecasters were those with great self-confidence who stuck to their big ideas,'wrote Mr Cummings himself. They are lousy at understanding the world and coming to good judgments about it. 'The more successful were those who were cautious, humble, numerate, actively open-minded, looked at many points of view.'Now, which is a better description of the Johnson-Cummings method of government? 'Cautious, humble, numerate, actively open-minded, looked at many points of view'ù? That doesn't sound like them at all. 'Great self-confidence'ù, which leaves them stubbornly wedded to their 'big ideas'ù? That's much more like it. Their biggest idea of the moment is that leaving the EU's single market without a deal would be fine even in a double-whammy combination with a re-escalation of the coronavirus crisis. Bear in mind his previous record as a soothsayer when the prime minister confidently predicts that a crash-out Brexit would be a 'good outcome'ù. I hazard a guess that this is his most calamitously wrong forecast of all. '¢ Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer ",0,Neutral
"The Guardian view on Boris Johnson, Brexit and the law: wilful incompetence",0,Neutral,"To outside observers of Boris Johnson's government, it can be difficult to tell the difference between partisan provocation and rank incompetence. Both generate an aura of chaos. It does not help that members of Mr Johnson's own cabinet also struggle to understand what is going on. On a question as vital as the UK's willingness to observe international law, there is confusion at the highest levels. Earlier this week, the Conservative frontbench voted for the internal market bill that repudiates aspects of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, thus reneging on a ratified treaty. Ministers who worry that they are breaking international law comfort themselves that the breach is insubstantial. It is only 'limited and specific'ù, or so Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, told the Commons. In parliament's upper chamber, Lord Keen, advocate general for Scotland, was palpably uncomfortable with that caveated admission of unlawfulness. He suggested that it did not represent the official government position. But it did. Mr Lewis confirmed that he had been reading from a Downing Street script; Lord Keen, whose qualms had earlier been revealed in confidential advice seen by the Guardian, resigned on Wednesday. Other lawyers with ministerial portfolios have found their own ways to resolve the tension between the oaths they took as legal professionals and fealty to Mr Johnson. Robert Buckland, the justice secretary and a barrister, has said that he would withdraw his support for a bill if it broke the law in a way that 'cannot be judged finely or fudged'ù. That made it sound as if he is holding out for the government to perpetrate a more egregious offence before fully examining his conscience. Suella Braverman, the attorney general, justifies the bill's controversial clauses in terms that blend quasi-legal spin with political expedience. The EU has not been acting in good faith, she says. And parliament is supreme, especially 'in the difficult and highly exceptional circumstances in which we find ourselves'ù. In other words, the government should be free to do what it likes because it does not like what the EU has been doing. In reality, the bad faith is on the British side. Those 'difficult circumstances'arise from Mr Johnson's failure to secure a deal on his preferred terms. He is rejecting the withdrawal agreement out of frustration and panic. He hopes the ensuing crisis will change the dynamic in the negotiations, prodding the EU into concessions. If not, it sets him up for a rhetorical attack on Brussels as the aggressor. He wants an impossible deal or to blame foreigners for withholding it. That tactic contains two miscalculations. First, Brussels has not taken the bait. EU leaders are not supplying lurid condemnation to feed Mr Johnson's narrative of grievance. They will wait patiently at the negotiating table. If the UK ends up without a deal, it will be Mr Johnson's choice. Second, the Tory party is not so in thrall to their leader as to casually forget the law. Senior figures, including two former prime ministers, have criticised the bill. Backbench MPs demanded dilution of its most aggressive provisions. Mr Johnson, seeing that he had pushed his luck, agreed. But it is doubtful that even an amended version of the offending clauses would repair the harm done to Britain's reputation as a trustworthy negotiating partner. That does not bother a prime minister who is mostly interested in the domestic political dividend available from striking defiant anti-Brussels poses. Such flagrant disregard for international opinion compounds the damage. Downing Street attempted a controlled detonation of the Brexit process to advance the UK's position and achieved the opposite. In this case, there is no distinction to be made between provocation and incompetence. Mr Johnson's EU policy is a nasty cocktail of both. ",-1.5,Negative
Brexit: Johnson seeks to calm MPs before next showdown over bill,-0.125,Negative,"Boris Johnson has privately sought to calm angry MPs who plan to back an amendment to dilute his bill that unpicks the EU withdrawal agreement. His intervention raises expectations that the government will do a deal with backbenchers at a parliamentary showdown next week. More Conservative MPs have said they could join a rebellion against the government to block a breach of international law, unless an agreement is reached. However, the Guardian understands Johnson has spoken to a number of key MPs behind an amendment that would put a 'parliamentary lock'on using the controversial powers in the internal market bill and given reassurances that a deal can be done over the clauses that override parts of the withdrawal agreement. The PM is said to have privately conceded to MPs who spoke to him on Monday night that the admission by Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, that the bill broke international law had been the wrong tactic. A source close to Lewis said his statement that the powers in the bill breached international law had not been an error - but was an agreed 'direct answer'which had been signed off by Number 10 and government lawyers. A change in tone was also seen in the House of Lords, where the advocate-general Lord Keen said it was his view that the powers were lawful. However friends of Lewis pointed out that Keen was among those who agreed with the government's legal statement last week, which said the opposite. Several MPs said they now expected the government to give assurances when the amendment from Conservative MP Bob Neill comes back to the House of Commons would persuade them to back the government. It is thought those concessions could come at the debate or after the bill comes back from the Lords if peers amend the legislation. 'I think the government is eventually going to get its way on this,'one senior rebel MP said. 'There will be a deal.'Although the UK internal market bill passed with a comfortable 77 majority at its second reading, the focus in Westminster is next week's vote on the  Neill amendment. At present, controversial measures in the bill would hand unilateral powers to ministers in key areas yet to be agreed with the EU, breaching the terms of the treaty agreed in January. Neill's amendment would ensure the powers in the bill that breached the Northern Ireland protocol would not be used until there was another specific vote in parliament to use them, as a last resort. Should no deal be reached with the government, supporters of Neill's amendment believe there may be a number of MPs who, having voted with the government on Monday as a way of demonstrating support for its purpose but uncomfortable breaking international law, could be persuaded to back the amendment. Andrew Mitchell, the former international development secretary, told the house he was content to let the bill pass to second reading but would not then vote to pass a bill into law that would break an international treaty. 'I do not believe I have ever gone into a lobby to vote in a way that I knew was wrong, and I will not be doing it on this occasion either,'he said. One MP said they agreed with '95% of the bill'and wanted to see it pass to second reading. 'But I am uncomfortable with the three clauses and I will see what happens this week.'A number of MPs who abstained still believe Neill's amendment does not go far enough. 'These are pernicious clauses and I'd rather see them out of the bill altogether,'said one prominent rebel. 'I may be prepared to go further if there was a viable option to do so.'The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, whom one source said was 'wobbly'over parts of the bill, is due to address restive MPs at a meeting of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers on Wednesday evening. The list of Conservative MPs who deliberately abstained on the internal market bill is now known to be at least 20, including two former Northern Ireland secretaries - Karen Bradley and Julian Smith. Other senior Conservatives who abstained include two former attorney generals, Geoffrey Cox and Jeremy Wright, the former chancellor Sajid Javid, the vice-chair of the 1922 Committee, Charles Walker, and a number of other select committee chairs, including Simon Hoare and Tobias Ellwood. The internal market bill aims to enforce compatible rules and regulations regarding trade in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some rules, for example around food safety or air quality,† which were formerly set by EU agreements, will now be controlled by the devolved administrations or Westminster. The internal market bill insists that devolved administrations† have to accept goods and services from all the nations of the UK - even if their standards differ locally. This, says the government, is in part to ensure international traders have access to the UK as a whole, confident that standards and rules are consistent. The Scottish government has criticised it as a Westminster ""power grab"", and the Welsh government has expressed fears it will lead to a race to the bottom. If one of the countries that makes up the UK lowers their standards, over the importation of chlorinated chicken, for example, the other three nations will have to accept chlorinated chicken too. It has become even more controversial because one of its main aims is to empower ministers to pass regulations even if they are contrary to the withdrawal agreement reached with the EU under the Northern Ireland protocol. The text does not disguise its intention, stating that powers contained in the bill 'have effect notwithstanding any relevant international or domestic law with which they may be incompatible or inconsistent"". The bill passed its first hurdle in parliament by 77 votes, despite a rebellion by some Tory MPs. Martin Belam and Owen Bowcott  No 10 would only say publicly on Tuesday that MPs would get a standard vote on invoking the powers contained within the bill as a statutory instrument (SI). That vote would take place only after ministers had taken the decision to use those powers, and would not prevent a potential breach of international law. Neill has said such an assurance was not enough and a standard SI vote would not provide enough opportunity for scrutiny. The bill is also likely to face a difficult passage in the Lords, where even veteran Brexiters, such as Norman Lamont, have spoken against its implications. However, a No 10 spokesman said the Salisbury convention, a non-statutory but widely respected rule saying the House of Lords would not vote down policies in a governing party's election manifesto, applied to the internal market bill. 'Guaranteeing the full economic benefit of leaving the EU to all parts of the United Kingdom and ensuring Northern Ireland's businesses and producers enjoy unfettered access to the rest of the UK were clear Conservative manifesto commitments which this legislation delivers,'the spokesman said. Some peers are likely to contest this interpretation, because the Conservative manifesto also said the party would implement the Brexit deal. 'The Lords is going to be a totally different game,'one MP backing the rebels said. 'I think Boris and Dominic Cummings are going to be shocked at the visceral anger at some of the constitutional lawyers up there.'On Tuesday, William Hague became the latest senior Conservative and fourth former Tory leader to criticise the bill, joining Theresa May, David Cameron and Michael Howard. Hague, a former foreign secretary, said passing a law that would deliberately abrogate an international treaty would be a 'serious foreign policy error'that would 'have a lasting and damaging effect on our international reputation and standing, diminishing our ability to exert our influence and protect our interests'ù. Labour sources in the House of Lords said opposition among peers was likely to focus on amending individual clauses of the bill, rather than throwing it out. They questioned whether the Salisbury-Addison convention, which implies the Lords shouldn't prevent a government from implementing its manifesto, was relevant, pointing out that the Tory manifesto said the government would: 'get Brexit done'ù. Any clash in the Lords is unlikely to be imminent, since peers rarely amend bills until their report stage, which for this legislation is not expected until mid- to late November - by which time it should be clearer whether a no-deal exit is a possibility.

The Guardian view on Brexit's foreign takeover: losing control of tech,-0.625,Negative,"Brexit was supposed to be about taking back control, re-asserting Britain's authority over what goes on within its borders and breaking free from outside meddling in our affairs. But if the proposed £30bn acquisition of Arm Holdings, a global leader in processor design, by California's Nvidia is waved through by Boris Johnson, then, far from reclaiming sovereignty, Britain would be forgoing it. Arm may be owned by Japan's SoftBank but its headquarters are in Cambridge and its intellectual property is overwhelmingly British. That means Arm is not subject to US export laws. But it would be if Silicon Fen's biggest company ended up in American hands. Competition over control of key technologies has seen states, and the EU, internationalise their standards and try to impose their regulations on other countries. The US is at the forefront of such practices. Monday was the last day that US-origin technology shipments could leave ports destined for use by Huawei, because in Washington's eyes the company's links to the Chinese government make its telecoms equipment a security threat. Arm's designs power more than 95% of smartphones. What if the White House decided Arm could no longer supply Chinese companies or European - or even UK - ones? There are more acute concerns. Nvidia, the world's most valuable chip company, says it will keep Arm in Cambridge. These assurances are not legally binding. In the undesirable event that the sale goes ahead they ought to be. About 2,500 people work in Arm's Cambridge headquarters and many more in other UK cities. There would be a brain drain to Silicon Valley. Nvidia has form: it bought and closed down another UK semiconductor company. Its ownership would threaten Arm's business model. The Cambridge outfit makes money by licensing its processor designs. Nvidia is one of Arm's customers. Other chipmakers that rely on unfettered access to Arm's cutting-edge technology would fret about losing it to a rival manufacturer. It might also spur the adoption of open-source alternatives to Arm's processors. Chip technology is at a turning point. Moore's Law - that shrinking processor size would double its performance every couple of years - has slowed to a crawl. Chip components are now atom-sized. Yet Arm's skill in design, via clever stacking, could reaccelerate processor power. Arm's adoption by Apple and Fujitsu means that it could dominate the global market in personal computers and vast data centres, which are the backbone of the internet. Hermann Hauser, Arm's co-founder, is right to say the company's sale surrenders the 'UK's most powerful trade weapon to the US'rendering 'Britain a US vassal state'ù. Decades of ministerial unwillingness to distinguish among activities that create, redistribute and destroy value has cost this country dear. Arm's sale is not a done deal. It should be halted and ministers ought to force it to be taken public, with the state holding an 'anchor'share. Mr Johnson says reverting to World Trade Organization rules would be a 'good outcome'for Britain. But these were designed for textiles not technology. Britain should protect prosperity-inducing innovation. Washington may be angered. But if the US is free to close its market to Huawei, then why can't Britain defend its national interest over Arm? Should Mr Johnson refuse to act, his Brexit would seem to be about destroying rather than creating value for the UK. ",0,Neutral
"We've seen it before': Olafur Eliasson on nazism, Brexit - and his new Berlin show",0.375,Positive,"The forced confinement of the coronavirus lockdown has inspired Olafur Eliasson's new Berlin exhibition but it has also given him time to consider the polarisation of politics in Europe and the US.   'To see the British rightwing 'òheiling' in front of the statue of [Winston] Churchill, the man who beat the Nazis, and Boris Johnson saying it was the Black Lives Matter protesters who were ruining the statue, and deliberately polarising the groups instead of uniting them, was quite something,'he says. The return of nazism 'is something we need to be greatly concerned about,'he believes. 'We've seen it before, haven't we?'But he also insists the followers, not the leaders, of the movement should be seen to some extent 'as victims as well as perpetrators'ù. 'I know that's controversial. But my point is, these hooligans, these rightwingers, these looters, these neo-Nazis, these fucking idiots, they were not born like this, as Nazis.'The Icelandic-Danish artist, who lives in Berlin, refers to the photograph which went viral of a black protester emerging from the BLM protesters in London, carrying an injured white man in a fireman's lift. 'This white guy is also a victim, which I know will be an unpopular thing to say'ù. But Johnson, like Donald Trump, is 'deliberately polarising people instead of uniting them,'says Eliasson He sees what he calls 'granularity'in the way the public is becoming inured to what once would have been shocking. 'We're slowly getting used to calling Mexicans rapists; things are being coloured and twisted and we're getting used to it and no longer questioning it - it's like Anne Frank wrote, that after the Nazis burned the books, the next day people got up and went to work. As if they took it for granted, and the problem we have right now is the same insensibility, the numbness,'he says. Closer to home the lockdown for Eliasson meant, 'an opportunity to explore intimacy, break the rules, and re-establish friendships with the ones who live next door and down the street.'Like many, the homeschooling of his two teenage children caused him a degree of vexation, not least regarding the challenges of digital communication. 'It was horrible. I actually considered making a 3D phone, thinking how do we trust each other if we can't see the way someone moves, the anger, the happiness? How can we ever get anything done in future if it's not PowerPointified, Zoomified, McKinseyfied bullshit? How do we prevent it from numbifying our last bit of intimacy? I mean how should we fall in love on a Zoom call?'He has explored some of the questions raised by the forced confinement in his latest works, his eighth solo exhibition with the neugerriemschneider in Berlin, a former margarine factory turned leading but discreet art gallery, which first championed him almost three decades ago when he was little-known. The exhibition, Near future living light, picks up on Eliasson's longtime exploration of perception, illusion and optical phenomena, with a range of hand-blown glass sculptures, a series of black-and-white water colours and three light installations at the heart of which is a dessert spoon, some cheap lenses, and a crumpled piece of foil. 'During this pandemic, people have been referring to intimacy and distancing a lot and referring to their neighbourhood as something they're much closer to than they're used to being,'he says, moving through the darkened gallery, in and out of the shifting shapes and colours of the light projections. 'And we've not just had the coronavirus, but also the whole civil rights movement - all the unpacked memories - and a reactivation of humanistic values. And we're also entering an era of reconsidering the superiority of humans for the wellbeing of the planet. The world is changing at an unbelievable rate,'he says. Eliasson, who has been held in high regard in the UK ever since his 2003 The Weather Project at Tate Modern's Turbine Hall, which was viewed by 2 million visitors, has been following the career of Johnson quite closely, he says 'like a layman'ù. And while he does not think he is 'as bad as the others'ù, such as Trump, Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, Hungary's Viktor Orb√°n and Russia's Vladimir Putin, he is nevertheless fascinated by the similarities between them. He will be following British politics closer still from now on because his new partner is the London-based Sudanese-British philanthropist, Hadeel Ibrahim. 'I will be spending a lot of time in London. I am very connected to the Brits. I think Brexit is a disaster and for some reason the Brits allowed themselves to run into a conflict of illusions ... convinced that yesterday, the Great Britain that once was, will be able to be brought back. Of course I could not feel more sorry because it's evidently not how it's going to be. 'When we take a closer look at why people reacted like this, if you ask me, it's because they felt that no one was listening to them, no one could see them and nobody met and heard them.'The night before, he addressed a gathering of Europe's foreign ministers in Berlin - minus the UK's - to mark the occasion of the German presidency of the European council. He was invited to do so by his friend, the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas. It might have felt tokenistic, reaching out to a popular cultural figurehead except, as Eliasson let the gathering know, 'the culture sector in Europe is much bigger than the car industry, with a much bigger turnover,'so it is one they cannot afford to ignore, he insists. He urged the foreign ministers to go home and stress the positive aspects of the EU. 'I said to them please can you stop talking about Europe as if it's a failed project? It's not. We have the best healthcare system, the best economic stability, the lowest unemployment in the world, the best education, the best human rights and social welfare.'His new light projections, which he describes as 'like a very small theatre, a little like a German expressionistic film, something beautiful and positive'capturing the wonders of early cinematography, are, he stresses, his attempt to 'tell a beautiful story for once. Just like I told the foreign ministers, tell me something beautiful, otherwise I can't go forward. We need to believe in a utopia; we need to be given our dreams back. We must not be deprived of our ability to dream.'Olafur Eliasson's Near future living light runs at the neugerriemschneider gallery until 24 October. ",0,Neutral
Brexit: David Cameron joins former PMs warning against Boris Johnson's bill,-0.125,Negative,"David Cameron has become the third former Conservative prime minister to express disquiet about Boris Johnson's proposal to breach international law by unilaterally redrafting part of the Brexit deal with the EU, saying he had 'misgivings'about the idea. In comments on Monday, before MPs began debating the internal market bill that sets out the plans, Cameron said: 'Passing an act of parliament and then going on to break an international treaty obligation is the very, very last thing you should contemplate. 'It should be an absolute final resort. So, I do have misgivings about what's being proposed.'Theresa May and John Major have warned in stronger terms about the plans, saying they could damage the UK's international reputation, as has another former Conservative leader, Michael Howard. Cameron said he also had to consider that the UK was 'in a vital negotiation with the EU to get a deal and I think we have to keep that context, that big prize in mind'ù. He added: 'And that's why I have perhaps held back from saying more up to now.'The comments come amid a potential Tory backbench rebellion about the plan, with the former attorney general Geoffrey Cox saying on Monday that breaking international law risked causing 'very long-term and permanent damage to this country's reputation'ù. Ahead of the second reading of the bill, the first opportunity MPs will have to debate it, Cox said he understood government arguments that the EU was acting in bad faith over the Brexit withdrawal agreement. 'But what you can't do, and what I think is wrong, is to abandon an agreement, to rewrite unilaterally parts of an agreement, which you only signed nine months ago, and to which we have given our solemn word,'he told Times Radio. He added: 'The breaking of the law, ultimately, leads to very long-term and permanent damage to this country's reputation. And it's also a question of honour, to me. We signed up, we knew what we were signing. We simply can't seek to nullify those ordinary consequences of doing that.'Cox did, however, indicate that while he could not support the bill as it stood, this could change: 'If the government were to say that these powers will only be used in these specific circumstances, where it would be lawful to act in this way, then that might well be a different position. But I haven't had those assurances yet.'Hours after Cox's comment, another Brexit-backing Tory MP and former barrister, Rehman Chishti, a key backer of Johnson in the Tory leadership contest, also said he could not support the bill. Chishti resigned as the prime minister's envoy on religious freedom in order to withdraw his support for the legislation, underlining how uncomfortable many current and former lawyers on the Conservative benches are with the proposed bill. 'I will not be able to support this bill as a matter of principle. I have real concerns with the UK breaking its legal commitments under the withdrawal agreement,'he said. 'During my 10 years in parliament and before that as a barrister, I have always acted in a manner which respects the rule of law. I feel strongly about keeping the commitments we make, if we give our word, then we must honour it. Voting for this bill as it currently stands would be contrary to the values I hold dearest.' Defending the government's stance, the policing minister, Kit Malthouse, said that even with his job he had no qualms about supporting a measure that potentially broke international law. 'I'm policing minister, so I'm responsible for the criminal law, and this is obviously a civil matter and an international law matter,'he told BBC1's Breakfast programme. Malthouse argued that the action was needed because the EU had threatened to potentially threaten food exports to Northern Ireland from Great Britain, which Brussels has rejected. He said: 'The lawyers will bat it backwards and forwards, I have absolutely no doubt about that. But from my point of view, as a non-lawyer, I'm looking at the practical effect.'Malthouse rejected the idea that the government planning to break the law could prompt people to ignore UK laws, for example new rules on coronavirus: 'We think it is a good example.'Labour's shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, disagreed, saying: 'How can we on the one hand be saying you've got to obey the law, which we all say rightly as legislators, and then the government comes along and says, well it's OK for us to break the law because it's specific and limited. We can't be having that.'The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, echoed this on his monthly call-in appearance on LBC radio. 'Here we are, on the world stage for the first time in many years on our own, and what's the first thing we do? We break a treaty,'he told one listener. Starmer said many people would be baffled at Johnson's row with the EU: 'I think the vast majority of the population would say, 'òWhat on earth is going on? You're reopening things that we thought were closed. You said you'd get a deal, get on and get a deal.' '",0,Neutral
Wagner's treaty warning to the Tories,0,Neutral,"Further to letters (10 September) regarding the Tories' disregard for the rule of law, I am reminded of the fate of Wotan and the other Germanic gods as told by Richard Wagner. Wotan the one-eyed, philandering leader, intent upon little else than prestige in his eyes and the eyes of the world, made frequent excursions on Earth. During these wanderings he carried a spear upon which were engraved runic characters spelling out the importance of treaties. His spear was the symbolic guardian of oaths and treaties. When times got tough and difficult decisions had to be made, Wotan was assisted by that master of trickery and deceit, Loge (aka Loki), who encouraged his master's duplicity in breaking solemn treaties. We know how, eventually, that all went up in flames. I wonder whether Boris Johnson, the proud classicist, is aware of the manifestly parallel paths being trodden by his own cabinet and that of Wotan and his fellow gods?

òA threat to democracy': how Europe's media reacted to UK's plan to renege on Brexit deal,0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson's internal market bill is a 'threat to democracy'by a government on an 'ideological crusade'that is driving Britain into ever-increasing isolation, while the world 'stares on in disbelief'ù, European media have concluded. 'In the space of four short years, the UK has grown from a prominent and respected member of the European Union to an isolated state, angry with its allies and closest trading neighbours - and watched by the world with disbelieving eyes,'said France's LibÈration. At the end of a week in which the UK government doubled down on its plans to pass a law 'providing for the possibility of violating a binding international treaty'it had itself negotiated and sold to voters as a triumph, the left-leaning daily said the UK had, step by steady step, 'sapped the EU27's confidence and goodwill'ù. Provocation is not uncommon as sensitive international negotiations reach their conclusion, it said, 'but this goes further. It has caused fury, and profound disbelief, abroad,'from Brussels and the other capitals of the EU to Washington. The internal market bill aims to enforce compatible rules and regulations regarding trade in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some rules, for example around food safety or air quality,† which were formerly set by EU agreements, will now be controlled by the devolved administrations or Westminster.

Martin Belam and Owen Bowcott 'Officially, negotiations with the EU on a possible free trade deal continue,'LibÈration said, 'but what will the negotiators now say to each other when there is no progress on the key sticking points - fish, governance, a level playing field? How far will Boris Johnson go? And and for how long?'Germany's S√ºddeutsche Zeitung was equally brutal. What had happened in London this week 'was simply not normal'ù, the paper said. 'With his plan to breach the Brexit treaty with the EU, Boris Johnson has shaken the very foundations of British democracy.'Britain's word was once its bond, the paper said, 'but once again, it is evident that this prime minister bends the law for his own ends. He puts his Brexit ideology above the law, just as he did a year ago when he illegally suspended parliament - and only the supreme court could stop him.'Now, the paper said, it is up to that same British parliament to stop Johnson and 'show the government who is sovereign. It is incumbent on the women and men gathered there to reject this bill intended to undermine the Brexit treaty. Johnson's manoeuvre is a threat to democracy.'In the Netherlands, De Volkskrant noted that pacta sunt servanda - the rule that agreements must be kept - was 'the oldest principle of international law'ù, so it was 'a deliberate, and hugely far-reaching, step by the Johnson government to table a bill that violates the Northern Ireland provisions in the withdrawal agreement, which is an international treaty'ù. The EU and the UK, it added, 'have little time to reach an agreement that, to a greater or lesser extent, will affect many millions of people. 'òRobust' language and other antics are all part of the negotiation process, but this latest British move crosses too many lines. 'The British voted for Brexit, not for an ideological crusade. Boris Johnson must quickly retrace his steps - and not just because the EU demands it, but because the British national interest demands it.'The French international affairs commentator Pierre Haski pointed out on public radio France Inter that the British government's latest move was so shocking it had prompted the EU to threaten legal action, 'an astonishing first in a saga already far from lacking in plot twists'ù. The only response possible, Haski said, was 'that of the EU27: a unity that has so far withstood all of the tests thrown at it by London, which plainly wants nothing more than division. Plus the certainty that if these talks end in failure, everyone will suffer - but the UK far more than the rest.'Le Monde said the world was left guessing at Johnson's true intentions, wondering whether he 'can really prefer no deal to a compromise on the future relationship. Has he truly pulled the pin out of the grenade by deciding to renege on the divorce agreement and trigger a complete breakdown with Brussels?'Spain's El Pais said Downing Street clearly had 'no intention of dialling down the tension in a standoff that it has itself provoked, insisting that the sovereignty of the British parliament takes precedence over any international treaty'ù. The paper suggested Johnson had 'embraced the flag of sovereignty to camouflage its decision - already taken - that there will be no free trade agreement with the EU'ù.

In a remarkable scene in the Commons last week that astonished Conservative backbenchers, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, admitted the internal market bill 'does break international law in a very specific and limited way'ù. The publication of the bill on Wednesday, under which key parts of the withdrawal agreement agreed last year with the EU would be negated, has infuriated Brussels and prompted a Tory rebellion. With the bill's second reading on Monday before a parliament vote, Labour has confirmed it will vote against it in its current form. Buckland, who as justice secretary has taken an oath to uphold the rule of law, faced repeated pressure on The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday to say whether he would consider resigning over the bill.

We are not at that stage.'Asked again directly if he would resign if the government breaks international law, Buckland said: 'What I will be seeking to do, and indeed the government will be seeking to do, is to resolve that conflict as soon as possible.'He added: 'I don't believe we're going to get to that stage. I know in my mind what I have to do. But the government collectively here also has a responsibility, we've got to resolve any conflict, that's what we will do.'Pressed a further time if he would resign at the point the government actually breaks international law, he said: 'I don't believe we're going to get to that point and that is why I shall be working very hard to ensure we don't.'There is growing discontent among Conservative backbenchers over the bill, with senior Tory MP Sir Bob Neill tabling an amendment to impose a parliamentary lock on any changes to the withdrawal agreement. On Friday, Boris Johnson sought to quell signs of a rebellion during a Zoom call with his MPs, telling them that the clauses in the bill were necessary to prevent a foreign power from 'breaking up our country'ù. However, on Sunday, the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, dismissed the prime minister's assertion that the Northern Ireland protocol could be used to break up the UK. 'Protocol on IE/NI is not a threat to the integrity of the UK. We agreed this delicate compromise with Boris Johnson and his government in order to protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. We could not have been clearer about the consequences of Brexit,'he tweeted. Barnier also denied the EU is refusing to list the UK as a third country for food imports. 'To be listed, we need to know in full what a country's rules are, including for imports. The same objective process applies to all listed countries,'he said. Speaking on the Marr programme, Labour's shadow cabinet office minister, Rachel Reeves, confirmed her party would vote against the internal market bill in its current form as well as urging both the UK and the EU 'to stop the posturing and get back to the negotiating table and take this seriously'ù. She said: 'So legislation is needed, a bill is needed, but we would like to see a greater level of collaboration between the nations of the United Kingdom rather than a power grab by Westminster.'Asked if Labour would support Neill's amendment, she said her party 'would need to look at the detail of that amendment'and that it would be tabling amendments of its own as well. The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain's entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a 'deep-seated hostility'towards the European project. With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home. The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted ""yes"". Margaret Thatcher, later to be leader of the Conservative party, campaigned to remain. Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the ""iron lady"" marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand 'our own money back'claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back'despite being one of the 'three poorer'members of the community. It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.† Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in 'embryo'ù. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU. Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was 'òno, no, no' to what she saw as Delors' continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch's Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered 'Up yours Delors'front page. A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of 'a single market without barriers - visible or invisible - giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world's wealthiest and most prosperous people"". Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.† Tony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers' rights. Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. 'Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,'he said in his maiden speech. 'The level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.'Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro. EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club. Anti-immigration hysteria seems to take hold with references to 'cockroches'by Katie Hopkins in the Sun and tabloid headlines such as 'How many more can we take?'and 'Calais crisis: send in the dogs'ù. David Cameron returns from Brussels with an EU reform package - but it isn't enough to appease the Eurosceptic wing of his own party The UK votes to leave the European Union, triggering David Cameron's resignation and paving the way for Theresa May to become prime minister After years of parliamentary impasse during Theresa May's attempt to get a deal agreed, the UK leaves the EU. Meanwhile, Ireland's foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, told the show that a post-Brexit trade agreement was still possible and that a no-deal would represent a failure of politics. 'Both the British and Irish economies are going to be damaged significantly and that will be a significant failure of politics not anything else,'he warned. He also dismissed the idea that Brussels would block food deliveries to Northern Ireland, adding: 'The British government is behaving in an extraordinary way and British people need to know that, because outside of Britain the reputation of the UK as a trusted negotiating partner is being damaged.'

A Japan trade deal is little consolation if Britain is locked out of the EU,-0.75,Negative,"There was a consistent message from business leaders to international trade secretary Liz Truss's claims that she had signed a 'historic'deal with Japan to lower tariffs and gain access to previously restricted markets.  Thank you, they said, but could you please sign a deal with the EU because that is our most important export market. Truss is not a minister to be moved by such demands. The former chief secretary to the Treasury has a mission to bolt together as many trade deals with non-EU countries as she can while No 10 takes on the task of signing a comprehensive agreement with Brussels. Officials at the signing ceremony with Japan confirmed that the deal was expected to boost UK trade with the world's third-largest economy by an estimated £15.2bn, though there was no date by which this figure would be achieved. It would also add only 0.07% to UK gross domestic product, which compares with forecasts by government economists of a 5% loss of GDP from leaving the EU customs union and single market.  No wonder Mike Hawes, the boss of car lobby group the SMMT, and Adam Marshall, head of the British Chambers of Commerce, were quick to point out that a deal with the EU was far more important. Truss was undaunted, though her attempts so far to sign other significant deals, and especially with the US, have proved fruitless.  Under normal circumstances, a deal with the US is not a priority. It might be the largest economy in the world and the single largest destination for UK goods and services exports outside the EU, but it is an open market characterised by low import tariffs. That was the situation until Donald Trump began his bruising battle with China over what he claimed were trade barriers damaging to US companies. In the last couple of years this trade war has expanded to take in the EU. Importantly for Truss, the UK has been one of the biggest losers. In particular, single malt Scotch whisky has suffered from a 25% import tariff, pricing it out of the US market. Truss needs to win over the US to push trade tariffs back down to more normal levels, or better still to zero. However, there is a high price to be paid for favours in Washington. Farmers are an especially powerful lobby group in the US and want full access to foreign markets as the price of any trade deal. They expect Congress to abide by this maxim, and it usually does. Before the US pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal that included Australia, Vietnam and Japan, Washington had extracted concessions for US beef and other farm produce that were effectively banned in many TPP countries up to that point. The former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, who last week officially joined Truss's advisory board, has long wrestled with criticism that his determination to sign trade deals meant that many domestic industries were thrown overboard, including agriculture and manufacturing.  Truss is under pressure to protect UK agriculture from being steamrollered by cheap US produce. If she is to uphold farming standards - ones that would allow the continued export of livestock and food to the EU - Truss must not lower UK rules in order to give access to industrial-scale farmers in the US who use growth hormones on their beef and chlorine washes on their chicken.  Whether to comply with the US or the EU rules is not a question that troubles business leaders. It is the EU every time. This makes sense when you consider the numbers. If you include services industries, imports and exports between Britain and the EU were worth a total of £672.5bn last year, more than 20 times the value of UK-Japan trade and three times the £200bn sent back and forth to the US. A deal with the EU will be the historic prize. The appointment this week of the first female leader of a Wall Street bank was greeted with a roar of approval. Jane Fraser, the Scottish-American banker from St Andrews who will lead Citi, is 'a pioneer'ù, declared David Solomon over at Goldman Sachs. It is indeed a landmark moment. But, now that a breakthrough has finally happened on Wall Street, a bastion of corporate maleness, should we expect a rush of female appointments? Don't bet a cent on it. That hasn't been the wider experience in the US or the UK. The first woman to become chief executive of a FTSE 100 company was Dame Marjorie Scardino in 1997, and her appointment at Pearson was similarly hailed as groundbreaking. Almost a quarter of a century later, one can say the predicted rush of female FTSE bosses was a trickle. The highest number within the 100-strong club at any one time has been seven. Within banking, the first female chief executive of a UK top-four firm was Alison Rose at NatWest Group, appointed as recently as last year. It's true that the UK's top boardrooms overall have become less male over the years. A third of board positions at FTSE 100 companies are held by women, the Hampton-Alexander Review found this year. Yet the review also highlighted a 'concerning lack of female representation in senior leadership and key executive roles'in FTSE 350 companies: only 15 female finance directors among FTSE 100 firms, for example. In the US, the picture is similar: progress, but painfully slow. Only 31 women lead S&P 500 firms. On Wall Street, there are two men for every woman on banks' operating committees, according to Bloomberg. Fraser's success is a personal triumph, but the corporate world has not undergone a revolution. When Rio Tinto announced last week that its chief executive, Jean-SÈbastien Jacques, would be stepping down, it marked a new low for the mining giant - but potentially also an inflection point in corporate accountability. Jacques resigned, alongside two other senior bosses, after investors lined up to condemn the company's leadership for overseeing the destruction of an Australian heritage site of importance to Indigenous communities.  The world's biggest iron ore miner destroyed two ancient caves in Pilbara, Western Australia, after blowing up the Juukan Gorge rock shelters, which held irreplaceable artefacts. The executive clearout was by 'mutual agreement'ù, according to a statement, but it should send a clear signal to others culpable for environmental destruction in the pursuit of corporate profit. Environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) may once have been regarded as a box-ticking exercise for company executives, but growing public intolerance of shoddy ESG standards can no longer be ignored. Investors, too, are unwilling to turn a blind eye to poor practice. If the 2015 Samarco dam disaster, which resulted from a joint venture between miners BHP Billiton and Vale, had happened today it is difficult to imagine that executives would be let off as lightly as they were at the time. The dam's collapse left 19 dead, hundreds homeless and is considered the single worst environmental disaster in Brazil's history. For Andrew Mackenzie, BHP's then boss, it meant sacrificing a short-term bonus, even though hundreds living near the dam are still without homes. The past loss of life and natural heritage at the hands of mining companies can never be replaced. But the swift condemnation of reckless corporate greed today could help safeguard the future.

"Labour will back new Brexit legislation if PM addresses concerns, says Starmer",0.625,Positive,"Sir Keir Starmer has committed Labour to back Boris Johnson's new Brexit legislation if the prime minister addresses 'substantial cross-party concerns'ù. The Labour leader accused the prime minister of having 'turned the clock back'and of 'reigniting old rows'by working to override his own withdrawal agreement. Starmer contended a free trade deal can still be struck with Brussels if negotiators from both sides 'hunker down in good faith and break the logjam'ù. And, writing in the Sunday Telegraph, he threw down the gauntlet to Johnson as he faces a rebellion from within his own party by saying Labour could back the internal market bill. 'Labour is prepared to play its part in making that happen. If the government fixes the substantial cross-party concerns that have been raised about the internal market bill, then we are prepared to back it,'Starmer said. 'But if they do not, and the talks collapse, then it is their failure and incompetence that will have let the British people down.'But the changes necessary to win Labour's support are understood to be major, with it needing to no longer risk breaching international law and to address devolved administrations concerns of a 'power grab'ù. Starmer said ministers are facing a task 'as ludicrous as it is frustrating'in telling the public to stick to rules to prevent the spread of coronavirus while defending the potential breach of international law. 'The priorities of the British people. We should be getting on with defeating this virus, not banging on about Europe,'the MP said. 'Get on with Brexit and defeat the virus. That should be the government's mantra.'Senior Tories are tabling an amendment to the Bill, which is due to be debated in the Commons on Monday. And three Conservative former leaders, including ex-prime ministers Theresa May and Sir John Major, are among those to have called on Johnson to change the legislation. Major and Tony Blair united in the Sunday Times to condemn Johnson's Brexit legislation as imperilling the Irish peace process, trade negotiations and the UK's integrity. The Conservative and Labour grandees wrote: 'It puts the Good Friday agreement at risk, because it negates the predictability, political stability and legal clarity that are integral to the delicate balance between the north and south of Ireland that is at the core of the peace process. 'This has wide-ranging ramifications. It will not only make negotiation with the EU more difficult, but also any trade negotiations with other nations, including the United States. Once trust is undermined, distrust becomes prevalent. 'We both opposed Brexit. We both accept it is now happening. But this way of negotiating, with reason cast aside in pursuit of ideology and cavalier bombast posing as serious diplomacy, is irresponsible, wrong in principle and dangerous in practice. 'It raises questions that go far beyond the impact on Ireland, the peace process and negotiations for a trade deal - crucial though they are. It questions the very integrity of our nation.'",0,Neutral
"Brussels could 'carve up' UK if Tories reject Brexit bill, says Johnson",0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson has said his controversial legislation to override parts of his Brexit deal is needed to end EU threats to install a 'blockade'in the Irish Sea. The prime minister said Brussels could 'carve up our country'and 'seriously endanger peace and stability'in Northern Ireland if Conservative MPs rebel to block the internal market bill. Johnson is working to quell a plan to amend the legislation from senior Tories who are angry that it could break international law by overriding the withdrawal agreement signed with the EU last year. The EU has said the move is a serious breach of trust and has threatened to take legal action if Johnson does not alter the bill by the end of the month. But the prime minister has argued that it is 'crucial for peace and for the union itself'and said voting it down would reduce the chances of a trade deal with the EU. Writing in the Telegraph, Johnson said: 'We are now hearing that unless we agree to the EU's terms, the EU will use an extreme interpretation of the Northern Ireland protocol to impose a full-scale trade border down the Irish Sea. 'We are being told that the EU will not only impose tariffs on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but that they might actually stop the transport of food products from GB to NI. 'I have to say that we never seriously believed that the EU would be willing to use a treaty, negotiated in good faith, to blockade one part of the UK, to cut it off; or that they would actually threaten to destroy the economic and territorial integrity of the UK.'He said 'in the last few weeks'he learned his negotiators had discovered there 'may be a serious misunderstanding about the terms'of the withdrawal agreement he signed in October. Johnson argued it was agreed during 'torrid'days with the deadline for a deal fast approaching while 'negotiating with one hand tied behind our back'because parliament blocked a no-deal Brexit. 'If we fail to pass this bill, or if we weaken its protections, then we will in fact reduce the chances of getting that Canada-style deal,'he wrote, 'Let's remove this danger to the very fabric of the United Kingdom. Let's make the EU take their threats off the table. And let's get this bill through, back up our negotiators, and protect our country.'Both Ireland and the EU, however, have warned that Johnson's plans pose a serious risk to the peace process rather than protecting the Good Friday agreement. The prime minister on Friday evening held a conference call with around 250 MPs to try to drum up support for the bill, and warned them against a return to the 'miserable, squabbling days of last autumn'ù.  Johnson appeared not to have ended the disquiet within his party during the call, with senior backbencher Sir Bob Neill saying he was not reassured by the speech. Neill, who is tabling an amendment to the bill, which he says would impose a 'parliamentary lock'on any changes to the withdrawal agreement, said he still contends that it contains 'objectionable'elements.

The Guardian view on the 'òfestival of Brexit': don't write it off,0,Neutral,"When, at the 2018 Tory party conference, Theresa May announced a 'nationwide festival in celebration of the creativity and innovation of the United Kingdom'to take place in 2022, it was immediately dubbed a 'festival of Brexit'and written off by the UK's overwhelmingly Europhile arts world. This week, as the first open call for creative teams has been announced, the hostility to the £120m event - which as yet lacks a name - has again intensified. What is the point of a festival whose very conception seems designed to antagonise half the population? Shouldn't the money be used now, to try to help an arts world that is staggering under the appalling pressures inflicted by Covid-19? Why would any self-respecting artist agree to put their name to such a vainglorious event - one that was certainly conceived to showcase the supposed virtues of 'Global Britain'and an increasingly ragged union? It is a tempting impulse to obliterate the very thought of such a festival. But there are also good reasons not to. Martin Green is in charge: he is the man who oversaw Danny Boyle's memorable, uplifting 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony, and was the mastermind behind Hull's successful year as the UK city of culture for 2016. He has a track record of converting ideas riven with difficult politics into events that transcend divisions of opinion to become meaningful and joyous. He appears determined to run the festival at face value, as an event showcasing the UK's creativity, rather than one celebrating some hollow, bogus 'independence'from the European Union. The chair of the festival (which is being run as an independent company) is the experienced and tough-minded Vikki Heywood, a former executive director of the Royal Shakespeare Company and board member of the 2012 Cultural Olympiad. Ms Heywood was also the chair of the first world war commemoration 14-18 NOW, another event that encountered initial scepticism, before the quality of the artworks produced - including Jeremy Deller's unforgettable Somme commemoration, We're Here Because We're Here - banished fears that memorialising the conflict might end up mawkish and jingoistic. Mr Green and Ms Heywood are figures who have shown that they can defend their integrity and independence from political interference. Admittedly, they may find that banishing Olympics-scepticism is child's play compared with negotiating the divisive role that Brexit has played in the UK. But they are big enough figures to hold the line - or to walk away should circumstances demand. On a pragmatic level, the money for the festival is ringfenced. It will not be diverted into Covid-19 rescue operations. Boris Johnson has confirmed that the event will go ahead. Since the funding has been set aside for commissioning artists, it may as well be harnessed - and if it is not harnessed by good creative teams, it will certainly be harnessed by someone. This is the festival that no one in the arts asked for, but it is what they are getting. It may as well be turned to good use. ",-0.25,Negative
Damage done by Tories' disregard for rule of law,0,Neutral,"The issue of whether the UK government will ever be trusted again after deciding to openly and decisively break the law is obviously very serious (Government admits new Brexit bill 'òwill break international law', 8 September). More worryingly, once again the Tories are demonstrating an open disregard for what others think of them. Last year they showed a willingness to abuse their power with the prorogation of parliament. More recently, leading officials have shown that rules do not apply to them (Dominic Cummings' trip to Durham and the support he got from ministers). The lies, deceptions and broken promises we saw throughout the Brexit fiasco continue in their handling of Covid-19. All this is done openly. What people think does not bother them.  This blatant disregard of any attempt to honour the trust that the people of Britain have (or had) in them is already showing itself as the 'new normal'in the wider community. For example, big businesses, following the government's lead in abuse of power, are sacking and rehiring on worse employment terms. Employees are being bullied back into work without the necessary assurances regarding their safety. The hospitality sector, as well as schools and other 'group gatherings'ù, are encouraged to deceive people about their safety even though we are seeing a massive increase in Covid-19 cases. Dishonesty is the new norm. We should not be surprised therefore when we see the public following suit.Shaun V SoperMidhurst, West Sussex '¢ The UK's chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, rightly stressed in two recent interviews the UK's status as an independent state. However, as Ursula von der Leyen said (Report, 7 September), the UK also has obligations under international law and, as Philip Hammond (former Conservative chancellor) said, breaking the agreement with the EU 'would be incredibly dangerous and would hugely damage our standing on the world stage'ù. A country, independent or not, that reneges on its legal obligations in this way would rapidly be viewed as an international pariah. Not, one would hope, a policy outcome sought even by this government.Paul HewitsonSneem, Co Kerry, Ireland '¢ The recent resignation of Sir Jonathan Jones is a shocking indictment of the government's latest EU exit strategy (UK's top legal civil servant quits over Brexit deal changes, 8 September).

"If you think the UK isn't corrupt, you haven't looked hard enough",0,Neutral,"Fear, shame, embarrassment: these brakes no longer apply. The government has discovered that it can bluster through any scandal. No minister need resign. No one need apologise. No one need explain. As public outrage grows over the billions of pounds of coronavirus contracts issued by the government without competition, it seems determined only to award more of them. Never mind that the consulting company Deloitte, whose personnel circulate in and out of government, has been strongly criticised for the disastrous  system it devised to supply protective equipment to the NHS. It has now been granted a massive new contract to test the population for Covid-19. Never mind that some of these contracts have reportedly cost taxpayers £800 for every protective overall delivered. Never mind that at least two multi-million pound contracts appear to have been issued to dormant companies. Awarding contracts to unusual companies, without advertising, transparency or competition now appears to have been adopted as the norm. Several of the firms that have benefited from this largesse are closely linked to senior figures in the government. Every week, Boris Johnson looks more like George I, under whose government vast fortunes were made by political favourites, through monopoly contracts for military procurement. Any pretence of fiscal rectitude or democratic accountability has been abandoned. With four more years and the support of the billionaire press, who cares? The way the government handles public money looks to me like an open invitation to corruption. While it is hard to show that any individual deal is corrupt, the framework under which this money is dispensed invites the perception. When you connect the words corruption and the United Kingdom, people tend to respond with shock and anger. Corruption, we believe, is something that happens abroad. Indeed, if you check the rankings published by Transparency International or the Basel Institute, the UK looks like one of the world's cleanest countries. But this is an artefact of the narrow criteria they use. As Jason Hickel points out in his book The Divide, theft by officials in poorer nations amounts to between $20bn and $40bn a year. It's a lot of money, and it harms wellbeing and democracy in those countries. But this figure is dwarfed by the illicit flows of money from poor and middling nations that are organised by multinational companies and banks. The US research group Global Financial Integrity estimates that $1.1tn a year flows illegally out of poorer nations, stolen from them through tax evasion and the transfer of money within corporations. This practice costs sub-Saharan Africa around 6% of its GDP. The looters rely on secrecy regimes to process and hide their stolen money. The corporate tax haven index published by the Tax Justice Network shows that the three countries that have done most to facilitate this theft are the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. All of them are British territories. Jersey, a British dependency, comes seventh on the list. These places are effectively satellites of the City of London. But because they are overseas, the City can benefit from 'nefarious activities '¶ while allowing the British government to maintain distance when scandals arise'ù, says the network. The City of London's astonishing exemption from the UK's freedom of information laws creates an extra ring of secrecy. The UK also appears to be the money-laundering capital of the world. In a devastating article, Oliver Bullough revealed how easy it has become to hide your stolen loot and fraudulent schemes here, using a giant loophole in company law: no one checks the ownership details you enter when creating your company. You can, literally, call yourself Mickey Mouse, with a registered address on Mars, and get away with it. Bullough discovered owners on the Companies House site called 'Xxx Stalin'and 'Mr Mmmmmm Xxxxxxxxxxx'ù, whose address was given as 'Mmmmmmm, Mmmmmm, Mmm, MMM'ù. One investigation found that 4,000 company owners, according to their submitted details, were under the age of two. By giving false identities, company owners in the UK can engage in the industrial processing of dirty money with no fear of getting caught. Even when the UK's company registration system was revealed as instrumental to the world's biggest known money-laundering scheme, the Danske Bank scandal, the government turned a blind eye. A new and terrifying book by the Financial Times journalist Tom Burgis, Kleptopia, follows a global current of dirty money, and the murders and kidnappings required to sustain it. Again and again, he found, this money, though it might originate in Russia, Africa or the Middle East, travels through London. The murders and kidnappings don't happen here, of course: our bankers have clean cuffs and manicured nails. The National Crime Agency estimates that money laundering costs the UK £100bn a year. But it makes much more. With the money come people fleeing the consequences of their crimes, welcomed into this country through the government's 'golden visa'scheme: a red carpet laid out for the very rich. None of this features in the official definitions of corruption. Corruption is what little people do. But kleptocrats in other countries are merely clients of the bigger thieves in London. Processing everyone else's corruption is the basis of much of the wealth of this country. When you start to understand this, the contention by the author of Gomorrah, Roberto Saviano, that the UK is the most corrupt nation on Earth, begins to make sense. These activities are a perpetuation of colonial looting: a means by which vast riches are siphoned out of poorer countries and into the hands of the super-rich. The UK's great and unequal wealth was built on colonial robbery: the land and labour stolen in Ireland, America and Africa, the humans stolen by slavery, the $45tn bled from India. Just as we distanced ourselves from British slave plantations in the Caribbean, somehow believing that they had nothing to do with us, now we distance ourselves from British organised crime, much of which also happens in the Caribbean. The more you learn, the more you realise that this is what it's really about: grand larceny is the pole around which British politics revolve. A no-deal Brexit, which Boris Johnson seems to favour, is likely to cement the UK's position as the global entrepot for organised crime. When the EU's feeble restraints are removed, under a government that seems entirely uninterested in basic accountability, the message we send to the rest of the world will be even clearer than it is today: come here to wash your loot.

The Guardian view on the internal market bill: a legal wrecking ball,-0.75,Negative,"To protect national sovereignty, the government is proposing a law that will undermine the deal it signed last year with the European Union to restore that same sovereignty. The logic is hard to fathom. It makes sense only in the context of a Brexit project that can never be completed to the perfect satisfaction of the Conservative party. The internal market bill, published on Wednesday, represents the latest stage in the quest for an immaculate separation from Europe. Every vestige of EU influence over the territory of the UK must be purged. In pursuit of that goal, no diplomatic norm or constitutional principle - not even the duty to uphold international treaties - is safe. The most controversial target is the provisions in the withdrawal agreement that retain a requirement for Northern Ireland to stay aligned with certain EU standards. The further Britain diverges from the single market, the more checks have to be applied to goods crossing the Irish Sea and the more UK businesses operating in Northern Ireland must adhere to Brussels rules. That is the insurance policy that Boris Johnson signed to avoid land border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Perhaps Mr Johnson did not understand that policy. Perhaps he never intended to honour it. Either way, he now wants to legislate a fantasy version of what he wished he had signed into reality. That involves clauses in the new bill that grant unilateral powers to ministers to override the withdrawal agreement. Regulations issued for that purpose are 'not to be regarded as unlawful on the grounds of any incompatibility or inconsistency with relevant international or domestic law'ù. Thus the bill seeks to indemnify the government against any legal challenge relating to use of its special powers - a law to put ministers above the law. MPs must not acquiesce in such a thing. It is a sinister constitutional absurdity, quite aside from the bad faith it shows with regard to Brexit negotiations, and the damage it does to the nation's reputation as a trustworthy trading partner. It depletes any moral authority that the UK might summon as a democratic state criticising the action of authoritarian regimes. It tells the world that Mr Johnson sees international law as a footling thing and that he condones casual breaches for the sake of expediency. This is a direction in British statecraft welcomed only by despots and crooks. The same cavalier spirit is discernible in the bill's handling of devolved matters. Brexit creates the need for a pan-UK regulatory framework to replace the EU one. That shift repatriates powers from Brussels to Westminster, and the devolved administrations want them to trickle further down to Edinburgh and Cardiff. Mr Johnson does not. On the contrary, the bill reinforces Westminster authority in ways that trample the spirit of devolution and tamper with its legal foundations. Nationalists see it as a power grab. Holyrood can withhold assent under the Sewel convention, which would not thwart the bill but inflame an already tender constitutional wound. Mr Johnson shows no sign of understanding how much harm this law might do, or of caring if he does. It takes a practical administrative task and fashions it into a wrecking ball, swinging wildly into EU negotiations, the UK's international reputation and the union. That is quite an accomplishment for one piece of legislation, but not one of which the country can be proud. Some of the damage is done already. Parliament must now limit the rest. ",0,Neutral
Brexit bill criticised as 'eye-watering' breach of international law,0,Neutral,"The government has unveiled plans to give ministers sweeping powers to 'disapply'part of the Brexit deal that Boris Johnson signed in January, in a move that has shocked Brussels, threatens to provoke a rebellion by Conservative MPs and caused Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, to warn there will be 'absolutely no chance'of a US-UK trade deal if it presses ahead with the move. The plans have prompted such concerns that the European commission vice president Maro≈° ≈†efƒçoviƒç will travel to London on Thursday for an 'extraordinary'meeting with cabinet minister Michael Gove of the joint committee set up to implement the withdrawal agreement. Cabinet ministers have admitted the bill breaks international law. But Johnson's spokesman defended the change on Wednesday, saying it was a necessary clarification of an agreement that had been rushed through in January. 'The withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol aren't like any other treaty,'he said. 'It was agreed at pace in the most challenging possible political circumstances to deliver on a clear political decision by the British people and with the clear, overriding purpose of protecting the special circumstances of Northern Ireland. It contains ambiguities and in key areas there is a lack of clarity. 'It was written on the assumption that subsequent agreements to clarify these aspects could be reached between us and the EU on the detail. And that may yet be possible and we continue to engage fully with the joint committee process. But as I said before, we cannot allow damaging default positions to kick in if we can't agree.'The publication of the bill was met with astonishment among EU and legal experts who said it was far from the 'few clarifications'that Downing Street had claimed it was seeking. The bill sets out what one legal expert described as an 'eye-watering'attempt to override the Northern Ireland protocol of the withdrawal agreement. The bill could yet prompt a rebellion by Conservative backbenchers. The veteran Tory MP for North Thanet, Sir Roger Gale, said he would not support the move. 'Put simply, I will not vote to break the law,'he said. Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, said he was disturbed by the plans. Asked by the BBC if he might consider voting against the legislation, he said: 'Let's see what happens. Lots of concerns were raised in the house, and the government will be conscious of that.'The former prime minister Sir John Major said breaking international law would come with a price that could never be recovered. 'For generations, Britain's word solemnly given has been accepted by friend and foe. Our signature on any treaty or agreement has been sacrosanct,'he said. 'Over the last century, as our military strength has dwindled, our word has retained its power. If we lose our reputation for honouring the promises we make, we will have lost something beyond price that may never be regained.'And in a statement yesterday, Pelosi said: 'Whatever form it takes, Brexit cannot be allowed to imperil the Good Friday agreement, including the stability brought by the invisible and frictionless border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. 'The UK must respect the Northern Ireland protocol as signed with the EU to ensure the free flow of goods across the border. 'If the UK violates that international treaty and Brexit undermines the Good Friday accord, there will be absolutely no chance of a US-UK trade agreement passing the Congress.'The bill, published on Wednesday, explicitly seeks to give powers to ministers to unilaterally disregard some of the arrangements in the Northern Ireland protocol. Another proposal is a rewriting of the state aid rules post-Brexit in Northern Ireland, removing the 'direct effect'of EU law which gives any member of the public or business a right to sue in the event of a dispute under European law. And it unpicks article 10 of the protocol in relation to state aid and states that it will 'not be interpreted in accordance with case law of the European court'or 'in accordance with any legislative act of the EU'ù. One seasoned observer said: 'It is an absolute assertion of ministerial rights over the courts.'Northern Ireland's most senior judge, speaking to BBC NI in words quoted by Irish broadcaster RT√â, said he was 'disappointed'by the plans to override parts of the protocol. 'An indication that you're going to break international law '¶ is something that may well undermine trust in the government and certainly may undermine trust in the system of the administration of justice,'Lord Chief Justice Declan Morgan added. The move now threatens Brexit talks. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, condemned the bill on Wednesday. One source said the logical conclusion was that negotiations could be suspended this week. Ireland's taoiseach, Miche√°l Martin, said he would be registering his 'complete opposition'in a phone call to Johnson. 'Proper negotiations are conducted on a 'òno surprise' basis '¶ and to drag Northern Ireland back into this is extremely divisive - and dangerous,'he told the D√°il, Ireland's parliament. One Irish source said: 'The most despicable aspect of this is the way they have dragged Northern Ireland's problems into their disagreements over Brexit. The way they were talking about doing it to protect peace was shameless, absolutely shameless.'Paragraphs 42, 43 and 45 of the bill were described by legal experts as a blunt rewriting of the international treaty. 'This is a remarkable piece of legislation and it expressly contravenes our international legal obligations to a point that the legislation itself says this is the intention, as did Brandon Lewis [the Northern Ireland secretary] yesterday,'said Catherine Barnard, a professor of European law at Cambridge University, who added the bill was a 'really eye-watering'attempt to rewrite the Northern Ireland protocol. Steve Peers, a professor of law at the University of Essex, said: 'It is an obvious breach of international law.'Paragraph 42 of the bill is unambiguously headed 'Power to disapply or modify export declarations and other exit procedures'ù, a reference to checks due to take place on goods crossing the Irish Sea. Paragraph 42 gives the government powers to disregard article 10 of the protocol that defines the state aid rules, saying article 10 should 'not to be interpreted - (i) in accordance with case law of the European court; (ii) in accordance with any legislative act of the EU, including regulations, directives and decisions.'Barnard said that while she was surprised by the bluntness of the bill, it had to be explicit to avoid legal challenge. One observer wondered if the attempt to place the powers in Westminster was not 'revenge'for the supreme court decision to rule last September that prorogation of parliament was unlawful.

'Festival of Brexit' organisers launch application process,0,Neutral,"Critics have dubbed it a 'festival of Brexit'and pilloried it as a waste of £120m of public money, but the first plans for the festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland - announced by Theresa May in 2018 - will officially launch on Wednesday.  Using the working title Festival UK * 2022 organisers have opened applications for teams who wish to be commissioned to come up with ideas for the event. As the asterisk suggests, the event's final title is yet to be decided, said the festival's boss Martin Green, formerly in charge of the Olympic ceremonies and Hull's year as UK City of Culture. 'We don't want to name and brand the festival until we know its content.'Green is the chief creative officer for an event which has been widely ridiculed since it was announced by May's government - who made comparisons to the Festival of Britain in 1951 and the Great Exhibition of 1851 - and given the go-ahead by Boris Johnson last year. But it is not about Brexit, insisted Green. It is about bringing people together for a national celebration of creativity and innovation and surely that is a good thing, he said. 'A lot of people, and I know some of them very well, were quite alarmed about the project when it was first launched because of what people said it might be. Now people can see what the project actually is, I hope those fears will dissipate.'The title of the festival is important, with one recent report suggesting that the Scottish National party wanted the word UK dropped from the branding. 'To be honest, we absolutely don't know where that came from,'said Green. 'We have been working with the UK government and the governments of the other three nations really successfully from the outset. They have all signed up to do the project '¶ the same project in the same way.'The festival will open applications on Wednesday for individuals and organisations to create teams which will then be commissioned to come up with ideas for the event. Thirty teams, each receiving £100,000, will be chosen. 'This is the phase which is usually hidden from view because most of the time people go out and directly commission,'said Green. One reason was to ensure 'we are reaching out to new talent and new blood and widen the pool'ù. The teams can be between three and eight and could include organisations and individuals, whether artists, scientists, mathematicians or engineers. Green gave the example of 'an AI company from Wales working with a biochemist from Cornwall and a visual artist from the Scotland'ù. Crucially they are not yet pitching ideas. 'We see too much of that happening. I don't like artists and creatives not to be paid for what they are doing. 'It is possibly the most important work you will ever do on a project, yet sometimes you do see 'òtell us your idea and if we like it we'll fund it''ù. The eventual plan is for 10 ideas to be chosen which will then become the festival. 'We are trying not to pre-determine things but to absolutely let the experts, the creatives, respond to a challenge and see what happens. Ultimately we are about new, exciting, very different ways of engaging with people creatively'ù. Green acknowledged there was still a way to go in convincing people of the festival's worth. Before Covid-19, Green said he and his team talked to nearly 300 individuals and organisations across the UK: 'Once you get the opportunity to sit down with people and say this is what we are thinking about doing, they engage with it. 'There is always a journey and different people and different sets of people come on board at different times. Why would I expect everybody to come on board just because I say so? This is about us proving that this is going to be a great and valuable world-beating project.'",0.125,Positive
Brandon Lewis breaks cardinal law for MPs and tells the half-truth,0,Neutral,"Not even his most generous friends would describe Brandon Lewis as particularly bright. He is one of parliament's natural plodders. A born follower. A man who has unexpectedly found himself in the cabinet both by virtue of his more talented colleagues having disqualified themselves for being awkward and having no principles of his own he could possibly compromise. But there seemed little harm in Boris Johnson promoting Brandon to Northern Ireland secretary once the Brexit withdrawal agreement and Northern Ireland protocol had been agreed in parliament last year, as there was little potential for him to screw up too badly. That, though, was before the prime minister had, at the weekend, unilaterally declared that there were some bits of the Northern Ireland protocol he was unhappy with and planned to backtrack on. Which left Lewis with one of the more difficult and embarrassing hours as a minister as he struggled to answer an urgent question on the latest U-turn. By the end both he and the government were in tatters. It was something of an open goal for Louise Haigh, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, but she gratefully accepted the opportunity with some style. Labour wanted Brexit to proceed on the terms the government had promised with the protocol intact. And given that the government's chief legal adviser had resigned earlier that morning - civil servants have scruples about law-breaking even if politicians don't - it rather looked as if Boris was planning to renege on his own treaty. One that he had drawn up himself, forced through parliament in under three days and on which he had successfully fought a general election last December. Now it appeared that the government had had second thoughts. That its treaty hadn't been an 'oven-ready'deal after all and that it was planning to breach the ministerial code by breaking the law. Haigh even ended by quoting Margaret Thatcher, every Conservative MP's patron saint of conservatism. The UK did not renounce international treaties. Beads of sweat began to appear on Lewis's forehead. He could sense he was in trouble, he just didn't know exactly how much, as he was far too insignificant to have been included in any of the decision-making. All he had been given was a one-paragraph brief telling him just to bluff it out as best he could for the duration of the urgent question. So he began to say any old nonsense that came into his head. Yes, Boris had had a bit of a brain freeze when he had negotiated the withdrawal agreement and it was a bit shit but everyone was entitled to a bit of an off-day. The Brexit deal had never made complete sense so it was only right that the Boris should try to tie up a few loose ends by ignoring something that had been agreed both by the UK and the EU. But people shouldn't be too quick to pre-judge the situation. Just wait until Wednesday when the government published its new get-out-of-jail internal market bill and see if the EU was still complaining then. Clue: it would be. As would almost everyone else. What followed was a near-universal pile on from both sides of the house, with only Iain Duncan Smith, John Redwood and Steve Baker rushing to Lewis's defence. The kind of support Lewis could have done without as all three seemed to imply that Boris had promised them last year that he would renege on the Northern Ireland protocol, which was the only reason they had voted for it in the first place. Besides, it was vital that the UK could continue to offer state aid to tech companies, such as the one that had delivered the 'world-beating'test and trace coronavirus app. By the end Lewis was all but begging them to shut up. Theresa May was first to go on the attack. The UK had signed the protocol and it was our duty to abide by it. What would be the consequences for any other international treaties if the UK could not be trusted to keep its word? We would be no better than any of the other failed, rogue states the UK was always so quick to deplore for doing the same thing. Tory Simon Hoare made much the same point, as did a host of opposition MPs. Labour's Hilary Benn wondered how the customs paperwork would operate under the proposed new regime. Lewis clearly didn't have a clue. By just throwing it in the bin, he shrugged? Eventually Brandon cracked. Asked yet again, this time by Tory Bob Neill, if the government was planning to break international law, Lewis made the schoolboy error of giving an almost honest response. Yes, of course we would be breaking the law, he snapped. But we would only be doing it in a little way and not so much that anyone would notice. It would be no worse than doing a little, gentle recreational shoplifting after school. All shops priced in a bit of pilfering to their balance sheet so there would be no harm done. It wasn't as if we were planning to nuke Brussels. Though Boris might like to keep that option on the table. With this the floodgates opened. It was normal for ministers to lie at the dispatch box. MPs expected nothing else. So if Lewis had actually told a half-truth, then the reality must be even worse than they had thought. Was all this actually just a ploy to piss off the EU so much that we ended up saying sod the Good Friday agreement and having a no-deal Brexit? Lewis opened and closed his mouth, but no words came out. ",0.25,Positive
Who says Britain can't negotiate a Brexit deal? We've got Frosty the No Man,0,Neutral,"Right at the start of Gladiator, there's a bit where Russell Crowe's forces are waiting for the return of the negotiator they've sent to do a deal with the barbarians. The negotiator's horse is heard returning, leading to a brief soar in hopes, before Maximus Crowe observes its rider is now headless. Correctly parsing this nuanced negotiating gambit, he judges: 'They say no.'Spoiler 1: thereafter, it doesn't end well for the barbarians. Spoiler 2: even though I can exclusively reveal that UK prime minister Boris Johnson knows Latin, his government does not take the role of the Roman army in this Brexit negotiations analogy. Anyway, hold on to your nappies, because it's yet another crunch week in the Brexit we apparently got done eight months ago. This morning the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, arrived in London for a crucial round of trade talks. After a weekend of no-deal sabre-rattling, Barnier would have been expecting the usual British threats to walk away/relieve him of his head. However, in a change to our scheduled programming, the government is also now affecting not to understand the Brexit deal it has already signed, and will reportedly seek to override it in an internal market bill to be published on Wednesday. According to the splash on Johnson's OnlyFans account (the Daily Telegraph), his government will tell the EU that it was simply 'unforeseen'that its own deal could leave Northern Ireland isolated from the rest of the UK. This has gone down about as well as one might have foreseen in Northern Ireland, a country currently part of the UK, and which the Westminster government seems to think enjoys painful uncertainty. 'Brexit deal never made sense,'runs the Telegraph headline ascribed to the prime minister who negotiated it, then made it the centrepiece of his entire election campaign. Well quite. Who could possibly have predicted this, much less loudly and at very great length at the time? Johnson's promise that his Brexit deal was 'oven ready'carried all the conviction of the minicab operator telling you 'he's just pulling into your road now'ù. (Translation: he's in Rio and hasn't yet passed his driving test.) Speaking of changes to our scheduled programming, there's just been another one. As I was typing the previous paragraph, Brandon Lewis announced to the Commons that the government would indeed be breaking international law - 'but in a very specific and limited way'ù. This morning, it emerged that Jonathan Jones, the head of the government's legal department, had resigned over this Downing Street plan to row back on aspects of the withdrawal agreement, presumably regarding respect for international law as a bit of a dealbreaker. Responsibility for upholding the law rests with '¶ hang on, let me get my reading glasses on '¶ ah: attorney general and leading invertebrate Suella Braverman. So it's impossible to foresee how this one will play out. Elsewhere there are suggestions that the UK is acting like a toddler in its dealings with the EU, which feels unfair. Toddlers are famously incredible negotiators. Our negotiator, meanwhile, is David Frost, whose Downing Street call sign is 'Frosty'ù. Are you familiar with David? He has the look of a Guildford-based Jaguar dealer prepared to pull the kids out of private school to fund his court battle against his ex-wife. ('Let's see how she likes that.'ù) To be clear, the above was just a fantasy sequence. In real life, Frosty the No Man cites his inspo as Charles de Gaulle, who he says 'always behaved as if his country was a great country even when it seemed to have fallen very low, and thus made it become a great country yet again.'This was certainly true of De Gaulle, who infuriated rather a lot of his own allies - including Churchill - with this type of posturing. As Julian Jackson remarks in his biography of the general: 'Behaving like a great power was De Gaulle's way of becoming one.'Unfortunately, Britain is not behaving like a great power, despite cheerleaders such as the Daily Express describing some nonsense wheeze of Iain Duncan Smith's as a 'new ace up Britain's sleeve'- a metaphor that simply confirms the UK is a country that cheats at cards. The best you could say is that Britain is behaving like Donald Trump, and it is certainly a matter of opinion how great again he has made America. Lying, reneging, then lying about the lies you told: these tactics might get you out of a hole in the short term, and your supporters might even cheer you for it. But ultimately, they corrode public life to the point where it is widely believed that there are no objective facts at all, and that all news is fake. As can be seen from Russia to America, this harms people on all sides of any political divide, and betrays every citizen governed by people who choose to indulge in it. Still, on we go. This time last year an apparently discombobulated Johnson was rolled onstage at a police academy, where he eventually remembered to gibber out his prepared line, a promise that he'd 'rather be dead in a ditch than delay Brexit'ù. The next month, he delayed it. And there is, for many, an evens chance that he'll do the same again, and agree some face-saving deal at the last minute. And look, no one is saying that negotiating has ever been a solely noble calling, and there's certainly nothing unusual in treating it as a down-and-dirty art. Take the entertainment industry. Any history of its greatest dealmakers will introduce you to some of the most enormous, most unreasonable and most unscrupulous shitbirds ever to stalk the Earth, whose insistence on wildly overplaying their hand absolutely every time usually results in more refined and dignified opponents becoming too exhausted not to capitulate. As I'm sure Frosty likes to tell the reflection in his bathroom mirror: it's called showbusiness, not showfriends. So let's just hope he's our Louis B Mayer, our Peter Grant, our Michael Ovitz. And not just some guy poking his finger through his jacket and hissing, 'Don't move! I've got a gun.'Hand on heart, though, I'm not sure that the other David (Geffen) ever pretended not to understand one of his own deals in order to unpick it later and get a better one. But either way, setting ourselves up as the country you really can't trust seems an eccentric way to launch a new era of global dealmaking. I know some on the UK government's side have long sought to characterise these negotiations as the righteous Jedi (them) versus the nefarious Trade Federation (the EU). But this has long indicated that the Star Wars franchise is just one more thing they don't understand. If Johnson really does carry on at this rate, it will be akin to the Emperor demonstrating the Death Star is a fully operational battle station by blowing itself up instead of Alderaan. See, you idiots! I told you we weren't bluffing! '¢ Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist '¢ Join the Guardian live event tomorrow, Are we heading for a no-deal Brexit?

Brexit: Boris Johnson to override EU withdrawal agreement,0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson is drawing up legislation that will override the Brexit withdrawal agreement on Northern Ireland, a move that threatens the collapse of crunch talks which the prime minister has said must be completed within five weeks. Johnson will put an ultimatum to negotiators this week, saying the UK and Europe must agree a post-Brexit trade deal by 15 October or Britain will walk away for good.  But progress on the already fragile talks will be threatened by plans revealed on Sunday for the UK government to publish a controversial section of the internal market bill on Wednesday that will intentionally try to unpick parts of the withdrawal agreement signed in January. It will include elements of the special arrangements for Northern Ireland that are legally binding. A UK government source told the Guardian the plan was part of the preparation for a no-deal exit that would present a number of new barriers to trade from Northern Ireland - and accepted that the move was likely to blow up at the negotiations this week. Labour said the prime minister was 'threatening to renege on the UK's legal obligations'and called it 'an act of immense bad faith: one that would be viewed dimly by future trading partners and allies around the world'ù. The news was condemned by Ireland's foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, who helped broker the original Brexit settlement. He said any change would be 'very unwise'ù. This would be a very unwise way to proceed. #Brexit .  https://t.co/D4aod2665h The move, first reported by the Financial Times, would row back parts of the UK's agreement with the EU on state aid and customs arrangements for Northern Ireland. It is understood that the UK government believes the original protocol is drafted ambiguously enough to allow for a change of interpretation - a view likely to be fiercely contested by Brussels. A government spokesperson said it was hopeful that a deal could still be reached. 'As a responsible government, we are considering fall-back options in the event this is not achieved, to ensure the communities of Northern Ireland are protected.'Key figures close to the negotiations have already warned that EU leaders and heads of state must intervene before the end of the month to save the talks from collapse. On Monday, the prime minister will set a firm deadline of 15 October - the date of the European council - for a deal to be signed, with the mood bleak as formal talks resume this week between the UK's lead negotiator, David Frost, and the EU's Michel Barnier.  If no agreement is reached before the deadline, the UK will 'move on'and accept that a deal cannot be struck, Johnson will say, adding that no deal would be a 'good outcome'ù. The prime minister will strike a belligerent tone, suggesting there will be no movement from the deadline and claiming the UK is ready to trade on World Trade Organization terms from January. 'There is no sense in thinking about timelines that go beyond that point,'he will say. 'If we can't agree by then, then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on.'Johnson and his allies have repeatedly said they did not believe earlier negotiations made the threat of no deal tangible enough. EU officials had previously said the deadline would be the end of October. Sources close to the talks have suggested fresh faces and interventions by member states are now needed to break the impasse after days of recriminations. Raoul Ruparel, one of the leading advisers in Theresa May's Brexit negotiating team, suggested the dynamics needed to change. 'It is just Frost and Barnier and the same teams in talks; you've got two immovable objects sitting down again and you are not going to see great movement coming from that,'he said. 'There needs to be some change, some sort of fresh input, political input '¶ If we come to the end of the year and we don't have a deal between two close allies, that would look ridiculous, but with the two sides entrenched, where the mechanism is for unlocking the talks is not obvious.'Johnson will characterise the result of no deal as a 'a trading arrangement with the EU like Australia's'ù, saying the UK would have full control of its laws and fishing waters and would 'prosper mightily as a result'ù. He will say the UK would find 'sensible accommodations on practical issues such as flights, lorry transport, or scientific cooperation, if the EU wants to do that.'Industry leaders have previously said no deal would spell disaster for the country, with tariffs imposed on goods sending costs for industry and consumers soaring. Last week an LSE economics professor, Thomas Sampson, said no deal could cost more than the economic shock of Covid, causing a £3.3tn decline in the value of the UK's output. Johnson will say negotiators will continue to work hard to try to close a deal. 'Even at this late stage, if the EU are ready to rethink their current positions and agree this, I will be delighted. But we cannot and will not compromise on the fundamentals of what it means to be an independent country to get it.'There are worries that European leaders, preoccupied with the Covid-19 recovery plan and foreign policy crises in Belarus and the eastern Mediterranean, appear to have no appetite to intervene in Brexit talks for now. There remain three stumbling blocks: state aid, fisheries and governance. The EU has protested that the UK is refusing to put forward proposals, while the UK is accusing Barnier of trying to force it to cut a deal on the 'difficult'areas first and failing to engage on easier challenges such as fishing rights. While some national capitals favour a tougher negotiating stance than the one being pursued by Barnier, they appear content to leave the talks in his hands, fuelling fears that there will be no deal if back channels are not created to test new ideas in confidence. One UK government source said member state engagement had been minimal, but more direct approaches with EU leaders could be imminent. 'Our broad view has been that will come in the next few weeks,'the source said. 'The nature of these negotiations is that bigger players will start to get involved when we reach the final stages.'The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that the Brexit negotiations were approaching a 'moment of reckoning'and that a deal was 'there for the taking'ù. UK officials are keen to start technical work on the bulk of the trade agreement on goods and services, for example on service schedules. 'If we can't start talking about legal texts this week, it is going to be difficult to get all the work done in the time available,'a UK official said. A last-minute political intervention would be high-risk, say EU sources. 'Ursula von der Leyen isn't as interested in Brexit as [Jean-Claude] Juncker was,'the source said, referring to the European commission president and her predecessor. 'You get the impression she just wants to move on and the same for any member states.'Fears that talks were on the verge of collapse were heightened in the last 24 hours after Frost said the government was not 'scared'of walking away. His remarks in the Mail on Sunday led to recriminations, with May's former chief of staff Gavin Barwell saying Frost had a 'brass neck'ù. ",-0.375,Negative
Red wall voters are sticking with Boris Johnson (for now),0,Neutral,"Like many, I was sceptical on hearing that the Tories had the 'red wall'- dozens of long-held Labour constituencies stretching through the Midlands up to the north - in their sights. Perceptions of the Tory brand had changed little in decades of listening to voters. A typical Tory was 'upper class'ù. He - and yes, it almost certainly was a 'he'ù, even when the Conservative prime minister was a woman - worked in finance, read the Times and wore a pinstripe suit. I had asked focus groups to imagine his Come Dine with Me signature dish. It was the poshest food they could dream up: quail or pheasant washed down by a costly vintage wine. How could working-class voters from those run-down, post-industrial towns ever bring themselves to vote Tory? It seemed unimaginable, and yet, on 12 December 2019, seat after seat fell in Labour's red wall. I set out to find out why. The interviews and focus groups for my book, Beyond the Red Wall, were held in early 2020 in Hyndburn, Stoke, and Darlington. They confirmed a settled and negative view of the Tory brand. 'I always thought the Tories were snobby,'pronounced Tracy, a carer, from Accrington. 'Snobbish, corporate and arrogant,'agreed retired mechanic Andy. 'Self-centred, rich and privileged,'declared Jean, a healthcare worker from Stoke. Yet, these voters, typically poorly paid manual workers, had all turned up to tell me why they had voted Tory for the first time. Longstanding disillusionment with Labour was part of their story, as was Brexit (a majority of red wallers voted Leave). But the single most important determinant was, as it always is, the party leader. As one voter put it: 'Boris has de-snobbified the Tories.'Johnson had given her a licence to vote Conservative for the first time. He had stood out as different: 'focused and determined'to resolve the 'Brexit mess'ù. 'Get Brexit done'had a clarity that appealed even to Remain-voting red wallers who, it seemed, now simply wanted it all to be over. This, they believed, demonstrated how well he understood what they wanted. Still unpersuaded, I pressed them: 'Could an Old Etonian ever really relate to people from such different backgrounds?'The answer was clear: his warmth and positivity told them he 'liked people'(oddly unusual for a politician). His somewhat chaotic spontaneity signalled that, even if born posh, he was authentic and down-to-earth. Most of all, though, it was his optimistic patriotism that shone through. 'He's like a light at the end of the tunnel,'said Sue, a shopworker from Darlington. 'He believes in Britain and that makes you want to believe in him.'When the unexpected - in the shape of Covid-19 - happened, initially Johnson's ratings sky-rocketed. The nation came together with wartime spirit, but then came a rocky few weeks of PPE shortages, testing mishaps and Dominic Cummings' trip to Barnard Castle. I recontacted some of my interviewees to see if their views had changed. Their first response was always defensive: 'They've done as good a job as they could in difficult circumstances,'Yvonne, from Darlington told me, while Michelle, who runs a sandwich shop in Accrington, was just relieved she didn't have to do the PM's job. However, as discussions dug deeper, the disappointment was palpable. Karen from Stoke said: 'I loved that he was very clear. Firm and assertive.

Ian, a plumber from Accrington, summed it up: 'I don't know what he [Starmer] is about yet. Meanwhile I see Boris clearly. For all his flaws, I get him.

The useful idiots of Brexit only make us less secure,-0.125,Negative,"When Brexit happens, 'the EU will no longer exist'ù. So said Nigel Farage to Michel Barnier, who was to become the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, a few days after the 2016 referendum. Barnier revealed this recently at the end of an interview with the French journalist Marion van Renterghem, about which she writes in the current issue of the New European. Farage could hardly have been more wrong, but it was typical of that mountebank and his Brexit gang. The Brexiters assured the innocents who were naive enough to believe them that dealing with our partners in the rest of the EU would be a cakewalk, and that during their negotiations about a post-Brexit 'deal'the UK would be able to have that cake they were walking towards and eat it. Yes, fantasists such as Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and the dreaded 'Eyetest'Cummings fooled people - possibly including themselves - that they could 'take back control'while retaining all the advantages of the single market - the single market that was one of their heroine Margaret Thatcher's proudest achievements. But that was just convenient lying propaganda. As the impasse in the so-called Brexit 'negotiations'demonstrates, if you renege on your referendum campaign promises and insist on leaving the customs union and the single market - hey presto, you lose the advantages of membership. Throughout these fruitless talks, the Brexiters have complained about the 'unreasonable'attitude of the rest of the EU. They somehow thought they would have formidable bargaining power even though, if you are resigning from a club, you are in a pathetically weak position about your future relationship. As for those extreme Brexiters like Farage, who wanted the EU to break up, they have found that, on the contrary, the prospect of Brexit has brought the rest of the EU closer together. As Barnier said: 'We need to stay together to defend our interests in the world, without shame. Neither the Chinese, nor the Russians, nor the Americans have shame when defending theirs.'For Brexit is not only about a once-proud nation volunteering to suffer wholly needless and avoidable economic self-harm; it is also about weakening your country in a world where the geopolitical rivalry between the US, Russia and China is becoming ever more menacing. As Barnier says: 'The single market is one of the rare reasons why President Trump and Xi Jinping respect us. It is an ecosystem that we have been building for 60 years - with the British.'(My italics.) It follows that it is no surprise that the world leaders who are the main non-British cheerleaders for Brexit are, you have guessed it, Putin (especially), Trump and Xi. They are already trying hard enough to disrupt European power and unity. They can hardly believe their luck when the Brexiters - the enemy within - join in to help them. What was that phrase in Soviet times? Yes: useful idiots. But back to the economy. It is a time for black humour. We find that, in the Brexit-voting area of Kent - Dover, Ashford and environs - they suddenly find that contingency plans for guaranteed lorry hold-ups in the event of the impending end-year Brexit, and guaranteed much bigger hold-ups in the event of a no-deal as well, are disrupting the local landscape so that parking space can be provided for held-up lorries. I love the quote in the New York Times from Douglas Bannister, chief executive of the port of Dover: 'I am very, very confident that there will be no disruption on January 1st, primarily because it's a bank holiday. But January 2nd may be a different question.'And this is being imposed on an economy that will still be struggling with the repercussions of lockdown and, God help us, the possibility of a second wave of the virus. In which context, I am not sure that Chancellor Sunak is wise to talk up the need for tax increases when the economic recovery is far from well-based. Has he learned nothing from the folly of George 'Austerity'Osborne's clampdown on the fragile economic recovery he inherited from prime minister Brown and chancellor Darling in 2010? And another thing: can Sunak really still be a Brexiter? Has he not been listening to those wise Treasury officials who know a disaster when they see one? ",0,Neutral
Labour urges UK government not to hire Tony Abbott as trade envoy,-0.125,Negative,"The UK government is facing increased pressure over its proposed appointment of Tony Abbott as a trade envoy because of his views about women, equal marriage and climate change, with Labour calling for the idea to be scrapped. 'I have real concerns about Tony Abbott and don't think he's the right person for the job,'Keir Starmer said in a TV clip. 'And if I was prime minister I wouldn't appoint him.'The Labour leader's comments come after Matt Hancock, the health secretary, expressed some apparent discomfort at the appointment, declining to endorse the former Australian prime minister's views. Later, the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, was chastised in the Commons by the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, for refusing twice to engage with questions from Labour about Abbott's suitability. The government has yet to confirm that Abbott is to be appointed to the Board of Trade to help with post-Brexit trade deals, but has also not denied this will happen. Abbott's attitudes to women, including describing abortion as 'the easy way out'and suggesting men are better adapted than women to exercise authority, made international headlines in 2012 when the then-Australian PM, Julia Gillard, used a widely shared speech in parliament to castigate his views. He has also suggested climate change is 'probably doing good'ù, and likened policies to combat it to 'primitive people once killing goats to appease the volcano gods'ù. Asked about the criticisms of Abbott's views, Boris Johnson's spokesman declined to comment, saying: 'No decisions on the Board of Trade have been made.'Answering trade questions in the Commons, Truss, who is also the minister for women and equalities, refused to answer questions from two Labour MPs on Abbott's views. Asked by Ruth Cadbury about his apparent misogyny, Truss instead talked about Labour's 'absolute hypocrisy'given previous comment by Labour MPs and the fact it had never had a female leader, saying the party would 'rather virtue signal and indulge in tokenism rather than take real action to improve the lives of women'ù. When Christian Matheson asked whether Abbott's climate change scepticism meant this would not be a focus for future trade deals, Truss again evaded the question, instead calling those on the left 'intolerant of anyone who doesn't agree with them, but are prepared to defend anything from their own friends'ù. This brought a reprimand from Hoyle, who told Truss: 'I think we've got to remember we actually answer questions rather than keep asking them.'Questioned earlier on Abbott's views during a TV interview, Hancock stressed the former PM's 'huge amount of expertise'in international trade but repeatedly cited his own contrasting opinions on areas like equal marriage. Asked whether he believed Abbott was a 'fit and proper'person to take on an official UK role, Hancock declined to concur. He told Sky News: 'I think the best thing to say is that I am totally focused on the coronavirus crisis and the future of the NHS and social care. That is my area. I do know that Mr Abbott is very good and very experienced in trade.''Is Tony Abbott the right person to represent us - even if he's a homophobic misogynist?' - @KayBurleyHealth Secretary @MattHancock says the former Australian PM is ""also an expert in trade"" and denies the claims.Follow #KayBurley live: https://t.co/Qj88d3ncEp pic.twitter.com/ELhm8PzXAo At one point Hancock did disagree with the idea that Abbott was a 'homophobic misogynist'ù, saying: 'I don't think that's true.'But when some of the former PM's views were put to him, Hancock added: 'He's also an expert in trade.'Hancock argued that the main issue in appointing Abbott was his experience in trade: 'As far as I understand it, the proposal is that Mr Abbott supports the UK on trade policy, which is an area in which he has a huge amount of expertise. I bow to nobody in my support of everybody to love who they love, whoever that is. 'But we need to have the best experts in the world, working in their field, and as the former prime minister of Australia, obviously Mr Abbott has got a huge amount of experience.'Asked if his trade expertise negated his views, Hancock said: 'What I'm saying is that we need experts in different areas, and the former prime minister of Australia is, obviously, an enormous expert in the field of trade. It doesn't change my views.'Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said Abbott's coronavirus views were 'deeply offensive and wrong'and he was not fit to be a trade envoy. 'But Tony Abbott, before these comments, is a misogynist, he's a sexist, he's a climate-change denier,'she told Sky News. ",0,Neutral
Tony Abbott's proposed job as the UK's hired gun on trade is a baffling choice,0,Neutral,"The appointment of former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott as a British trade envoy is not quite treason but certainly a further sign he has London written on his heart. That is where Abbott was born in 1957. He went from Australia to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and remains a royalist who as prime minister gave the Duke of Edinburgh an Australian knighthood. The bestowal baffled many Australians who couldn't see what services to them warranted a tribute to a prince already overloaded with gongs. But Abbott was keen to do what British PMs could and dispense royal rewards. And he probably wouldn't reject a display of royal approval himself, should his services rendered to trade negotiation be worthy of honour. Perhaps he has been chatting to Sir Lynton Crosby. Abbott's hero is Sir Winston Churchill. Like Churchill he has striven to be a journalist, a prime minister and a soldier. Well, he has had to be content with two out of three as the military career is a no-show. This British trade job would set a new mark of Australian politicians signing on to British employment. Australia's fourth prime minister, George Reid, served also in the House of Commons, and subsequent prime ministers Stanley Bruce and Robert Menzies were in Churchill's war cabinet. But there has been nothing like the hired-gun status of Abbott's proposed job - part government member, part consultant - and the obvious way it could damage Australia's trade aspirations. The particularly baffling element of this Boris Johnson proposal stems from the public record showing Abbott is not a negotiator or salesman. His lack of sales craft is exposed by the fact he was sacked by his own party as prime minister in 2015, and by his local constituents as an MP in 2019. Certainly he won the prime ministership, but it was from a Labor party which had changed leaders three times in six years. The ALP was begging to be defeated. Abbott is the hairy-chested variety of deal maker, preferring bulldozer tactics to finesse. And he's not very good at that either, as one notorious episode underlines. In July 2014 a missile supplied to Ukraine rebels by Russia brought down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, killing all 298 on board, including 38 Australians. Abbott was quite rightly outraged and in October that year promised a confrontation with Russian president Vladimir Putin on the atrocity. He told reporters in a state of such excitement he mangled his wording: 'Look, I'm going to shirtfront Mr Putin, you bet you are ... you bet I am.'A shirtfront is an Australian rules football tackle in which the attacker's shoulder is driven into the chest of the defender. Despite the bluster, the Putin shirtfront remained undefined, and the Russian leader - himself a practiced hand at bulldozer diplomacy - even seemed amused. Australia's former foreign minister Julie Bishop revealed in October 2018 that a few years after the Abbott threat she cornered Putin on another matter at a summit. She reported: 'His eyes never left my face, and they are piercing blue eyes, and then he said, 'òSo this is what you call a shirtfront?''Abbott is not a student of global affairs outside a pining for the return of the British empire and a grateful commonwealth of nations. A highly articulate and well-read man, these qualities sometime fail him when it comes to international matters. In one interview as leader of his Liberal party, he suggested Canadians came from 'Canadia'ù, a country only he knew of. His defenders note that during his two years as PM Australia secured free trade agreements with China, Japan and South Korea. However, it can be argued that had more to do with good timing than any substantial contribution from him. But an even bigger problem for Johnson is that Abbott almost invariably picks the wrong side, even when he wins. In 1999 he was prominent in the referendum 'òno' campaign for a move to a republic, and it was knocked back by close to 55% of voters. However, close to the same proportion of voters in his electorate of Warringah, a plush part of Sydney, voted yes. In 2017 Abbott again was at the front of the no campaign at a plebiscite asking voters to back legislation allowing same-sex marriage. This time the national vote rejected the Abbott position, as did 75% of the voters in Warringah. Abbott has long declined to accept the science of human-created climate change, and was behind a small but effective group of rebels who hobbled attempts by conservative governments to deal effectively with the issue. In the May 2019 election he was defeated in Warringah by an independent candidate who backed greater action on climate change. One of Abbott's many attempts to discredit Labor's climate policies highlighted his other problem area - women. 'What the housewives of Australia need to understand as they do the ironing is that if they get it done commercially it's going to go up in price, and their own power bills, when they switch the iron on, are going to go up,'he told reporters. The notion only wives ironed led to some rushed picture opportunities of Abbott flattening creases in his own shirts. He barely survived that but would not spin his way out of a confrontation, while he was opposition leader, with Labor prime minister Julia Gillard, who fiercely challenged his claims she played 'the gender card'ù. In a speech to parliament in October 2012 - subsequently applauded globally - Gillard took him on. 'And in doing so I say to the leader of the opposition I will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man,'she said. 'And the government will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man. Not now, not ever.'Tony Abbott clearly believes he, and his personal history, will fit in nicely in Boris Johnson's Britain. '¢ Malcolm Farr is an Australian political journalist ",-0.625,Negative
EU trade chief faces fresh criticism over breaking Covid rules in Ireland,-0.5,Negative,"The embattled European trade commissioner Phil Hogan is facing fresh accusations that he flouted coronavirus regulations during a golfing break in Ireland. Hogan attempted to douse the controversy and save his job in a media interview on Tuesday evening, but ended up tacitly admitting he had violated quarantine rules, triggering more questions and calls for his resignation. Earlier on Tuesday he published a timeline of his movements in Ireland from 31 July to 22 August and gave around 20 pages of documents with additional details to the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. She is under pressure to sack Hogan, an Irish political veteran who moved to Brussels and is the EU's key figure in Brexit talks, but doing so would set an awkward precedent. The row erupted after it emerged Hogan joined more than 8o people, including politicians and a supreme court judge, at a golfing dinner in Clifden, county Galway, on 19 August. The event breached Covid-19 regulations and prompted a public outcry that continues to swell. Several attendees resigned from their positions, including Dara Calleary, the government's agriculture minister. Police are investigating the event. Hogan apologised, saying the gathering was wrong and he should not have attended, but he has refused to resign, insisting he respected regulations during the rest of his three-week visit to Ireland. Drip-drip disclosures, however, have undermined that claim. In Tuesday's interview - his first since the affair broke - Hogan told RTE he had made big mistakes and was very embarrassed, but again insisted he had broken no rules. He said he had arrived in Ireland on 31 July and travelled to his temporary residence in county Kildare before being admitted on 5 August to a Dublin hospital, where he tested negative for Covid-19 before being discharged on 7 August. He returned to Kildare, which was under lockdown because of a surge in infections, and over the next two weeks visited counties Limerick, Roscommon, Kilkenny and Galway before returning to Brussels. 'I am satisfied arising from the test that I did that proved it was negative that I was no risk to anybody,'Hogan said. Told by RTE's interviewer, Tony Connolly, that as a traveller from Belgium, a high risk country, rules state he should have remained in self-isolation even after a negative test, Hogan said: 'Well I don't accept that.'The department of health later confirmed that a person must restrict their movements for 14 days if they travel from a country not on Ireland's green list. Belgium is not on it. Last week a commission spokesman claimed Hogan had completed his quarantine in Kilkenny. That unravelled when the police notified the government that a Garda stopped and cautioned Hogan for using his mobile phone while driving in Kildare. Hogan told RTE he was exempt from Kildare's lockdown restrictions because of essential work negotiating tariff reductions with the US, and he had needed to collect handwritten notes at his residence. Asked whether this was an effort to mask a golfing holiday, Hogan said he was able to organise his outings to make sure he had time to work in the evenings. The leaders of Ireland's three ruling parties, Fianna F√°il, Fine Gael and the Greens, issued a statement welcoming Hogan's apology but said it was clear he had breached public health guidelines: 'People are correctly angered by these actions given the sacrifices so many have made to adhere to public health guidance. In addition, his delayed and hesitant release of information has undermined public confidence.'Sinn FÈin, Ireland's main opposition party, called for Hogan to be sacked. ",0,Neutral

The Covid-19 crisis is accelerating the breakup of the UK,-0.125,Negative,"Covid-19 is a great accelerator. In most of the countries it has struck, whatever inequalities, divisions and tensions were festering before its arrival have now sped into the political foreground. And so it has proved here. Race, class, gender, poverty, wealth, the north-south divide - even though it often feels it as if time has stood still, all of these things are now vividly in front of us, demanding attention. And one key issue has come roaring back: the fate of the United Kingdom itself. Brexit and the pandemic are pushing its countries and regions in strikingly different directions. Clearly, nothing highlights our increasingly unsettled, estranged national condition better than the politics of Scotland. One should always hesitate before claiming that mere polls represent historic shifts, but in the last few months, a number of surveys have found support for Scottish independence running at more than 50%. Leaving aside undecideds, a Panelbase poll last week put the for-and-against numbers at 55 and 45 respectively: an elegant inversion of the 2014 referendum result, and another excuse for stories about political shockwaves supposedly now spreading from Edinburgh to London. The superficial explanation is obvious. As one Tory put it to me last week, Nicola Sturgeon has succeeded in creating a contrast between her government's 'cautious and communitarian'approach to Covid-19 and the idea that Boris Johnson's administration has been 'chaotic and market-driven'ù. As the UK government has lurched from crisis to crisis, she has presented an image of grown-up competence - even if, as evidenced by Scotland's exam results fiasco, an image is sometimes all it is. Brexit is also central to what is happening, not least in the sense that remain-voting Scots who backed the union six years ago have decided that independence is now the better option. Elections to the Scottish parliament will take place in May 2021. Even if the Scottish National party has done surprisingly little with its 13 years in power, and governs in a narrow, cliqueish fashion, the most recent poll on voting intentions for Holyrood found 57% of the electorate planning to support Sturgeon and her party in the constituency vote, and the SNP heading for an outright majority. The Johnson government still insists that it will not countenance another referendum on independence, certainly not during the current parliament. But the current situation seems to point in one direction: towards a potentially historic showdown, and the fissures decisively opened in 2014 becoming unmendable. For some of us in England, independence for Scotland is still a fascinating and exciting prospect. The idea may be laced with anxiety about what exactly it would mean for politics in our home country, but it also highlights basic notions of democracy and self-determination, and suggests a realistic chance for a modern kind of left politics that could jump away from cruel, reckless economic liberalism and the lunacies and nastiness of Brexit. From a more dispassionate perspective, what seems remarkable is that the increasing possibility of an end of the union has yet to enter England's political conversation, on left or right. A sense of ignorance and complacency may go right to the top. According to a recent report in the Financial Times, Michael Gove recently warned the cabinet of the seriousness of the situation and outlined ideas about how to pull Scotland back, and the first minister to respond was Rishi Sunak. 'I now understand why this is so important,'he said. An odd thing for a holder of one of the great offices of state to say, but there we are. Sleepwalking is one aspect of the English approach to the union; the other is a biting hostility, which mirrors some of the uglier aspects of Scottish separatism. A vocal part of English opinion still imagines Scotland to be a place full of entitlement and unjustified grievances, and therefore best let go - a belief cynically encouraged by David Cameron and George Osborne in the election campaign of 2015, when they pushed the idea that Labour might go into coalition with the SNP, and signed off billboards featuring Alex Salmond with the caption 'Don't let the SNP grab your cash'ù. In June last year, let us not forget, a briefly infamous survey found that 63% of Conservative party members agreed that Scottish or Northern Irish secession was a price worth paying for our exit from the European Union. Brexity patriotism is a strange thing: always clad in the union jack but so defined by a crazed and zealous Englishness that it embraces a surreal contradiction: that in pursuit of a supposedly reborn United Kingdom, the UK itself can be written off as collateral damage. For now at least, this is more the stuff of emotion than practical politics - and even if it still festers in the Tories' collective soul, given that the end of the UK would surely spell the fall of Johnson and his ministers, the government wants nothing to do with it. When I spoke to a senior Conservative minister last week, they acknowledged the gravity and urgency of the current situation, and outlined roughly what they may try to do next year. Even if the SNP won by a landslide, recession and a lingering pandemic would perhaps allow the government to play for time ('The question would be, 'òDo you want to call a referendum now?' I don't think Sturgeon would want to'ù) while it tried to re-emphasise the kind of cultural argument voiced in 2014 by Gordon Brown - that people should not be forced to choose between Scottishness and their place in the UK. Much would be made of steps Westminster had taken to fight the worst effects of the pandemic, such as Sunak's furlough scheme. If the debate carried on for another two or three years, this source reckoned, tensions over Brexit might by then have receded, along with the idea of the EU as an 'easy cushion into which you could rest'if an independent Scotland instantly faced big fiscal and economic challenges. Whatever these arguments look like on paper, as Johnson holidays in Scotland and ministers are dispatched on PR trips, the idea of the government styling itself as the union's great defender sits rather awkwardly with a plain fact. However much Tory voices may try to portray independence as a fiendish conspiracy worked up by the SNP, they and their party have played a huge role in weakening the union, and continue to do so. Labour also has a case to answer - about the hatchet-faced, factional, macho politics that it embedded in Scotland over decades, and the fall into disgrace of the Blair government, not least on Iraq. But from the miners' strike, through the poll tax to the bedroom tax, it has been Tory actions and aggressions that have most outraged Scots. By 1987 - 33 long years ago - the Conservatives were down to only 10 MPs in Scotland; a decade later, they had none at all. To have even tried to rebuild any meaningful legitimacy would have required an emollient, open, progressive kind of Conservatism - to some extent, the kind of politics belatedly tried by the former leader of the Scottish Tories, Ruth Davidson. But in retrospect, Brexit killed that prospect, and now far too much of what the Tories do threatens to only deepen Scotland's estrangement from Westminster. All this makes for a mixed-up and confusing political stew. Wreckers of the union are now desperately trying to save it, while the effects of the pandemic could conceivably fall in two contradictory directions - fomenting change but also convincing some people that in times as turbulent as these, the status quo remains the safest bet. So far, only one thing is crystal clear: that even as England dozes, British politics is now brimming with fundamental issues, and the fate of the UK will sooner or later prove to be the most fundamental of all.

"First, private equity holds us to ransom. Now it wants us to bail out its losses",-0.625,Negative,"It could be your local Pizza Express, the home caring for a cherished relative, your favourite supermarket, even the sports tournaments you love. They are all ventures owned not by their founders or a company quoted on a public stock exchange. They are in the hands of a new class of invisible investors who mortgage companies for self-enrichment, rather as homebuyers mortgage themselves to buy homes. But while homebuyers hope for a general rise in house prices to increase the value of their initial equity, the invisibles do everything in their power to make the mortgaged company look super-profitable - and then sell it on for a handsome return. This 'mortgage the company and flip it'industry is called private equity and it has become the fastest growing, richest and most influential business in the UK, in turn the centre of European private equity. But last week, we learned, courtesy of the Financial Times, that the foundational privacy it so prizes and that has allowed, via tax havens, excessive remuneration and freedom from employee and shareholder accountability, some of its leaders to become the wealthiest on the planet, has risks it does not like. Its excessive debts, once the route to fortunes and, it would say, 'business discipline'ù, are crushing it. On top, the commercial property market no longer looks a one-way bet. It wants its vast mortgage debt guaranteed by the government, even though the interest charges drive the underlying companies into operating losses. Otherwise they will lay off hundreds of thousands of people to save their own skins. Fearing an unemployment crisis this autumn, it seems the government will buckle. It is looking at ways around EU rules that forbid such intervention. Indeed, the Brexit negotiations are partly stalled over the issue. Britain wants the freedom, post-Brexit, to bankroll private equity billionaires. The EU is insisting that if Britain wants a trade deal, it had better continue respecting its rules on state aid. The talks are deadlocked. For private equity has emerged as not just a British but a pan-European phenomenon, of which increasingly hard questions are being asked, especially in the wake of the coronavirus. So the death of Zoilo Pati√±o, an 84-year-old with Alzheimer's, of Covid-19 in a Madrid care home owned by the government became a national talking point in Spain in March. His body was found 24 hours after his death in a locked room, even as the elderly were being 'abandoned, if not dead, on their beds'ù, as one Spanish minister said. The subsequent investigation into the management company - DomusVi, which had been contracted to operate the home - showed it had been stripped down to a 'fast-food version'of healthcare by years of cuts: there was only one care worker for every 10 residents, with not even the PPE to help cope with a dead body. But DomusVi, Spain's largest care home company, is owned by the British private equity company ICG, which refinanced £1bn (£900m) of debt when it bought it from a French private equity firm in 2017. Of course, EU negotiators are interested in how Britain treats private equity and its debts: it is a pan-European business - and can be a matter of life and death. For the care home sector is beloved across Europe by private equity magnates. It has two attributes that attract them. First, it is a business with lots of mortgageable property, so the private equity firms can borrow billions to buy the underlying companies, securing the loans on the companies' own assets. Second, care homes have regular, predictable cash revenues that allow them to service the resulting debt offsetting it against tax. So the investors in the private equity company can put up just tens of millionsof their own money at risk (equity) and then borrow hundreds of millions, even billions, to buy companies that will service their debt. Strip out all extraneous costs (and often more), sell the care home company on and, hey presto, you're a multimillionaire. Private Equity News has reported that in Britain private equity companies have pumped £1.8bn into the care home sector over the past 10 years and operate 13% of residential and nursing homes, with 56,700 beds. All around Europe the care home sector has suffered disproportionate Covid-19 deaths. Private equity's interest does not stop at care homes, though. Retailing is asset and revenue rich, so it's not surprising that two private equity companies are vying to buy the supermarket chain Asda from Walmart. Southern Water is part owned by private equity. The Blackstone Group is the largest private equity property manager in the world, savaged by the UN for its rapacious attitude to rents, fees and repairs; it owns the UK's Sage Housing. And how about fostering? The National Fostering Agency and Compass Fostering are both private equity owned. These sectors have another quality. Retailing, catering, hospitality, care homes, utilities and fostering also tend to employ more people for any given pound of turnover than other sectors. Indeed, private equity employs up to 840,000 people, on the industry's own estimates. Its threats are not empty. It needs the government to underwrite its vast debts or it will be ruthless in cutting jobs. The government has to be no less ruthless in response. It cannot be seen to be nationalising losses and privatising gains. If private equity companies want government guarantees then there should be tough quid pro quos - one leading CEO of a FTSE company confided in me that they were amazed the government was so feeble. The accountability it has resisted must be put in place. Balance sheets should be restructured so that banks and directors of private equity companies share the pain. The state should get shares in return for its guarantees. There should be reciprocal commitments on executive pay, working practices, sustaining employment, union recognition and delivering a social purpose beyond short-term profit. If private equity wants public largesse, then it is time to recognise that there are citizenship obligations in return. In the long run, the tax breaks that fuel the entire industry - offsetting interest payments against tax - need to be phased out. It is a sector that has done more to degrade contemporary capitalism than any other. We need more public companies publicly accountable to shareholders and the public, and less indulgence of the indefensible. Britain should not be putting a Brexit deal at risk to save them. '¢ Will Hutton is an Observer columnist '¢ This article was amended on 28 August 2020 to remove an incorrect reference to Care UK. An earlier version said that while the number of care home beds provided by the company had more than doubled in the past 10 years, its staff numbers had fallen by a third; Care UK has informed us that while the group's headcount has reduced through the sale of other parts of the business, its employee-to-bed ratio has actually slightly increased.

More and more people say so: not just Keir Starmer but Tory backbenchers, not just Piers Morgan but the Financial Times, not just leftists on Twitter but the Daily Mail. The list of Boris Johnson's failures - over coronavirus and in just about every other policy area - gets longer every week. Ministers are objects of mockery and contempt. Government incompetence matters, especially during a pandemic. But it's also an easy charge to make - almost too easy. It comes naturally to disillusioned voters, who don't trust politicians anyway; to civil servants, with scores to settle after government cuts; and to journalists, who enjoy judging the powerful and describing Whitehall meltdowns. Accusing Boris Johnson's government of ineptness suits a broad range of political interests, too. All those inside and outside his party who warned for years that he would make a disastrous premier can now say, I told you so. Anyone who voted for a Jeremy Corbyn government last year - supposedly such a terrifying threat - can plausibly argue that it wouldn't have been as chaotic as this. Meanwhile, supporters of the ambitious chancellor, Rishi Sunak, seemingly one of the government's few capable figures, can suggest that he should replace Johnson sooner rather than later. And centrists of all parties can feel vindicated in one of their core beliefs: that managing the existing state machinery well is better than trying to radically change the system. You could even argue that the current clamour for competent government has some things in common with its supposed opposite - the populism that helped put Johnson in power. Like populism, the call for competence appears to be above party politics. It feeds off widely held feelings of loss and outrage. And it often avoids saying how the country ought to be ruled, except in the vaguest terms - 'competently'is not a programme for government. Yet in spite of these limitations, you'd expect a demand for competence to be a powerful weapon against Johnson. The charge of ineptness has brought down many British premiers less calamitous than this one, from Edward Heath and Jim Callaghan in the 70s to John Major in the 90s to Theresa May last year. For decades, academics and political pundits have agreed that a degree of rigour in office is required for any British government to be re-elected. As the political scientists Jane Green and Will Jennings put it in their 2017 book The Politics of Competence: 'Competence is a necessary condition of electability.'But that was before Johnson took office. Last December, after a brief first premiership dominated by parliamentary defeats and undignified concessions to the EU over Brexit, he won the biggest Tory majority for 32 years. This year, despite all their further blunders, the Conservatives have held on to almost all of their large 2019 vote share, according to the polls. Most startling of all, the proportion of people still planning to vote Tory is significantly higher than the proportion who think the government is competent. This seemingly impregnable Tory base helps explain why ministers as hopeless as the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, haven't resigned or been sacked - and also why their expressions of contrition are so cursory when they are confronted about their mistakes by the press. Appearing competent - at least in the way that term is conventionally understood - is no longer a priority for Conservative voters or politicians. Instead, the government has other projects: centralising power, limiting parliamentary democracy, rewarding party donors such as property developers, and awarding public sector contracts to companies with Conservative connections. In these tasks it has so far been pretty effective - you could even say competent. The cleverness of all this shouldn't be overstated. The quite widespread belief among non-Tories that every episode of government chaos is part of a Dominic Cummings masterplan - a diversionary tactic or a deliberate disruption - credits him and the Conservatives with more cunning and calmness than they have, when a lot of what's happening is political opportunism. Even much more able and strategically minded Tory governments, such as Margaret Thatcher's, struggled to manipulate the frequently random flow of political events. Often, a Whitehall meltdown is just a Whitehall meltdown; and Johnson's discomfort when called to account for them by Starmer in the Commons feels too strong to be faked. Yet it's undeniable that the Conservatives have gradually managed to detach their political fortunes from their failures in government. The last time a Tory administration was terminally damaged by an episode of incompetence was more than a quarter of a century ago, in 1992, when Major's sterling policy collapsed on Black Wednesday. Many observers, and especially Labour ones, concluded that competence in office was politically essential. 'What counts is what works,'declared Labour's successful 1997 election manifesto, and the party governed Britain accordingly, producing modest, workable solutions to the country's large problems, such as tax credits and the minimum wage. But many Britons barely noticed these policies: the Labour vote fell sharply at the 2001 and 2005 elections, and the party lost power in 2010. In office since, the Tories have produced a succession of policies that are more ambitious but less practical - austerity, reorganising the NHS, universal credit, Brexit - and their vote share has risen at each election. For a large minority of Britons, it seems, exactly what the Conservatives do, or fail to do, in government doesn't matter, as long as there's a sense of underlying momentum towards a loosely defined rightwing goal, such as a smaller state or a 'global Britain'that can dump the EU and keep out migrants. In a sense, Tory voters have become more like the caricatured leftists they often like to deride: prepared to support a messy government as long as it seems radical. Despite all the disruption their decade in power has brought, the Tories have continued to claim during elections that only they can bring order. 'Britain faces a simple and inescapable choice,'tweeted David Cameron in 2015, 'stability and strong Government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband.'The same line was trotted out against Corbyn last year. In both elections, it was effective. Shamelessness remains a Tory trump card. There are a few signs that their contempt for competence may finally be catching up with them. A YouGov poll this week, one of the first since the exam-grading fiasco, shows a significant shrinking of the Tory lead over Labour. But it's still a lead. It's hard to imagine a Labour government holding on to one in the same circumstances. When parliament returns next month, rather than just telling the government to 'get a grip'- what would Starmer say if it did? - the Labour leader needs to start showing that the Tories' incompetence has deep political roots: in the complacency that comes with being in power too long; and in the unsuitability of many Tory ideas, barely changed since the Thatcher era, to today's world. He will also need to persuade a lot more voters than Labour did at the last election that contempt for the government is not enough. Sometimes, it's a displacement activity: a substitute for the harder job of working out - whether you're the Labour leader or a potential Labour supporter - what sort of government we should have instead. Laughing at 'bumbling Boris'and 'failing Grayling'is easy. But in the end, the joke's on us. '¢ Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist ",0,Neutral
"Lies, suspicion and silence in the Tory party",0,Neutral,"In your admirably concise analysis of the government's failings over the past week, there are two flaws: one of them delusional, the other an omission (The Guardian view on Boris Johnson's government: an omnishambles week, 20 August). First the delusion: 'Much depends on Conservatives with consciences'may have made sense until 12 months ago. Then MPs who dared to challenge the leadership on a range of topics, not just Brexit, but crucially the unlawful prorogation of parliament, were thrown out of their party. Others who shared those opinions decided not to seek re-election, and as a consequence the Conservative parliamentary party can now easily be passed off as a slightly more media-friendly version of Farage's Brexit party. If any are left who have the conscience necessary to challenge 'the New Tory party'ù, they will be fearful of showing themselves until such time as things are much worse and they have no alternative. The omission: aside from citing one opinion poll that suggests Labour is beginning to eat into the Tory lead, the opposition does not feature. I hope that MPs from all other parties are hatching plans to harry ministers at every turn, challenge every decision and use the full force of parliamentary procedure to expose the lies and to investigate the growing suspicion that public money is being misused to feather friends' nests.Les BrightExeter, Devon '¢ Martin Kettle quite rightly sees Boris Johnson as a threat to parliamentary democracy (Johnson vowed to strengthen parliament.

Liz Truss meetings with hard-Brexit group deleted from public register,0,Neutral,"Recent meetings between Liz Truss, the UK trade secretary, and a pro-hard Brexit thinktank have been reclassified as personal discussions, removing them from the public record and sparking Labour allegations that she wants to conceal the group's influence on public policy. Two meetings with Truss and the Institute of Economic Affairs had originally been included in quarterly transparency data published on the government's website and described as discussing trade. They were removed on Wednesday with a note explaining they were personal meetings - the first such revision since the department was created in 2016. The IEA is an influential right-leaning thinktank that promotes free markets and has argued strongly for a hard break from the European Union since the 2016 Brexit referendum. Labour said Truss appeared to be evading rules designed to ensure integrity, transparency and honesty in public office. Government rules require meetings with external organisations that discuss official business to be declared. 'It makes no sense for Liz Truss now to claim that meetings on those issues had nothing to do with her ministerial role, and suggests instead that she has something to hide, whether in terms of who attended the meetings or what specifically was discussed,'said a spokesman for Emily Thornberry, Labour's shadow trade secretary. The Department for International Trade said the meetings were initially included due to an administrative error and they held no information about them. It declined to comment when asked how a meeting on trade and investment could be considered a personal meeting. The IEA said it regularly hosted events and meetings with ministers and others but did not provide any further details of the meetings with Truss.

The Guardian view on parliament's role: bring MPs back now,0,Neutral,"He enjoys an effective Commons majority of 87, but Boris Johnson has always preferred an absent parliament to one that is sitting. When he ousted Theresa May 13 months ago, parliament went straight into a recess which Mr Johnson then tried to extend by prorogation. When the coronavirus pandemic struck in March, parliament went into recess again, and remained absent for almost a month. While thousands of Britons died, and the economy ground almost to a halt, MPs were told to stay at home, while ministers governed by press conference. Parliament last sat on Wednesday 22 July, more than three weeks ago. It is not scheduled to sit again until Tuesday 1 September, which is more than two weeks away. Yet there are exceptionally urgent issues now facing the country. These include the continuing public health emergency itself, the deepening economic recession, the rising tide of unemployment, the Brexit negotiations and, of course, the effects of Covid on the UK nations' school and exam systems. A properly functioning parliamentary democracy should be addressing all of them. The UK's is not. It is therefore not functioning properly. Mr Johnson has no intention of lifting a finger to change this, not least because he cannot cope with Keir Starmer's questioning. Instead, he prefers inane photo opportunities. Absence of scrutiny is this government's modus operandi. Mr Johnson is honing one of the most centralising governments in memory. Ministers, and thus the cabinet, are regarded as marginal. Parliament is seen as actively unwelcome. Dominic Cummings, the prime minister's chief adviser, is busy handing out government contracts to Brexit-backing cronies and waging a war against the civil service. Downing Street is preparing to start a presidential-style briefing system, which Sir Bernard Ingham, Margaret Thatcher's splenetic press secretary, has called a constitutional outrage. In a functioning parliamentary democracy, parliament would now be sitting. The problem is that it can only be recalled by the Speaker on the say-so of ministers, which will not happen. The Speaker is therefore powerless. Over the last two decades, there have been moves to enable other ways of recalling parliament. These have got nowhere, but a mechanism of some sort is urgently needed. Governments must not be allowed to hide from parliament, as the present one is now doing. Where is the indignation and pressure from MPs of all parties, not least Conservatives? Scotland may offer a way forward. The Scottish parliament held its own long recess this summer, from 27 June to 9 August. Yet Scotland's legal obligation to review and renew its Covid regulations meant that, on many Thursdays throughout the recess period, the parliament sat anyway. Something like that should have happened in Westminster too. It would have meant that Mr Johnson's approach to lifting lockdown was scrutinised. It would have ensured Gavin Williamson would have had to answer for the English exam shambles in the way that John Swinney had to for the Scottish one. Westminster recesses are needlessly long anyway. They are set to suit the government not parliament. Almost as soon as MPs return, they are likely to leave again for the autumn conference recess - even though the conferences themselves will be virtual. This is ludicrous. If there was a will, there would be a way to ensure some Commons sittings through this period. The point of a parliament is to hold government to account. Too often, that is not happening. Much of the blame lies with Mr Johnson. But MPs need more fire in their bellies about the way they are being brushed aside too. If they do not stand up for parliament, who will? ",0.125,Positive
"Britain doesn't have a government, it has a permanent campaigning machine",0,Neutral,"The government's frenetic campaign to 'save our summer'has suspended the normal rules of the silly season. Amid the many confusing and shifting statements about the lockdown, No 10 has announced: a 'strategy'to reduce obesity; 'plans'for a 'cycling and walking revolution'ù; a 'bonfire'of planning laws; and, more ominously, the establishment of a panel to reassess judicial limits to state power. You might have even missed the start of an online consultation on flood risk management in Carlisle, the £450,000 spent repairing a flood wall in Hereford, or chancellor Rishi Sunak's visit to Stokesley, North Yorkshire, to learn about flood alleviation. Meanwhile, 127 employers were given awards for supporting the armed forces, transport secretary Grant Shapps announced £589m to 'kickstart rail upgrades across the north'ù, plans for 'congestion-busting'near Swindon were 'unveiled'and a monument to the battle at Gallipoli restored. Twenty years ago, Conservatives accused New Labour of 'initiative-itis'and 'legislative incontinence'ù, endlessly moving from one gimmicky announcement to the next. The current government appears to suffer from a similar affliction. Young governments, like young people, are eager to prove themselves and be approved, but short on patience - and ambitious personnel in government departments are keen to demonstrate their 'on-message'competence. This government's initiative-itis is, of course, also about politicking. (No 10 - not for the first time in its history - is staffed by campaigners in place of policy specialists.) The pandemic and Brexit are both complex policy challenges that our government has proved uniquely ill-equipped to address. Governing by announcement is a way to distract the press and the public from the truth of this incompetence. Bashing judges, praising veterans and publicising investment in 'The North'is red meat to throw at one part of the electorate. Appearing serious about diet, exercise and green transport is the vegan meat substitute for another. This permanent campaigning mindset is how we do government now. The phenomenon of the 'permanent campaign'was named in a 1980 book by the American journalist and political adviser Sidney Blumenthal. His argument was that government decision-making was increasingly based on assessments not of what might be good policy, but of what would look good, keep sponsors on board and appeal to key voters. Government was reduced to 'an instrument designed to sustain an elected official's popularity'ù. The tail was wagging the dog. Boris Johnson's permanent campaign is symptomatic of a deeper change in our politics. Even before the Tories won the 2019 election, Britain was becoming a 'post-democracy'ù. One of the founding propositions of 20th-century mass democracy has been that government should act not for the few, but for everyone. Inherent within this idea is a concept of 'the public interest'ù, or 'the common good'ù. We might not be sure what that is - and we certainly won't be able to agree on it. But in a democracy, so the argument goes, we can come together politically and our representatives will broker a settlement between the competing interests of various social, economic and political groups. Such groups are now more complex and less stable. People's occupational, economic and even geographic locations are more likely to vary over a lifetime. Connections between distinct social interests and their political representatives have been attenuated. In our post-democracy, aggregations of individual tastes and preferences, expressed through opinion polls and surveys, have displaced parties and other civic forums as the means by which government comes to understand 'the people'ù. Instead of public interest, we now find public opinion. Indeed, this government spent more on polling between January and May this year than in the whole of 2019. In place of elections or collective deliberation, opinion polls serve as an ongoing referendum on the government, providing constantly updated information about people's attitudes and reactions, vital for the formation of campaign strategies. There is an argument that this has been a good thing. It means that government is continually apprised of and attentive to public opinion, able to incorporate public concerns within policy-making. If people want a war memorial repaired, and if, in search of their support, politicians repair it, then perhaps democracy is working well. A counter-argument is that governments are no longer experts in governing. Instead, they can think only according to short-term campaign strategies, choosing to do what is most popular rather than what is best for people. As the academic and former government adviser Patrick Diamond puts it, this damaging short-termism becomes endemic. A government focused on 'eye-catching'initiatives, as we have seen, is not preparing for or equipped to deal with a pandemic. In our post-democracy, 'public opinion'is not only a source of policy. It's also an object of policy. Public attitudes, outlooks and behaviour are now a central focus of government policy - the goal of which is not to change the situations people find themselves in, but to change people's feelings about their situations. Post-democratic government is not unconcerned with what you think or want or need. But it doesn't require your participation. It just needs to know how you might respond to the various things it might do to you. What the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, understands that most politicians do not is that polling, surveys and focus groups don't tell you what people think or what public opinion definitively 'is'ù. They provide a rough map of possibilities and probabilities of what people might come to think, depending on various potential scenarios and actions. In the leave campaign, different versions of adverts were tested, refined and retested in what Cummings has called a 'constant iterative process'and combined with feedback from polls and focus groups. In government, this approach has turned the Tories' permanent campaign into a permanent experiment, the endless measuring and testing of means for managing and shaping political attitudes. We are the subjects of this ongoing experiment, the single data points in a larger firmament. That, in post-democracy, is what constitutes citizenship. And while it won't save summer, it might - as you enjoy your half-price Sunak-branded meal next Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday - change how you feel about its loss.

Brexit fuels brain drain as skilled Britons head to the EU,0,Neutral,"Brexit has sparked an exodus of economically productive people from the UK to European Union nations on a scale that would normally be expected only as a result of a major economic or political crisis, according to a detailed new study. Using a combination of official statistics across the EU and in-depth interviews with people living in Germany, the study found huge changes in migration patterns of UK citizens since the 2016 referendum, which contrast with largely stable ones among nationals from the 27 EU states remaining in the bloc. The report, a collaboration between the Oxford in BerlinResearch Partnership - a project made up of Oxford university and four Berlin institutions - and the WZB Berlin Social Science Center, also found a 'seismic shift'in the number of UK citizens already living abroad who had decided to go a step further by obtaining EU member state passports since 2016, showing how Britain's vote to leave the EU pushed many individuals into long-term decisions. The study says that migration from the UK to EU countries has increased by about 30% compared to pre-Brexit numbers. Britons living in other EU countries who decided to obtain EU member state passports as well as their UK ones had increased by more than 500% overall, and by 2,000% in Germany. Dr Daniel Auer, a co-author of the report, said: 'These increases in numbers are of a magnitude that you would expect when a country is hit by a major economic or political crisis.'Moreover, the study found that UK migrants are among the most educated and skilled of those from any nation, with one of the highest net average income rates, suggesting that Brexit has begun a steady drain of the most talented and productive people to the continent. In Germany, UK migrants were among the highest earners, bringing in on average £2,812 a month in 2019, just behind those from Austria and the US. There are now about 1.2 million British citizens living in the EU, between 120,000 and 150,000 of which are in Germany. In the four years since the Brexit referendum, 31,600 Brits have been granted dual British/German citizenship: 2019 saw 14,600 naturalisations compared to 622 in 2015. About half of all British citizens living in Germany will have dual UK/German nationality by the end of 2020, the report says. Interviews with UK citizens living and working in Germany showed Brexit had made people prepared to take on levels of risk that they previously would not have considered.  A British academic in his 40s, who is married with a young family - and who migrated in July 2016 - told researchers: 'The referendum happened and we immediately changed our minds about buying a house in Bristol. Our whole emigration decision hung on the referendum result.'The majority of interviewees who left agreed to either a pay cut or a pay freeze as part of their decision. Some struggled to find a job. 'I have still not found work, which is not what I expected ['¶] The cost of the move in personal and financial terms is always difficult to foresee, and I'm starting to wonder if I underestimated the risk involved,'said a British IT worker who migrated in October 2019 with his wife and three children. Co-author Daniel Tetlow added: 'We're observing a new social migration phenomenon and a redefining of what it means to be British-European. In 2019, Brits came in just behind Turks in numbers receiving German citizenship - way ahead of Poles, Romanians, Iraqis or Syrians, whom you might otherwise expect to be more eagerly applying for German/EU citizenship.'",1.875,Positive
This isn't a tough new food policy for post-Brexit UK. It's thin gruel and easy to set to one side,-0.375,Negative,"The headlines were compelling. The Covid-19 crisis would lead to a dramatic increase in poverty and hunger; free school meals should be extended to a further 1.6 million children; another 1.1 million children in England should become eligible for holiday food programmes. The National Food Strategy document released last Wednesday was, on the face of it, an impressive opening shot from the team led by businessman Henry Dimbleby. But for all the laudable anger over hunger contained in this first report from the National Food Strategy, it was received across the world of food production and policy with at best eye-rolling and at worst exasperation. It is the product of grubby politics, includes worrying proposals on post-Brexit trade policy, muddled thinking on the causes of poverty and risks wasting a golden opportunity to answer one of the most important challenges of the 21st century: how we feed ourselves. The notion of a national food strategy was first put to Michael Gove, the then secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, in 2016 by, among others, Minette Batters, now president of the National Farmers' Union. Gove had only to find someone to lead it. During the referendum campaign, he had famously announced that we'd 'had enough of experts'ù. It wasn't just a novel slogan by which to secure Brexit. It is an item of faith in Whitehall. If you're appointing someone to lead a government review, God forbid they should have serious credentials. That makes it harder to ignore their findings. But the appointee still had to be convincing. Gove had just the person: his close friend Henry Dimbleby. He started out as a journalist, then moved into management consultancy, before founding the healthier fast food chain Leon. In 2013, when Gove was education secretary, Dimbleby had published a review into school food provision. But, for all his diligent work in the sector, he has no qualifications in food policy. That would make him eminently ignorable if his recommendations turned out to be tricky. He is also cut from the right political cloth. As he later boasted to friends, Dimbleby spent the night of the 2016 Brexit referendum at Gove's house and had voted Leave. Dimbleby cannot be faulted for his thoroughness. He worked with an illustrious team of advisers and conducted endless consultations with food producers, policy specialists and consumers. But he then made the bizarre decision to write his paper in the first person, complete with colourful personal anecdotes. It's not the National Food Strategy - it's the Dimbleby report. And that makes it very easy to bat away. He told me he did this because it was 'impossible to get a consensus of informed experts'ù. It isn't impossible. It's merely hard. Just last week, for example, the environment, food and rural affairs select committee released its own damning report on government failures on food supply during the Covid-19 crisis. That represented consensus. Still, if that's Dimbleby's position, we should let him own his words. While he acknowledges the impact of poverty and proposes short-term fixes such as extending free school meals, he fails to recognise that systematic inequality is caused by a failure of long-term government economic policy. But then that would be to criticise Downing Street. Likewise, he regularly refers to the 'freedoms'offered by leaving the EU, without considering whether the Brexit he voted for will blight the lives of the impoverished children he clearly cares about so deeply. But it is the section on post-Brexit trade policy that is most troubling. It reads as if he has taken dictation direct from government. He robustly defends the government's recent vote against the amendment to the agriculture bill, introduced by MP Neil Parish, which would have prevented the ratification of any trade agreements allowing the importation of food not produced to standards of production and welfare equivalent to those in the UK. Without getting into nerdy detail, Dimbleby's defence misunderstands the Parish amendment. Interestingly, the argument he deploys is identical to that in a recent post by Liam Fox MP on the Conservative Home website. Dimbleby also argues that, as products that don't meet our standards already make it into the UK, for example, pork from Denmark, campaigners are being too precious. As Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, London, put it to me: 'We all know about such products. That doesn't mean you make allowing them in policy.'Dimbleby claims he supports maintaining high food standards and that this can be assured through, among other things, the government's recently announced Trade and Agriculture Commission. The commission has already been roundly dismissed as unfit for purpose by leading figures in the food industry. It is farmer-heavy, has no experts on animal welfare or public health and a lifespan measured in months. 'It's an arm's-length government PR exercise stuffed with industry interests and can't resolve all the issues involved in the time given,'Lang says. 'Dimbleby says his is an independent report. But at critical moments it just becomes a government report. Many people think it will be sidelined, though his knighthood is safe.'This first paper is due to be followed next year by another, looking at sustainable supply chains and agriculture. Those reports should then feed into a government white paper. Last week, Defra officials were quietly telling interested parties not to waste too much energy on Dimbleby's findings and to focus instead on lobbying over the contents of the white paper. Already, the current Defra secretary, George Eustice, has issued a weak statement thanking Dimbleby for his work but merely committing to 'carefully consider'his recommendations on poverty. It is the sound of a ball being kicked firmly into the long grass. Tragically, a serious opportunity to challenge the shape of our food system has been missed.

"Evgeny Lebedev, Jo Johnson and Ian Botham among 36 peerage nominations",0,Neutral,"Russian-born billionaire newspaper proprietor Evgeny Lebedev and the prime minister's brother, Jo Johnson, are among dozens of new nominations for peerages announced by Downing Street, while Theresa May's husband is set for a knighthood. Evening Standard and Independent owner Lebedev, who held a party in Italy attended by Boris Johnson when he was foreign secretary, is a surprise name among the 36 life peerage nominations which have led to accusations of 'cronyism'against the prime minister. Johnson's chief strategic adviser, Sir Edward Lister, as well as a host of Tory grandees and well-known Brexiters, including former England cricketer Sir Ian Botham, are also heading for seats in the Lords. In a sign the prime minister is trying to soothe Tory party divisions, ex-chancellors Philip Hammond and Ken Clarke - brutally stripped of the whip last year after rebelling over Brexit - are also nominated for peerages. They will be joined by the former Scottish Conservatives leader, Ruth Davidson, who is also on the nominations list. The list of nominations published on Friday also include ex-prime minister May's husband, Philip - once described by her as a 'rock'throughout their marriage - who is being knighted for political service. The newly announced peerages caused immediate controversy. The Lord Speaker warned that numbers in the House of Lords will now swell beyond 800 despite a previous pledge of restraint over new appointments. Ex-Labour MPs who backed Brexit - Kate Hoey, Ian Austin, and Gisela Stuart - are also on the list. But noticeably absent are former Commons speaker John Bercow and former Labour deputy leader Tom Watson. Tory donor and City grandee Michael Spencer is also among those nominated for a peerage. Charles Moore, who as a former Daily Telegraph editor was the prime minister's boss, and Claire Fox, the ex-Brexit party MEP and former member of the Revolutionary Communist party, are both nominated for non-affiliated peerages. Neil Mendoza, the provost of Oriel College Oxford who found himself at the centre of the recent Rhodes Must Fall controversy, was also nominated by Johnson for a peerage. He was heavily involved in securing the £1.5bn arts bailout and is expected to play a role in distributing it. In addition to May's knighthood, there is the same honour for Ray Puddifoot, the Tory leader of Hillingdon council, which comes within Johnson's constituency. The prime minister's brother, Jo, stood down as a Tory MP at the general election. Months earlier, he had quit his ministerial role serving in his brother's government, citing an 'unresolvable tension'between his family loyalty and the national interest. Lebedev, who is nominated as a crossbench peer, hosted Johnson at his Italian party in 2018. The prime minister also headed to Lebedev's London family home in the aftermath of his 2019 election victory to celebrate the 60th birthday of his father, Alexander, a former KGB spy. There is also a peerage for former Evening Standard editor Veronica Wadley, whose support for Boris Johnson during the 2008 London mayoral election played a key role in his victory over Ken Livingstone. Reacting to the unveiling of the nominations, the Lord Speaker of the House of Lords, Lord Fowler, said: 'This list of new peers marks a lost opportunity to reduce numbers in the House of Lords. The result will be that the house will soon be nearly 830 strong - almost 200 greater than the House of Commons. That is a massive policy U-turn. It was only two years ago that the then prime minister, Mrs May, pledged herself to a policy of restraint in the number of new appointments. It was the first time that any prime minister had made such a pledge. 'This followed a report by a special Lord Speaker's committee chaired by Lord (Terry) Burns proposing that numbers should be reduced to 600. This was debated by the Lords itself with over 90 speakers, commanding overwhelming support. The big opportunity was for the present government to take forward this movement for reform. I emphasise that this is not a matter of personalities. It is a question of numbers and the abandonment of an established policy to reduce the size of the house. 'It is also a vast pity that the list has been announced within the first few days of the summer recess when neither house is sitting, and the government cannot be challenged in Parliament.'The Liberal Democrats' leader in the Lords, Lord Newby, added: 'By giving a large number of his cronies peerages, he has shown that the Tories have abandoned any pretence of reducing the size of the bloated House of Lords.'SNP MP Pete Wishart called the move 'the worst kind of cronyism'ù, accusing the prime minister of giving jobs for life to 'friends and those who have done him favours'ù. Darren Hughes, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said: 'Based on the average claim of a peer, the 36 new peers are likely to cost £1.1m a year in expenses from the taxpayer. 'By appointing a host of ex-MPs, party loyalists and his own brother, the PM is inviting total derision. That he can get away with it shows what a private member's club this house is. 'The Lords was already the largest second chamber in the world. There are now over 800 unelected peers, voting on our laws for life. Is packing the Lords with party loyalists really a priority, as a pandemic rages across the world? This move is an absolute insult to voters. This is making a mockery of democracy.'",0.375,Positive
National food strategy set out: banishing pollution and poverty for sustainability,-0.25,Negative,"Henry Dimbleby's national food strategy argues that the Covid-19 crisis has brought into painful focus the flaws in the UK's food system, especially its effect on the nation's physical and mental health. As the UK regenerates its economy it also has an opportunity to rebuild its food system. The strategy review has two main focus points: addressing the 'worst cracks'in the British food system that have appeared because of the pandemic; and finding ways of maintaining what it calls the UK's high food standards after the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December and the country seeks new trade deals around the world. The report is, in effect, an interim strategy. A second report is due next year, to which the government will formally respond and which will address in more depth issues ranging from climate change and agriculture to public health. That the UK went into the pandemic with such high rates of obesity and diet-related disease undoubtedly contributed to the country's high death rate, the report says, highlighting how damaging the 'slow-motion disaster of the British diet'is to the human body. The poorest people suffer most from this diet, the report says. It notes that 36% of the most deprived people are obese. But the rich also have a weight problem: obesity rates stand at over 20% in all sections of society. 'How did we get to the point where food - our source of life giving sustenance is making us sick - and why has it proved to do anything about it?'the review asks. Dimbleby points to Britain's food culture. Before lockdown Britons spent a smaller proportion of income on meals at home than any other Europeans. He finds that many rush meals, eat less together as families, and rely more on takeaways. The UK does not place as high a value on cooking as our continental neighbours. Dimbleby defends the food industry and free market, but says it has to share some of the blame. Too many of the manufactured food products sold in the UK are highly processed, and energy dense; we are tempted by heavily discounted promotions of fat and sugary food aimed to satisfy our 'evolutionary craving'ù. 'Serving sugary, fatty, high-calorie foods guarantees a market,'he notes. 'There is more money to be made from selling processed snacks than from fresh vegetables.'Food manufacturers have to be more ethical, says Dimbleby. He rails at faux-health foods, 'clothed in a veneer of goodness but no better for you than a Mars bar'ù. Tackling poor diet is all not about individual choice. Government has a role to play, and he endorses its obesity strategy, published this week, which restricts junk-food advertising. But more is needed. Should nanny tell us what to eat? 'It seems clear that the state has the moral authority to intervene in people's lives to help them eat better.'One of the 'miserable legacies'of Covid-19 will be a dramatic increase in unemployment and poverty, says the report. There will be a surge in 'people who find themselves suddenly struggling to put food on the table'ù. That means more food insecurity and less healthy eating. Dimbleby praises the government's efforts at trying to protect jobs and incomes via a range of schemes. 'But however Herculean the efforts of the state many people will find themselves out of work,'he concludes. 'Poverty will almost certainly increase and with it the number of people going hungry.'The report focuses on the physical and psychological effects of hunger on young people whose bodies are developing. Lack of nutrition stores up health problems for later life. Poor diet also affects concentration in school. 'Food insecurity undermines any serious prospect of improving social inequality.'The interventions proposed by the review - an expansion of free school meals and holiday hunger schemes for youngsters from all households on universal credit, as well a boost for fresh food vouchers for pregnant mothers - reflects the focus on the importance of tackling child poverty. The report steps back from making recommendations about the benefit system, though it notes that universal credit was not designed to deal with a massive surge in jobless people, including middle-income households with fixed rent and bills. 'Clearly the best way to tackle food poverty is to tackle poverty.'It adds: 'There is no dignity in people having to rely on food banks, food stamps or emergency grants from councils.'Leaving the EU gives the UK a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape its food system, potentially putting into place a system of importing food that protects the environment and animal welfare and mitigates climate change. The government should have the confidence to subject any prospective trade deals to a 'gold standard'of independent scrutiny not least by parliament, the review says. All proposed trade agreements should be assessed for their impact on food safety, the environment, human rights and animal welfare. The government should only cut tariffs on imported food products which meet the UK's 'core standards'ù, using a series of verification programmes, to, for example, allow US farmers to sell to the UK beef that has not been treated with hormones Any food producer wishing to sell to the UK must prove they meet these minimum standards. The review advises that certification schemes should used to deliver environmental and climate protection - such as maintaining tariffs on beef reared on land recently cleared of rainforest. The food system is a massive polluter and producer of CO2, it points out, but this is rarely understood as a part of the true cost of food production. Dimbleby calls for a sustainable food system based upon diversity. His vision includes organic farms, solar-powered high-rise greenhouses, fruit and vegetable cultivation in cities, and robots that pick weeds. His next report will tackle the impact of meat consumption on the environment, and will lay out a blueprint for a greener food system - 'one that no longer makes us or our planet sick'ù. ",0,Neutral
Post-Brexit checks for Northern Ireland 'may deter large GB firms',0,Neutral,"Concerns that big British businesses, such as Tesco, will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords. Lord Kerr, the architect of article 50 which enabled the UK to leave the EU, has said the special arrangements put in place to avoid a border on the island of Ireland may be a fatal trade barrier for some companies. Under the Northern Ireland protocol, all businesses sending goods to the region from Great Britain will have to make formal declarations for the first time, with food sellers, such as supermarkets, subject to separate checks on chilled and fresh food from January. 'How confident are you that GB businesses are just not going to write off the Northern Ireland market?'he asked the Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker, who was appearing before the Lords EU committee. 'I am very concerned,'he continued. 'Are you talking to the big stores? Are you talking to the Tescos, who have an operation in Northern Ireland but all the extra costs of this, and all the [extra] bureaucracy, may make it to them seem just not worthwhile?'ù. Just three weeks ago the first details of the new trading conditions across the Irish Sea emerged, with businesses obliged to complete customs, security and transit forms on all goods being transported to Northern Ireland. Walker said the government intended the new system to be 'light touch'and streamlined. However, he faced further questions about the government's preparedness, with Lord Teverson asking whether the new IT system, the Goods Vehicle Movement System, would be tested in time. And the former Conservative chancellor Lord Lamont challenged Boris Johnson's repeated assertion that Northern Irish businesses would continue to enjoy 'unfettered access'to Great British markets. Lamont argued there was a clear conflict in the Brexit protocol between article 5, which demands Northern Ireland businesses complete exit summary declarations for all goods being transported to the rest of the UK, and article 6, which promises 'unfettered access'ù. 'That is a rather awkward thing,'he told Walker, saying it was within the UK's gift to ensure unfettered access. Walked conceded that some of the detail of the protocol had yet to be agreed by the joint committee chaired by Michael Gove and the vice-president of the European commission, Maro≈° ≈†efƒçoviƒç. He also said details on the Northern Ireland border operating model, expected on Monday, would be published in the 'coming weeks'ù. ",0.375,Positive
"If you're not terrified about Facebook, you haven't been paying attention",0,Neutral,"In 2016, we didn't know. We were innocent. We still believed social media connected us and that connections were good. That technology equalled progress. And progress equalled better. Four years on, we know too much. And yet, it turns out, we understand nothing. We know social media is a bin fire and that the world is burning. But it's like the pandemic. We understand in outline how bad things could get. But we remain hopelessly human. Relentlessly optimistic. Of course, we believe there'll be a vaccine. Because there has to be, doesn't there? In Facebook's case, the worst has already happened. We've just failed to acknowledge it. Failed to reckon with it. And there's no vaccine coming to the rescue. In 2016 everything changed. As for 2020'¶ well, we will see. We have already been through the equivalent of a social media pandemic - an unstoppable contagion that has sickened our information space, infected our public discourse, silently and invisibly subverted our electoral systems. It's no longer about if this will happen all over again. Of course, it will. It hasn't stopped. The question is whether our political systems, society, democracy, will survive - can survive - the age of Facebook. We are already through the looking glass. In 2016, a hostile foreign government used Facebook to systematically undermine and subvert an American election. With no consequences. Nobody, no company, no individual or nation state has ever been held to account. Zuckerberg says Black Lives Matter and yet we know Donald Trump used Facebook's tools to deliberately suppress and deny black and Latino people the vote. With no consequences. And though we know the name 'Cambridge Analytica'and were momentarily outraged by Facebook's complicity in allowing 87 million people's personal data to be stolen and repurposed including by the Trump campaign. A $5bn fine was paid but no individuals were held to account. And that's just in America. For us here in Britain, there's an even bigger reckoning that has not come. If it wasn't for Facebook, there would be no Brexit. The future of our country - our island nation with its 1,000 years of continuous history of which we're so proud - has been set on its course by a foreign company that has proved itself to be beyond the rule of parliament. Who in Britain understands that? Almost no one. The intelligence and security committee, perhaps, who reported their astonishment this week that no attempt had been made to investigate foreign interference in the EU referendum. And maybe Dominic Cummings, the man who sits in 10 Downing Street by Boris Johnson's side. Dominic Cummings understands the role that Facebook played in Brexit. He wrote about it. In excruciating Cummings detail. He described the deliberate use of misinformation targeted at unknown individuals in an election operation the scale of which had never been seen before. He deployed more than a billion Facebook ads, he says. At a cost of pennies per view. He doesn't talk about this now, of course. And though the intelligence committee noted media companies 'hold the key and yet are failing to play their part'ù, it also says 'DCMS informed us that [REDACTED]'ù. The fact is that we now know how the platform was systematically abused by the Leave campaigns. We know that loopholes in our laws were deliberately exploited. And we know that these actions were proved to be illegal and 'punished'by 'regulators'whose 'regulations'have been exposed to be not worth the paper they are written on. Will Facebook be used to subvert the 2020 US presidential election? Yes. Will Facebook be held to account? No. Are we looking at a system shock that will change America for ever? Yes. Because Trump will either win this election using Facebook or he will lose it using Facebook. Both ways spell disaster. On Sunday, interviewed by a Fox reporter, he refused to say if he would leave the White House if he lost the election. America, the idea of America, is on the brink. And at the cold, dead heart of the suicide mission it has set itself on, is Facebook. Facebook and America are now indivisible. Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, these are now the bloodstream of American life and politics. A bloodstream that is sick. And so the world is sick, because American capitalism has been the vector that has brought this infection across the globe. Algorithmically amplified 'free speech'with no consequences. Lies spread at speed. Hate freely expressed, freely shared. Ethnic hatred, white supremacy, resurgent Nazism all spreading invisibly, by stealth beyond the naked eye. For Trump 2020, the band is back together. The chief data scientist of Cambridge Analytica, Matt Oczkowski has launched a new firm, Data Propria, which is working with the digital director of Trump's 2016 campaign Brad Parscale. And Trump is testing his limits. Can he place ads that feature Nazi symbols? Yes. (Taken down but only after accruing millions of views.) Can he spread lies about mail-in fraud? Yes. Can he threaten Black Lives Matter protesters with violence? Yes. Will be he be able to use Facebook to dispute the election? Watch this space. In a world without consequences, the bad man will be king. And an aggressive multinational company whose business model is threatened by the bad man's opponent is, at best, conflicted; at worst, complicit. This week, Mark Zuckerberg was forced to deny he had a 'secret deal'with Trump. 'A ridiculous idea,'he said. It was an uncanny echo of the 'pretty crazy idea'he cited in November 2016 when it was first suggested fake news on Facebook might have played a role in electing Trump. It wasn't crazy. It was true. We know this because of the painstaking work the FBI and congressional committees did in investigating foreign interference in the US election. Work that hasn't even been begun in the UK. That was not an accident we discovered this week. It was because of another populist who didn't want the truth to come out: Boris Johnson. Facebook is at the centre of this too. It's Facebook that enables hostile nation states like Russia to attack us in our homes. A geopolitical war being fought in front of our noses, in our pockets, on our phones.  This is Facebook's world now. And we live in it. And if you're not terrified about what this means it's because you haven't been paying attention. ",0.125,Positive
Russian intervention didn't sway the Brexit referendum - our rightwing press did,0,Neutral,"Britain is a democracy with heavy caveats. It allows its citizens an equal vote, but not an equal say. Those with wealth gain power and influence - through access to politicians, donations to political parties, lobbying, well-funded thinktanks and ownership of most of the press. 'As inequality grows, so does the political influence of the rich,'is how that well-known bastion of socialism the Economist put it a couple of years ago. Yet we are denied a proper debate on how British democracy is subverted by vested interests because it would mean most newspapers - who play a major part in framing the national conversation - having to scrutinise their own role. This week, the long-delayed intelligence and security committee report into alleged Russian interference in British democracy had troubling findings: not least ministers turning an apparent blind eye. Vladimir Putin's kleptocratic gangster regime should be opposed by anyone with progressive inclinations: for its murderous war in Chechnya, in which tens of thousands perished; its state-sanctioned bigotry against LGBTQ people; and for its ties with the European far right. That the Conservatives financially benefit from donations linked to Russian oligarchs is itself a concern, as is Britain's status as a safe haven for dirty money worth about £100bn a year. But the spectre of Russian interference has become a crutch for many liberal centrists. Easier to claim the nefarious hand of Putin is responsible for political events we do not like - from Brexit to Donald Trump - than to ask searching questions about our own dysfunctional democracies. Calls to clamp down on states intervening in each other's affairs need to be consistent, or risk being hypocritical and self-serving. The United States backed Boris Yeltsin's presidential campaign in 1996: a Time front page in July that year hailed 'The secret story of how American advisers helped Yeltsin win'ù, and the Bill Clinton administration lobbied the International Monetary Fund to provide Yeltsin with a loan to boost his re-election efforts. Richard Dearlove, the former MI6 chief, has publicly regretted that British security services helped Putin win power in 2000. On the eve of that presidential election, Tony Blair praised Putin as a moderniser who was 'highly intelligent and with a focused view of what he wants to achieve in Russia'ù, even as Chechnya was being flattened. Postwar history is littered with examples of western-backed coups and meddling in foreign elections. But when figures such as the Labour peer Andrew Adonis claim Putin 'helped swing the 2016 Brexit referendum'ù, other far more salient factors are obscured. Facebook advertising undoubtedly played a role - the Vote Leave campaign would not have spent more than £2.7m on it otherwise - but in 2016, just 7% of the most pro-leave demographic, the over-65s, used Facebook for news, compared with 49% of the most pro-remain age group, the under-25s, according to Ofcom. Of far more relevance was the role of the two largest newspapers in Britain, the Sun - owned by an Australian-born American mogul, if we're talking of foreign intervention - and the Daily Mail, which forcefully campaigned for Brexit. Not only do they have millions of readers, their front pages play a key role in shaping broadcast news coverage too. And given that immigration played a key role in the referendum, years of inaccurate and inflammatory press reporting on migrants surely had a dramatic impact on the result. As a 2018 academic study found, while the media are not all-powerful, there is 'ample evidence that the media can impact on attitude formation, especially (but not exclusively) where the public are dependent on coverage, have weak partisan predispositions, or where reporting is uniform or near-uniform across a range of sources'ù. Polls routinely find that the public believe benefit fraud and teenage pregnancy is far higher than is the case, and that there are more migrants: undoubtedly this has much to do with exaggerated and misleading reporting. According to Will Straw, formerly of Britain Stronger in Europe, when the official remain campaign conducted a poll in the summer of 2015, it found that 52% supported continued membership of the EU, with 48% for leaving. This was based on two-thirds of Labour supporters and 50% of Tory voters opting for remain. While Labour remain support held up all the way to referendum day, Tory support slumped to 40%, ensuring a Brexit triumph: it would be delusional to ignore the role of rightwing newspapers disproportionately read by Tory voters. The obsessive focus with Putin robs us of the chance to discuss these issues. After the 2016 defeat, the rational approach by the remain movement would have been to focus on winning over leave voters. Instead, social media helped radicalise some remainers into believing the referendum was illegitimate - and hence that it was a legal rather than a political problem. The menace of Russian intervention helped cement this attitude. That doesn't mean ignoring possible foreign meddling in democratic processes, here or abroad, and measures must be taken to safeguard elections. But while much time and energy has been expended on debating the role of Russia, there is all too little scrutiny about the far greater crisis of how the wealthy, and their vested interests, interfere in and distort democracy. Until we challenge that the question marks over our own democracy will remain.

"Brexit negotiations have not broken down, say No 10 sources",0,Neutral,"Downing Street sources have denied Brexit negotiations between the UK and European Union have broken down, but admit they are at an impasse. After two full days of talks in London, No 10 officials described the current state of play as neither a 'breakthrough nor a breakdown'ù. The latest round is expected to end on Thursday without advancing on a deal. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, and his UK counterpart, David Frost, are in the midst of intensified discussions. A fifth round of talks will go ahead as planned next week, with another round scheduled for August unless agreed otherwise. The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain's entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a 'deep-seated hostility'towards the European project. With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home. The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted ""yes"". Margaret Thatcher, later to be leader of the Conservative party, campaigned to remain. Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the ""iron lady"" marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand 'our own money back'claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back'despite being one of the 'three poorer'members of the community. It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.† Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in 'embryo'ù. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU. Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was 'òno, no, no' to what she saw as Delors' continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch's Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered 'Up yours Delors'front page. A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of 'a single market without barriers - visible or invisible - giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world's wealthiest and most prosperous people"".

David Cameron returns from Brussels with an EU reform package - but it isn't enough to appease the Eurosceptic wing of his own party The UK votes to leave the European Union, triggering David Cameron's resignation and paving the way for Theresa May to become prime minister After years of parliamentary impasse during Theresa May's attempt to get a deal agreed, the UK leaves the EU. Differences are said to remain on the issues of a level playing field for businesses, governance, state aid rules and fishing rights. The EU's preference for a role for the European court of justice is also a sticking point. The prime minister's official spokesperson said the UK was continuing to engage with the EU constructively. 'Round five negotiations are ongoing and we remain committed to working hard to find the outlines of a balanced agreement '¶ but significant differences still remain on a number of important issues,'he said. 'Our preference is to leave with an FTA [free trade agreement] as long as it guarantees our political and economic independence. But we will make sure that we're prepared for all possible scenarios.'He added: 'The discussions do continue to be constructive and I think that's been the case throughout this intensified state of the discussions, but equally I think we acknowledge that there are still significant differences on a number of important issues.'Some backbench Conservative MPs are said to be getting nervous that a deal will not be ready in time for the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020. Reports that Frost had said the UK would accept tariffs on certain goods are believed to have added to confusion among the Tory ranks about the government's position. Labour is also said to be looking closely at recent polling that has shown voters in their former 'red wall'strongholds overwhelmingly want Johnson to strike a deal on Brexit rather than walk away from talks. The north and Midlands could bear the brunt of the economic downturn because of the coronavirus pandemic and potential consequences of a no-deal scenario. The UK has piled on pressure to get a quick Brexit deal sealed this month, with Boris Johnson saying in June there was no reason an outline agreement could not be struck in July, urging the EU to put 'the tiger in the tank'ù, a reference to a 1960s Esso slogan. However, his flamboyant approach was immediately punctured by the EU, which said it expected talks to go into September. Charles Michel, the European council president, batted back that the bloc was 'ready to put a tiger in the tank but not to buy a pig in a poke'ù. One senior EU source predicted before the latest round of talks that the UK would try and 'inject some drama and theatre'into the talks, with rows seen as a by-product of the tension to create the space for a deal.

The Guardian view on the Russia report: elections need to be protected,0,Neutral,"Was the Brexit referendum swung by Vladimir Putin's Russia? Under Boris Johnson, we may never know. Unlike the US - where a report into Russian interference in the 2016 election was produced within two months of the vote - Britons have been kept in the dark about Moscow's meddling. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson rejected a call by MPs on the intelligence and security committee (ISC) for an inquiry into 'potential Russian interference in the 2016 vote'ù. The government claims there was no evidence of 'successful interference in the EU referendum'- but how would it know if no one has looked? The lack of curiosity about the protection of the political process from foreign influence is bad news for a liberal democracy built on the idea of safe elections. But it is good news for Mr Putin, who wants western voters to lose trust in their political systems. The ISC report is about a year old. It seems likely that Mr Johnson had blocked its publication for political reasons. If it had emerged that there had been no assessment of the seriousness of the threat that Russia posed to our democracy last year, then without a majority in parliament he might have been forced to concede one. After December he could brush off calls for an inquiry. Given the steady stream of revelations about Mr Putin's well-oiled campaign to interfere in elections across Europe, it ought to be obvious that there should be an appraisal of how many Russian financiers, trolls, hackers and provocateurs were allowed to influence the most important political choice the country has faced in decades. The motivations of the prime minister deserve scrutiny. Russia is not a rival to western democracy, but it is a hostile state that lives off our moral flaws. That is the message lurking in the lucid prose of the ISC report. Mr Johnson shows little enthusiasm for the necessary steps to disrupt the flow of ill-gotten gains into the UK. His line seems to be that conniving with crooks is only wrong when one is caught. Mr Johnson thinks that if oligarchs want to enrol peers in their business interests, then that's up to them. The prime minister appears to view influence peddlers as political entrepreneurs who don't need to be burdened with the red tape of parliamentary reporting requirements. Then there is the burgeoning sector of enablers in the banks, law firms and estate agents who grease the wheels of money laundering. Mr Johnson thinks Britain has got the balance right when it comes to Mr Putin's friends. He could not be more wrong. According to the MPs, Russia is a 'highly capable cyber actor'that 'considers the UK one of its top western intelligence targets'ù. Yet elections are conducted over social media in this country with little regulation. Our politics has become poisoned by figures who have floated upwards on a rising tide of disinformation. When people stop trusting institutions, they can easily accept a conspiratorial vision of the world. The path to Brexit was eased in this way. This week, researchers at Warwick university concluded that areas that voted leave have suffered the greatest economic hit since the Brexit vote. Voters were sold a false prospectus. Mr Johnson has made a career out of shirking responsibility for the economic, political and social damage his ambition has caused. He should not be wearing the smirk of a Russian troll. Instead, the prime minister ought to be deadly serious about showing that Britain's democracy cannot be manipulated, and that not everyone and everything is for sale. ",-0.5,Negative
"Boris Johnson was asleep on the job, and since when was idleness a crime?",0,Neutral,"Somewhere in Epsom, Chris Grayling was sobbing loudly having managed to lock himself in a cupboard.

Meanwhile up in London, Julian Lewis, who had stolen the chair of the ISC from under Failing Grayling's nose simply by promising the four opposition MPs on the committee that he would publish the Russia report as soon as possible, was happily taking centre stage in a book-lined room, having first made sure the curtains were firmly drawn. Satisfied there were no foreign spooks peering in, Lewis began the press conference by insisting he was only the facilitator. The compere, if you like. He hadn't been on the committee when it had written the report, so he wanted to leave the interpretation of its findings to two men who had. Labour's Kevan Jones kicked things off by referring to the nine-month delay in publication. This had been entirely down to the prime minister, whose four different excuses for postponing and discrediting the report had all been outright lies. Jones didn't mince his words. He'd been waiting a long time to let Boris Johnson know what he thought of him and he wasn't going to waste the opportunity now. Thereafter the press conference turned into a double act for Jones and the SNP's Stewart Hosie, with each man taking it in three-minute turns to expose the ease with which the British political process could have been corrupted. Neither MI6 or GCHQ had been tasked with investigating Russian interference and MI5 had never got round to tasking itself with doing the job. After all, it was well known that Russia was actively trying to destabilise the west, having already attempted to influence the Scottish independence referendum and the 2016 US presidential election. What's more, UK politicians had become far too chummy with Russian oligarchs and not too bothered about the source of the money flowing into the 'Londongrad laundromat'ù, just so long as it continued to arrive by the sackful. But the killer line was that it was impossible to say whether the Russians had tried to influence the Brexit referendum because the government had made no attempt to find out one way or another. The result had gone the way that Vote Leave had wanted, so there was no point in rocking the boat. Why take the gloss off a result that had given so many people so much pleasure? Not to mention put Boris into Downing Street three years later. Besides, it was unthinkable that the Russians would bother to interfere in something as inconsequential as the UK's membership of the EU. The government had been given the warnings, been given the chance to investigate, and yet had chosen to do precisely nothing. Such laissez-faire attitudes opened up some fascinating possibilities. At a stroke, the police could get rid of all their unsolved crimes simply by saying those crimes had never been committed. That boy who had been stabbed had merely accidentally tripped on a knife. That car hadn't been stolen, someone had merely driven it by mistake. But why stop here? Why not see just where a total lack of curiosity might get you? If no one had gone to the trouble of identifying the coronavirus, it was self-evident that no one could have died from it. That way we could have avoided all the hassles and economic hardships caused by lockdown. Far better for hundreds of thousands of people to have died from unexplained causes than to have inconvenienced those who either didn't get the virus or managed to recover. Both men were too canny to allow themselves to be drawn on why the government had tried to cover up the report or might be so uninterested in even sounding out the possibility of Russian attempts to interfere with the UK democratic process. Instead, they merely contented themselves with raising the odd eyebrow from time to time. It was the political equivalent of the dog that didn't bark in the night. AKA, never open an inquiry unless you know what you might learn first. And the Tories under both Theresa May and Johnson had had a pretty good idea of what they might find. Having insisted it had made no efforts to discredit the report before its publication, the government went out of its way to discredit it immediately afterwards. If there had been anything to investigate then it would have been hot on the case. So the absence of any investigation was a sure sign that nothing untoward had happened and that the Russians had dozed off during the Brexit referendum. Besides, why bother to drag up something that had taken place four years in the past and would cause more trouble? Any attempt to portray the government as colluding with the Russians was just a smear. If Boris was guilty of anything it was being asleep on the job. And since when was idleness a crime? If only the Americans hadn't had such a hissy-fit over Huawei, we could have happily ignored the Chinese too. Let bygones be bygones. ",-0.25,Negative
UK urges EU countries to ensure Britons living abroad can stay after Brexit,0,Neutral,"The UK government is launching a multimillion pound communications campaign to reach the estimated 1 million British citizens living in the EU to ensure they know what steps to take if they wish to remain in their host countries after Brexit. And it is urging all EU member states to accelerate the process to enable British nationals to secure their rights amid concern among campaigners that some countries have not yet even opened schemes for UK citizens. 'UK nationals living in the EU must be able to rely on the rights the withdrawal agreement gives them, just as EU nationals living in the UK can. 'We continue to call on the EU and member states to protect the rights of UK nationals with faster implementation, longer application windows and clear communications, as the UK has done for EU citizens in the UK,'said a Foreign Office spokesperson. Their call comes weeks after the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, wrote to the vice-president of the European commission, Maro≈° ≈†efƒçoviƒç, saying that while the UK had given EU citizens 27 months to apply for settled status, some EU member states were planning 'short application windows that may not allow sufficient time for citizens to secure their rights'ù. The EU has confirmed that 13 countries, including France, where many British nationals live, have opted for a 'constitutive'system similar to that in the UK requiring British nationals to apply for settled status. The remaining 14 member states have chosen the simpler 'declaratory'system that allows British nationals to register their residency to demonstrate their right to continue to live, work or study in their chosen country. Spain, where an estimated 400,000 Britons live, has opted for the latter, giving campaigners hope that few will be left behind. It has also launched what local British campaigners are describing as a 'warm'campaign, with the minister for inclusion, Hana Jalloul, telling Britons who want to remain that 'this is, and always will remain your home'ù. It coincided with a joint statement with the British ambassador to remind Britons their rights are 'guaranteed'if they are living there before 31 December. The country's national statistics show 360,000 British nationals have already registered to be in the country with 104,000 living in the Andaluc√≠a province, including 62,000 in the costas around Malaga. Alicante and Valencia account for a further 97,000, with 40,000 and 29,000 in the Canaries and Balearics respectively. Sue Wilson, the founder of Bremain in Europe, a campaign group for Britons in Spain, said the fact that the Spanish government have chosen a simple declaratory scheme allowing rights to be 'guaranteed'without an application for settled state a 'great relief to British immigrants'ù. 'We are grateful to the Spanish authorities for making the process as simple, seamless and painless as possible.'However, there is concern that there are tens of thousands of Britons who are off the radar, some elderly or vulnerable, and some who just don't use the internet who may be more difficult to reach. The Foreign Office is working with three organisations in the country, including Age in Spain, with a big communications push to try to reach the over-65s around the Costas and Alicante. 'I suspect a large number of people are out there who may not understand that there is an issue that they have to deal with because of Brexit, some of whom may not like to approach officials because they don't know or fear how it might impact on things like taxation, health care,'said Helen Weir, the director of Age in Spain. Weir also said there was an important message to get out to relatives back in the UK. 'If you have a relative in Spain who may not have residency or cannot cope with officialdom because they don't speak Spanish or because they can't cope with bureaucracy, you can contact Age in Spain and we can put them in touch with people who can help.'Of the 26 member states (Ireland is an exception, with British and Irish having reciprocal rights to remain in each others country after Brexit), Spain is considered one of the most advanced in preparations for the human cost of Brexit. France was due to open its application process on 1 July but has put it back to October because of Covid-19 and pressure will mount on countries to extend the deadlines for applications beyond 30 June next year to accommodate the challenges caused by the pandemic. So far, 14 countries have opted for declaratory systems, and some countries, including Sweden and Finland, which have opted for constitutive systems, have delayed the deadline for applications from June to October next year. Countries that have opted for the declaratory system are: Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain. The remainder have opted for the constitutive system. '¢ This article was amended on 20 July 2020 to clarify both which countries have opted for a declaratory system, and that some of those that have chosen the constitutive system have extended their deadline for applications.

"Bullying Xi, predatory Trump: where does Britain turn in a divided world?",0,Neutral,"Life after divorce can be difficult. Having cut ties with the EU, its partner of 47 years, Britain's new-minted relationship with China is in deep water. Tapping into Beijing's enormous economic power is vital to Brexit's success. But the relationship has soured. The spark has gone. The relatives don't approve. Harsh words are flying. Boris Johnson is accused of two-timing China by succumbing to American pressure to break it off and backing Donald Trump's electorally driven 'new cold war'ù. Johnson would surely rather have it both ways. But he knows a show of defiance could wreck his other Brexit passion: a spanking new trade deal with the US. What to do? Caught in this unlovely triangle, senior government officials are hedging their bets. On the face of it, they satisfied an importunate US last week by banning the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei from doing business in Britain. But as the Observer reports today, they have also privately indicated to Huawei that 'geopolitics'is to blame and the decision may be reversible. What does this actually mean? It means that while noisily collecting US brownie points, Britain is simultaneously telling the Chinese, sotto voce, that Trump is the problem. If Joe Biden replaces him in January, it's suggested, Britain would anticipate greater American flexibility - and a possible return to business as usual. Complicated? Yes. Geopolitics always is. Those claiming Brexit is 'done'ignore such ongoing strategic ramifications in an era of shifting power balances. Brexit's big idea was that 'global Britain'could chart its own independent, buccaneering course, trading freely with the world. Yet the emerging picture is of a diplomatically isolated, vulnerable country frantically juggling the conflicting demands of bigger players. Some say the curse of Brexit is upon us. Far from taking back control, Britain, further weakened by Covid-19, risks losing it altogether. It could be argued that the UK has been unlucky in its timing. The 2016 Brexit referendum and ensuing debate coincided with the unexpected advent of Trump and his xenophobic, unilateralist, divisive brand of 'America First'nationalism - and to some extent echoed it. Trump can be seen as an aberration. But his policies have undermined, perhaps permanently, the international rules-based political, economic and security order that Britain helped create and over which it has exerted disproportionate influence since 1945. Trump's disdain for shared western democratic values, alliances and laws has been deeply destabilising for the UK's traditional world view. This has placed US reliability in doubt and raised profound questions about the 'special relationship'- Britain's geopolitical bedrock. At the same time Xi Jinping, who effectively awarded himself power for life in 2017, was moving China inexorably away from the 'peaceful rise'stratagems of his presidential predecessors. Instead, he espoused an expansionist, more assertive international posture. This evolution may be seen in China's illegal seizure of control of the South China Sea, its escalating intimidation of Taiwan, its readiness to confront neighbours such as India, its online censorship, cyber-spying and indifference to criticism of abuses in Xinjiang and elsewhere. Xi would probably have made the shift sooner or later. But it seems to have been accelerated by Trump's 2017 designation of China as a 'strategic competitor'and 'economic aggressor'ù. Trump has since made his feelings known through protectionist tariffs, trade sanctions and his encouragement of sinophobia as a way of attacking Biden. As rivalry intensified, Xi unleashed a fierce counter-offensive by so-called 'wolf warrior'diplomats tasked with robustly projecting Chinese power. The UK is among those on the receiving end - the frequent target of insulting remarks by China's combative London ambassador, Liu Xiaoming. Two recent developments - Xi's security crackdown in Hong Kong and the culmination of US pressure on its allies to boycott Huawei - have plunged Britain into the centre of this geopolitical maelstrom. Yet its Janusian dilemma is not simply the product of bad luck. Problematic British economic and technological dependence on China is not a new phenomenon. But it is one that was long ignored out of political expediency and shortsightedness. Tory Brexiters who now portray Chinese companies as a dire security risk are the very same people who, when it suited them, painted a cosy picture of lucrative collaboration. Tories thought they were being clever by wooing Xi with a 2015 state visit and talk of a golden era, thereby showing a distant Barack Obama that Britain had strategic choices. There was little talk then of a Chinese threat. But David Cameron and George Osborne were geopolitical amateurs. Now, predictably, it's all gone pear-shaped. What's left is a post-Brexit UK global strategy that largely boils down to a risky gamble on expanding relationships with two superpowers that don't rate or respect Britain and which are fiercely at odds with each other. Johnson is reduced to playing piggy in the middle. How does Britain stop digging and get out of this hole? There is hope, if only because geopolitical calculations are constantly changing. Future trends are not all negative. And in terms of the specific Huawei and Hong Kong problems, still being a member of the EU would not have helped much. Brussels has huffed and puffed about China's disregard for international norms. But unlike Australia, no EU member state has yet joined Britain in extending a visa lifeline to Hong Kong citizens fleeing Beijing's chokehold. As for Huawei, there is no common EU position and no solidarity. The company claims to have lined up telecoms deals in numerous European countries. Some governments are reportedly waiting for Germany to make its decision, due in September. But chancellor Angela Merkel, attuned to Germany's vast export trade with China, seems unlikely to follow Britain and the US in excluding Huawei. In fact, she still hopes to convene a Covid-delayed EU-China summit within the coming year. Nor, if it can help it, will the EU take sides in the wider US-China brawl. Some states are already in bed with Beijing economically while others, though critical, are no friends of Trump's policy of belligerence. Italy joined China's Belt and Road global trade partnership last year, for example, while Greece promotes itself as China's import 'gateway'to Europe. France's president, Emmanuel Macron, prefers almost anyone to Donald Trump - even Vladimir Putin. All is not lost in Europe. There is no bar to Britain working cooperatively with individual European states on specific policy issues, as it has with France and Germany on Iran. There is talk, too, of forming a new grouping of 10 leading democracies, the D-10, a possible replacement for the discredited G-7. Britain's escape from diplomatic purdah may also be assisted by future changes in the US-China dynamic. A case can be made that Xi, for all his unmatched power, has overplayed his hand of late and may be forced to recalibrate - or risk losing ground at home. Trump's accusations over the origin and handling of the pandemic are but part of a larger battle. Rows with Australia over an international Covid-19 inquiry, with Canada over alleged hostage-taking, with India over a disputed Himalayan border, with Vietnam and the Philippines over maritime rights, and now with Taiwan and Hong Kong have created an impression of China versus the world. Its reputation has suffered. When the economic impact of the pandemic, the market-roiling US-China trade stand-off and increasingly strident western criticism about human rights abuses are factored in, it's not hard to imagine Xi quietly rowing back a little - which would potentially benefit Britain. Likewise, Washington's overbearing, predatory behaviour towards friends and allies may also change dramatically if Biden wins in November. The Democrat, mocked by Trump for being soft on China, has been more sharply critical of Beijing of late. Yet Biden's whole approach to foreign relations is summed up by the term 'strategic empathy'ù. He has spent decades as a senator and vice-president building bridges, not burning them. He knows China well. As some in Whitehall and Westminster seem to hope, his election could improve the geopolitical climate overnight. With a new president in the White House, there would still be tensions with Beijing. But talk of cold war would be likely to recede rapidly. Biden is an old hand. He knows the geopolitical game. And he believes in win-win outcomes. That's something the infinitely conflicted Johnson could learn from. ",-0.625,Negative
"If you don't profess undying love for Boris Johnson, he'll seek to destroy you",0,Neutral,"If a leader wants to rule as if he is ruling a one-party state, the first institution he needs to bend to his will is not the judiciary, civil service or free press but the ruling party. The party gave him power and could take it away. He must turn it into the equivalent of Vladimir Putin's United Russia or Donald Trump's Republicans and fill it with politicians too venal and frightened to challenge the boss. Boris Johnson may not know much but he knows about power. God help Conservative MPs who injure his bottomless vanity. They all now know they will not just lose the chance of a job in his cabinet or a retirement home in the House of Lords. Johnson will attempt to destroy them. At first sight, his failure to impose the hopeless Chris Grayling as chair of parliament's intelligence and security committee is one of the few merry moments 2020 has given us. 'Only Chris Grayling could lose a rigged election,'said the Westminster wags. Johnson did not realise until it was too late that a politician who could not park a car in an empty field would be outmanoeuvred. Say what you like about Julian Lewis, the Conservative MP who manoeuvred his way to the prize, but he understands defence and intelligence and is not a creature of Downing Street. His knowledge ought to have been a recommendation, given that the quid pro quo for granting the intelligence services more powers was granting the committee the power to scrutinise them. Johnson's reaction revealed his littleness. He stripped Lewis of the Tory whip. If he does not restore it, Lewis cannot retain his seat at the next election. Tory politicians now know that the price of angering the thin-skinned boss is a career-ending punishment. Johnson first expelled dissidents in September last year when he withdrew the Conservative whip from 21 MPs who tried to stop a no-deal Brexit. Johnson dismissed their defence that supporters of Brexit had never told the public in 2016 that crashing out of the EU without a deal was an option. (A point worth remembering as we could still crash out in January or leave with a deal so bad the result will be almost as dire.) He readmitted 11 before the 2019 election, as John Major had readmitted rebels who defied him before the 1997 election. Ten others, including David Gauke, Philip Hammond, Rory Stewart, Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve, remained banished. And that was the end of them. The attack on Lewis takes his mean-mindedness to a new level. Parties can reasonably expel MPs for repeatedly voting against the whip or refusing to support the manifesto. Lewis's crime was merely to win a committee chairmanship with the backing of MPs from other parties. Every chair of a parliamentary committee wants to be able to say they have the confidence of members from rival parties. It's almost part of the job description. Johnson's desire for retribution may not be sated. Tory MPs pointed me to an exchange in the Commons when Peter Bone for the Conservatives and Kevin Brennan for Labour asked Jacob Rees-Mogg to promise the government would not use its majority to remove Lewis from the committee. Rees-Mogg dodged their questions. Conservative politicians talk about Johnson with a venom few socialists can match. It's not that he's a criminal like Putin, they say. He doesn't have the balls to be truly evil. Rather, he is a pathetically insecure narcissist who turns on you if you don't feed his craving for applause. 'He's an abject, hectoring, incompetent show-off,'said one. 'If you don't love him or can't fake a love for him, he will go for you.'I learned this when I made disobliging remarks about Johnson for the right-leaning magazine Standpoint in the 2010s. After publication, I was trudging back from the supermarket when Johnson spotted me. He drove his bike off the road and on to the pavement straight at me. He was both angry - 'how could you write that?'- and pleading - 'you're really on my side, aren't you? Aren't you?'The concepts of the 'snowflake'ù, who cannot take criticism, and the 'cry bully'ù, who plays the victim as he lashes out, had not been invented then, which was a pity as I could have used them both. I later learned he had screamed at the editor for daring to run an article critical of the Churchill of our age. Frauds cannot stand the sight of honest men and women. They must surround themselves with counterfeits who reflect their dishonesty back at them. Britain has seen so many die during the Covid-19 pandemic, and will have a European deal that will kick a bleeding country when it's down, because Johnson forced competent and principled men and women out of the Conservative party or left them on the backbenches. He could not bear to be in their presence. And to be fair, they could not bear to be in his. The spite behind Johnson's attempts to manipulate scrutiny of the intelligence services appears a minor point given the scale of our troubles. But the devil, like God, dwells in the detail, and this scandal shows all Johnson's vices in miniature. He prevented the British from reading the committee's report on Russian interference in British elections before they voted in the 2019 election. Although the committee is the only means by which parliament can scrutinise the security services, Johnson showed his contempt for parliament and for accountability by refusing to allow it to meet from December 2019 to July 2020. When he could delay no longer, he tried to fix it by installing a courtier without knowledge of the intelligence services or any discernible qualities beyond a willingness to abase himself before Johnson. When the fix failed and the more deserving candidate won, he tried to destroy him. Such is our prime minister, ladies and gentlemen. Our best hope is that he is such a useless authoritarian he will destroy himself before he destroys everyone else. '¢ Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist ",0.875,Positive

Labour must find its radical voice again,0,Neutral,"Leadership is more than simply taking on board whatever a politician hears on the doorstep, as Lynsey Hanley eloquently points out (Labour will win by changing minds - not pandering to rightwing voters, 16 July). Not all doorsteps are the same. Doorsteps vary according to geographical location and income level. Views held by people on the doorstep may have a harmful effect, when put into practice, on the people espousing these views. Opposing EU freedom of movement is causing shortages of essential workers in the NHS and the care sector, and will badly hit those areas that voted leave. In the same way, the tariffs on goods likely to be imposed when Britain quits the EU will increase unemployment in the north and the Midlands. Progressive leadership means putting forward policies based on principles in a way that will command electoral support. This does not involve giving in to interest groups who peddle only their particular issues, however electorally important such groups are deemed to be. As Hanley points out, Labour has a proud history of championing causes ahead of public opinion - ending the death penalty and decriminalising homosexuality being just two. It's time Labour found its radical voice again.Mary HoneyballLabour MEP for London 2000-19 '¢ I found Lynsey Hanley's views on Keir Starmer's performance as Labour leader churlish and off the pace. Labour lost the moral and intellectual argument in the last election for a number of reasons, but it is obvious to all that large swathes of the electorate were worried by the programme it was putting forward, and even more had no confidence in Jeremy Corbyn. For many people, these doubts were powerful enough for them to hold their noses and vote Tory, despite the appalling record on austerity, Windrush, Grenfell, tuition fees, the gig economy, immigration cruelty etc.  Starmer has been left with a huge task, but he recognises that there is a reason why the expression is 'hearts and minds'and not the other way round. No matter how noble Labour's purpose, even Roy Jenkins would have been out of his depth in this age of socially engineered culture wars, data misuse, unregulated social media and global interference. Starmer needs to convince the 'sick of politics'man and woman in the street that he can be trusted first. In my view, he is making a very good job of it.David LowndesSoberton, Hampshire '¢ Martin Kettle (Liberalism is fighting for its life. There is only one way to survive, 15 July) makes the important point that the fate of the Liberal Democrats actually matters. The majority of general elections since 1945 have been decided by where the Liberal vote goes. Often this has been enough to deprive the Labour party of victory. Even at 8%, it will be enough to decide an election. If Labour is serious about winning, then the only strategy for the next election is a broad alliance (Labour/SNP/Lib Dems/Greens) based on a single issue: electoral reform. It should come with a commitment that a new election would be called six months later based on proportional representation. If Keir Starmer is not prepared to do this, the next election is already lost.Stephen DorrilNetherthong, West Yorkshire '¢ Martin Kettle writes that economic liberalism is under challenge from recession, climate change and nationalism. It's also under challenge because it doesn't work.

"Kent customs facility will also be used as lorry park, minister confirms",0.375,Positive,"The Department for Transport has signed off on the purchase of a vast site in Kent for a Brexit border facility and confirmed that it will be partly used as a giant lorry park just days after the cabinet ministerMichael Gove insisted that was not the 'intention'ù. The facility needs to be in place to accommodate checks for up to 11,000 lorries going to and from Dover and Eurotunnel in Folkestone every day. Rachel Maclean, MP and parliamentary undersecretary of state for transport, has also apologised to local residents in Ashford that they had to learn the news from the press. 'We sincerely apologise that information on this matter made its way into the press before we were able to communicate with you directly,'she said. 'We have not been able to inform you of our interest in the site before now for reasons of commercial confidentiality.'News of the plans for the 1.2m sq ft 'Mojo'site between Sevington and Mersham villages came out of the blue on Friday night, infuriating the local Conservative MP, Damian Green, who told Gove on Monday it was 'wrong-headed'to agree a secret deal with no consultation with locals. He demanded to know what 'environmental impact assessment'the government had conducted given the site was next to a planned housing estate and the local hospital. 'So many new houses are being built in that area and it will mean people are buying homes in good faith not knowing this was planned. 'It's also close to the William Harvey hospital, where any disruption to traffic in the local area could literally be fatal,'he told Kent online. Maclean has confirmed that the site will get approval via the secretary of state and not the usual local planning processes through what is known as a 'special development order'ù, or SDO. 'We can however now confirm that the Department for Transport (DfT) has purchased the site and intends to make use of it in the context of our planning for the end of the EU transition period,'she said. 'Our use of the site will require further planning consent, which the government intends to pursue by means of a SDO process,'she added. The site would be used both for customs clearance and as a holding pen for lorries if there was any congestion in Dover.  She said: 'First, government departments envisage using it as a permanent site for facilities related to future border processes, notably HMRC (as an office of departure/arrival for goods moved under 'òtransit' arrangements) and Defra (as a border control post for goods needing sanitary and phytosanitary checks). 'Second, the site may also be used as a contingency lorry holding area for the particular, foreseeable risk of significant disruption at the end of the transition period.'Locals expressed anger at the potential noise and air pollution with the 'stop-start'of lorries through the night and constant noise of refrigeration trailers. A Green party spokeswoman, Mandy Rossi, also expressed concern that the congestion on the roads would hold up ambulance services and could ultimately lead to the closure of the hospital as there is talk of a super-hospital to combine three A&Es in the county. The customs clearance site is needed from 1 January next year, when the UK leaves the customs union and the single market and all those who trade with the EU will require customs declarations in addition to other paperwork. HM Revenue & Customs estimates that 400m customs declarations will need to be processed a year but it only unveiled its detailed plans on Monday, less than six months before the most dramatic change to international trading systems since 1993, when the single market was introduced. Maclean told residents there would be no problems if businesses did their bit and got Brexit ready. 'Significant problems at the border are not inevitable if businesses take the action necessary to prepare for the changes to come,'she said. The government is expecting to purchase or lease between 10 and 12 sites across the country for Brexit border facilities, including sites near other ferry ports, including Holyhead and Portsmouth, in a £427m infrastructure programme. Gove confirmed on Thursday that the government had identified five sites in Kent where it intended to build new infrastructure to carry out checks A DfT spokeswoman said: 'This site will form part of our ongoing plans to help ensure the free flow of freight at the border as we make our new start at the end of the transition period.'",0,Neutral
The Guardian view on no visas for care work: adding insult to injury,-0.875,Negative,"In January, the Migration Advisory Committee laid out to government ministers some of the consequences of moving to a points-based immigration system. The social care sector, it pointed out, would be severely affected by new minimum salary thresholds, designed to keep out unskilled workers from abroad. This was because caring for the vulnerable and elderly was one of the most poorly paid occupations in the country, so foreign carers simply wouldn't make the cut. An existing recruitment crisis would be made worse. This week, in an act of cocksure recklessness startling even by this government's standards, the home secretary in effect said: 'Bring it on.'Setting out plans for a fast-track health and care visa for skilled foreign health workers, Priti Patel confirmed that British borders would, from 2021, be shut to the kind of low-paid care assistants who keep residential homes functioning. Roughly one in six staff currently working in adult social care are non-British. The decision to cut off this supply line of vital labour was taken during an ongoing global pandemic that, it is feared, could lead to a disastrous second wave of Covid-19 deaths this winter. Why generate a new crisis in a sector that has been shamefully mistreated during the coronavirus ordeal, and whose long-term structural problems have been a national scandal for 10 years? The answer is that the government appears to envisage the new rules as a kind of shock therapy. Taking away the possibility of employing cheap labour from abroad, it presumes, will force care providers to attract local workers by offering proper training, genuine career pathways and, above all, higher pay. These are laudable aims. But the notion that this can be delivered in the current context is dangerous and delusional. The long-term problems of the social care sector stem from the lack of a sustainable funding model and an excessive reliance on overleveraged private providers. Risible rates of pay have, in part, been driven by the need of large-scale chains to cut costs, pay back debt and deliver dividends. Meanwhile, local authorities, obliged for 30 years to outsource care provision to the private sector, have struggled to pay for it from shrinking, austerity-ravaged budgets. These are structural flaws in a broken system. They can only be addressed by a coherent government plan for social care reform and a new funding model. Without that, as providers and local authorities have repeatedly warned, a crisis risks turning into a catastrophe. The vast expense of dealing with Covid-19 has pushed many councils along the road towards bankruptcy. It has also confronted care home providers with an estimated £6.6bn worth of extra bills. Could there be a more inopportune moment to conduct a reckless midwinter experiment, in which inadequately financed care providers will seek to fill new gaps in rosters? Future shortages will impact on poorly paid workforces already exhausted by months of stress, some of it the direct result of misguided policymaking in Whitehall during the pandemic. Most importantly of all, the quality of care for millions of elderly and vulnerable people will inevitably be adversely affected. At the weekend, Care England, which represents 4,000 providers, wrote an open letter to Boris Johnson, beseeching him to make good on his promise to deliver a comprehensive plan for the future of social care provision. Still the country waits. What the government has offered instead adds insult to injury. Ms Patel has contrived to make a terrible mess even worse. ",0,Neutral
Northern Ireland businesses 'òmust get Brexit compensation',-0.125,Negative,"Northern Irish businesses must be compensated for the millions of pounds in extra costs they are expected to face to trade with firms in Great Britain after Brexit is completed, a group of MPs have said. As part of Boris Johnson's deal to avoid a border on the island of Ireland, businesses in Northern Ireland face checks and controls on all goods coming from the rest of the UK from January and are threatened with some checks going in the other direction. Business leaders have warned some firms could collapse under the weight of the costs, which will not be incurred by their counterparts in Scotland, Wales or England. A report by the Northern Ireland affairs select committee recommends that the government 'reimburses business for any new costs incurred'and clarifies urgently what new administrative requirements traders face. 'We are clear that UK businesses trading across the Irish Sea must not face new upfront or ongoing costs, as these would not be compatible with the government's commitment to unfettered access and to maintaining Northern Ireland's integral place in the UK internal market,'it adds. The government has said it will unveil what new controls will be mandatory in the coming weeks, but a recently leaked HM Revenue and Customs presentation to Northern Ireland businesses showed at least three layers of red tape would be imposed from January. The report also criticises the government for putting politics above business and local needs. It says: 'We remain to be convinced that the government fully understands that its political approach, apparently informed by limited understanding of how business works, provides neither the clarity nor the detail that Northern Ireland business requires.'Aodh√°n Connolly, the head of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium who is among those campaigning for mitigation and derogations, criticised the government's new Brexit campaign slogan 'Let's Get Going'as meaningless. Shadow Northern Ireland secretary Louise Haigh called for an urgent publication of the detailed processes that will apply to business in January.  'The government's careless approach risks a 'òperfect storm' for Northern Ireland with businesses unprepared for major new requirements with their largest trading partner, at a time when they are fighting to stay afloat during the Covid-19 crisis,'she said.  Going where is the question? Without mitigations we are going to a future of less choice & affordability for NI families when they shop, a future where some products and business models are unviable. It is not enough to have a slogan & believe Michael, you have to plan & deliver https://t.co/0UqLMpnhAd The select committee report also called for the work of the Brexit joint committee, chaired by Michael Gove and the European commission vice-president, Maro≈° ≈†efƒçoviƒç, to be made available to parliament for public scrutiny. It is charged with implementing the withdrawal agreement but its meetings are held in secret and minutes are not published. The Northern Ireland affairs committee says mechanisms 'must be established'to enable businesses in the region to engage with it and another specialised committee that feeds into it in order for it to be a 'constructive forum for genuine problem solving'ù. It also questions some of the pronouncements made by the government, including the declaration that 'exit summary declarations'that the EU requires on all goods leaving the bloc for a third country will be waived. The committee calls on the government to explain how ministers will guarantee that if they cannot get agreement from the EU. It says businesses need clear operational detail to be published by October 2020. ",0,Neutral
UK to open 10-12 Brexit border customs sites in EU trading shake-up,0,Neutral,"The UK government is to build '10 to 12'new Brexit border customs and controls sites across the country in a move that Michael Gove has said cements the mission to 'take back control'from the EU. In the biggest shake-up to trading with the EU for 50 years, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster announced the £470m programme for facilities to process freight going to and from the EU, along with a 206-page document detailing new border controls. Five sites are likely to be in Kent and are expected to be operational by 1 January, when the UK leaves the customs union and single market. They will handle up to 400m customs declarations a year, insiders said on Monday, with HM Revenue & Customs writing to 12,000 businesses trading with the EU - who up to now have not had to fill in customs declarations - warning them of the changes ahead. Gove told the House of Commons that January marked 'the next chapter of our history as a fully independent United Kingdom'ù, which could determine its own recovery path from Covid-19 without deferring to Brussels. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said that with this dramatic change to the trading regime announced just months before Brexit becomes operational, many businesses were wondering 'whether the oven was even turned on'when Boris Johnson promised voters his 'oven-ready deal'ù. She said government estimates of 400m customs declarations a year would add £12.8bn in costs to British business. The new trading system will be phased in over six months with checks on food and goods of animal origin, as well as customs declarations on imports and exports at the border by July. Government insiders warned the new systems and process would apply whether or not there was a free trade deal and said it was 'an important message'to get across to businesses. Extra layers of controls with veterinary certificates and health checks will be required for the import of food, live animals including racehorses and the wooden crates or pallets on which they are carried. If a trade deal is struck there will be additional checks on the origin of the goods and possible tariffs, depending on the agreement with the EU. Together they represent the reversal of 47 years of no trade barriers, including when the single market was launched in 1993. Gove insisted that the government was still in confidential 'commercial negotiations'for the Brexit border facilities including a 27-acre site on the outskirts of Ashford. The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain's entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a 'deep-seated hostility'towards the European project. With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home. The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted ""yes"". Margaret Thatcher, later to be leader of the Conservative party, campaigned to remain. Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the ""iron lady"" marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand 'our own money back'claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back'despite being one of the 'three poorer'members of the community. It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.† Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in 'embryo'ù. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU. Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was 'òno, no, no' to what she saw as Delors' continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch's Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered 'Up yours Delors'front page. A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of 'a single market without barriers - visible or invisible - giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world's wealthiest and most prosperous people"". Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.† Tony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers' rights. Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. 'Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,'he said in his maiden speech. 'The level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.'Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro. EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club. Anti-immigration hysteria seems to take hold with references to 'cockroches'by Katie Hopkins in the Sun and tabloid headlines such as 'How many more can we take?'and 'Calais crisis: send in the dogs'ù. David Cameron returns from Brussels with an EU reform package - but it isn't enough to appease the Eurosceptic wing of his own party The UK votes to leave the European Union, triggering David Cameron's resignation and paving the way for Theresa May to become prime minister After years of parliamentary impasse during Theresa May's attempt to get a deal agreed, the UK leaves the EU. He rebuffed demands from several MPs to name the shortlist of sites, causing anger at the lack of consultation with local communities over what many fear will lead to noise, air and water pollution. Damian Green, the Conservative MP for Ashford, asked Gove 'what environmental impact assessment has been done'for the proposed site in his constituency as it was next to planned housing and the local hospital. Government sources said some of the five sites in Kent would be holding pens, or lorry parks, and not facilities for checking customs, transit and health certificates. Sources in Kent believe Ebbsfleet International and the disused Manston airport near Ramsgate are under consideration for lorry parks in the event of congestion on the roads to Dover. Manston has recently been given the green light to reopen as an air freight cargo hub but could still be used next year as a contingency for traffic congestion on the roads to Dover. Tim Reardon, the head of EU exit at the Port of Dover, welcomed the confirmation of inland controls as gridlock was otherwise almost a certainty in the town. 'They've taken on board the key principles that they need to get the processes moved away from the border, but there is still a lot of work to be done to finalise everything,'he said. Many industry leaders have warned that the government has left the infrastructure and IT systems too late to develop, threatening chaos in the first few months of 2021 if lorries arrive in Dover or Calais without the right paperwork. The government has already delayed the implementation of full border controls for EU imports for six months because of the coronavirus pandemic. The plan has caused internal friction at cabinet level, with the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, last week protesting it would leave the UK vulnerable to smuggling and a legal challenge by the World Trade Organization. On Monday there wasfresh sabre-rattling from former Brexit campaigners on the Tory backbenches about the likely shape of an EU trade deal. They have seized on a report published by the new thinktank the Centre for Brexit Policy, which argues that the government could repudiate aspects of the withdrawal agreement if it believes the EU not to be using its 'best endeavours'to negotiate. The former Brexit minister David Jones, deputy chairman of the European Research Group, said the report had 'crystallised a whole range of concerns'among Conservative MPs.  In particular, they claim that EU demands of a 'level playing field'compromise UK sovereignty. The former Brexit secretary David Davis said the government should threaten to reopen the financial settlement between the two sides as a negotiating tool. 'We should say, 'òI think we need to talk again about the money,''he said. Another former minister, Iain Duncan Smith, said he was convinced ministers were studying the report seriously.  But asked whether the government was considering renegotiating the agreement, Boris Johnson's spokesman said on Monday: 'The prime minister already successfully renegotiated the withdrawal agreement, securing a new deal that works for the whole of the UK and moves us forward to a new partnership with the EU based on a comprehensive and ambitious free trade agreement.' Monday's document also reveals new customs declarations reminiscent of pre-duty-free days. From January, anyone carrying goods worth more than £1,500 in a small vehicle will have to declare the goods using the red channel, with additional controls for more than £10,000 in cash. This will apply to couriers who are transporting it on behalf of business. Customs forms will also have to be filled out for people receiving goods through the post that do not exceed £900 in value.

Brexit: UK's new fast-track immigration system to exclude care workers,0.125,Positive,"Care home staff have been excluded from a post-Brexit fast-track visa system for health workers, in a move that critics say could prove 'an unmitigated disaster'and may increase the risk of spreading coronavirus. Confirming there would be no special treatment for carers coming from the EU or the rest of the world, the government said it hoped Britons would fill a shortfall of around 120,000 workers, equating to 10% of all posts. Currently 17% of care jobs are filled by foreign citizens. Prof Martin Green, the chief executive of Care England, which represents the largest private providers, said the decicison, amid a pandemic in which 20,000 people have died in UK care homes, 'has the potential to destabilise the sector even further with potentially disastrous consequences'ù. The National Care Forum, which represents voluntary providers, said it could increase the use of agency staff, which as been shown to increase the risk of Covid-19 transmission. Details of the immigration system, which comes into force in the new year, were outlined in a 130-page Home Office paper. At a time of widespread appreciation for health and care staff during the pandemic, the government has offered fast-track entry under a 'health and care visa'ù, with reduced application fees and dedicated support to assist those applying and their families. But despite the name, the list of professions that can use the visa, set out in an appendix of the document, does not cover care staff. A Downing Street spokesman said: 'We want employers to invest more in training and development for care workers in this country. On care workers specifically, our independent migration advisers have said that immigration is not the sole answer here, which is why we have provided councils with an additional £1.5bn of funding for social care in 2021-22, as well as launching a new recruitment campaign.'Vic Rayner, the executive director of the National Care Forum, said that in London, where around 38% of care workers are non-British, the policy could be 'an unmitigated disaster'ù. 'We have 122,000 vacancies, growing demand for our services, and then the tap is turned off like this,'she said. 'It is not good news at all. What you need for good care is a stable, skilled and plentiful workforce. And in the context of Covid-19, where you are trying to minimise movement of staff, any shortages might increase movement of staff and use of agency staff, which we are trying to avoid.'Robin Hall, the secretary of Hampshire Care Association, said a shallower pool from which to recruit could drive up wages, which without greater public funding would mean fewer staff employed per resident. 'That will damage the quality of care we can deliver,'she said. 'You also may have to get less choosy about who you employ, and that's a dreadful thought. A lot of our EU staff are highly skilled. They are smart, articulate and speak three or four languages. We don't get that quality of applicants from the UK because of the status the profession has.'During Home Office questions in the Commons, Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, asked his opposite number, Priti Patel: 'What does the government have against care workers?'While a few very senior care roles in the NHS could allow arrivals to qualify for the visa, the minimum threshold is what is known as regulated qualifications framework (RFQ) level three or above, roughly equivalent to passing A-levels. The Home Office classes most care staff as being at RFQ one, equivalent to lower-grade GCSE passes. New overseas nationals will still be able to work in care, but only if they are dependents of someone else or have another type of visa, for example a student visa. Much of the rest of the Home Office document sets out in more detail previously announced elements of the new immigration regime, which will close UK borders to lower-paid workers or those who cannot speak English after the country leaves the EU. The new system has prompted warnings about a lack of seasonal farm workers. Arrangements have been made for seasonal harvest workers, but below levels that the National Farmers' Union has said are needed. The updated immigration document gives no new details on this, saying the sector will be reassessed at the end of this year after the end of a pilot scheme. The document outlines the first details of stringent English language tests that will apply to all immigrants. In future, arrivals will have to demonstrate language competency by showing they have 'passed a secure English language test'or that they 'meet the required level in a previous successful immigration application'ù. The document gives the first details of the government's 'global talent'route, which will be led by an Office for Talent based at 10 Downing Street. The system will encourage the arrival of not just scientists and engineers but also leading workers in the humanities and arts. Would-be arrivals can be processed rapidly if their application is endorsed by bodies such as the Royal Society, the Royal Academy of Engineering or Arts Council England. On deportation, the paper outlines what it calls a robust and consistent approach for people from the EU and elsewhere. Currently, EU nationals are only deported if they are deemed a threat to public security. Under the new rules, as with non-EU nationals, they will be considered for deportation if they are jailed for 12 months or more, or are serious or persistent criminals with shorter jail terms.

Holidaymakers urged to take out extra travel insurance post-Brexit,-0.75,Negative,"Ministers are urging people to take out comprehensive travel insurance if they are heading abroad from January as they announce plans to plough £700m into a new border strategy. From Monday a new marketing campaign to get the public prepared for life after the Brexit transition period will include TV, radio and digital adverts. Advice for people in Northern Ireland is set to follow in a few weeks' time as negotiations with the EU continue. As well as reminding people about insurance and checking passports are in date, the adverts will also be targeted at businesses exporting to or importing from the EU, reminding them to get an economic operators registration and identification number, or to register with the relevant customs authority. The new advice is part of the government's 'òThe UK's new start: let's get going' campaign. Holidaymakers will need to take out insurance that covers health as the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) will only be valid up to 31 December 2020. Anyone wanting to travel to Europe with a pet from 1 January 2021 needs to contact their vet four months in advance. Michael Gove has announced that the £700m investment in the UK's borders when the country leaves the single market and customs union on 31 December involves hiring 500 extra staff and building control posts. The financial package comes days after a leaked letter from the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, revealed her  concern that the country will not be ready by the time the transition period comes to an end. But Gove said GB-EU borders would be secure by the end of the year. 'Whether or not we secure a Canada-style trade deal with the EU during the course of negotiations that we are carrying out, we will be outside both the single market and customs union come what may,'he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. 'Government certainly needs to take some steps to make sure we are ready.'He denied the financial plans had come too late to be implemented by the end of the year. Meanwhile, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was reported to be poised to introduce tax cuts and an overhaul of planning laws in up to 10 new 'free ports'ù. Sunak is said to be planning to open bidding for towns, cities and regions to become free ports - where UK taxes and tariffs will not apply - in his autumn budget. The Sunday Telegraph said the ports would be fully operational within 18 months of the UK leaving the customs union and single market at the end of this year.The £705m package includes £235m for staffing and IT systems and £470m for port and inland infrastructure to ensure compliance with new customs procedures and controls.New border infrastructure will be built inland where there is no space at ports, while ports will get one-off financial support to ensure the right infrastructure is in place. On reports that the government has bought land in Ashford, Kent, to turn into an enormous lorry park - anticipating tailbacks as goods are checked at the border - Gove said that was not the government's intention. 'What we want to do is make sure freight travelling through Kent can get to Dover, on to the ferries and then into France as quick as possible. It may be the case that, not so much in Kent but elsewhere, that there will be specific pieces of infrastructure in order to smooth the flow of traffic,'Gove said. He said this was to avoid traffic jams and tailbacks on roads. The £705m relates only to the implementation of the UK-EU border, and the government is expected to publish specific guidance and measures for Northern Ireland later this month. In her leaked letter, Truss said she believed HMRC would apply the default EU tariff to goods in Northern Ireland on 1 January 2021, rather than a dual tariff system that the government has been trying to develop with a bespoke IT system. Gove was also questioned about why the prime minister had said in December 2019 there would be no checks at the border. He replied: 'There will be some checks from products of animal origin that go from GB to Northern Ireland but we want them to be as light-touch and as minimal as possible. You will not have customs officers saying 'òhalt'. What you will have are vets who will be suitably equipped in order to carry out surveillance.'",0,Neutral
"No-deal Brexit will raise cost of UK household staples, say retailers",0,Neutral,"The cost of household staples, ranging from meat and cheese to school uniforms and drinking glasses, will substantially increase if there is no Brexit trade deal, British retailers have warned. With just six months to go before the UK leaves the EU entirely by exiting the single market and the European customs union, retailers fear further damage to a sector already reeling from the coronavirus crisis, with 5,600 job losses announced on Thursday from Boots and John Lewis alone. In a report on the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the public should be aware that no deal will mean a hike in the prices of not just luxury goods but 'ordinary household goods that every consumer has to buy and replenish'ù. 'It's not foie gras that we're talking about, it's mince, it's cheese, it's oranges, you know,'said Aodh√°n Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium in a Brexit press briefing.  'It doesn't matter whether it's Great Britain, or it's Northern Ireland, the people who will suffer most because of these cost rises will be those people who are most economically vulnerable.'The BRC has calculated that beef, which is imported in huge quantities from the Republic of Ireland, will go up in price by 48%, with cheddar cheese, another staple imported from across the Irish Sea, expected to cost 57% more. Oranges from Spain will cost 12% more, while the price of cucumbers will rise by 16%. Trousers imported from Italy will have a 12% levy slapped on them , porcelain kitchenware will also go up by 12% and drinking glasses made in Poland up 10%. Connolly said it was a misunderstanding to think that retailers and their suppliers had built up 'huge Brexit war chests'and added that Covid-19 had exposed the fragility of the supply chain. 'The ability and bandwidth, both financially and time-wise, of retailers to deal with a no-deal Brexit at the end of this year has been greatly diminished,'he said. About half of all food consumed from restaurants or shops comes from the EU, with 30% of produce in supermarkets from the bloc. Trade deal talks continued this week in London, with the second face-to-face meeting between negotiators Michel Barnier and David Frost. Little was said to suggest that progress had been made and public pronouncements last week suggested they were a long way from a deal. Deal or no deal, the UK is facing a new trading regime from 1 January as the country exits the single market and the customs union, forcing customs and food health checks on goods entering the country. 'That is going to increase a level of friction that we haven't seen since 1972,'said the BRC trade expert William Bain. ",0.125,Positive
The playbook of rightwing nationalists,0,Neutral,"George Monbiot rightly draws our attention to the insidious rise of political authoritarianism in the UK (Trump and Johnson aren't replaying the 1930s - but it's just as frightening, 2 July). This is a trend that has been growing in the US and now appears to have taken root in our own democracy. It is characterised by mendacity and narcissism, traits that both Donald Trump and Boris Johnson share to varying degrees. Narcissists are unable to decentre from their solipsistic cognitions and emotions in a way that might enable them to see and feel others' points of view, and instead attempt to impose their own distorted realities upon others. Both Trump and Johnson use the same techniques: deny any reality that does not fit their self-centred distortions, and attempt to create an alternative reality through words that evoke emotions in the listener that chime in with their own prejudices. Covid-19 has shown us that an insentient organism is impervious to weasel words, and that denial or wishful thinking are unable to prevail upon it. At some point, reality will confront our deluded leaders. Now that we have a Labour leader who, by profession, is a champion of the truth, the likes of Johnson will be seen to be the charlatans they always were, and they will vanish along with the post-truth era they helped create. Dr Allan Dodds Bramcote, Nottingham '¢ Following on from Monbiot's argument, whatever the trappings of the new order, it represents a new form of the state, moving from what Michael Gove calls 'the Attlee settlement'of the postwar welfare state to the direct democracy Gove presented as 'the agenda for a new model party'in 2005. In this pamphlet, Gove, Carswell, Hunt and others proposed that in the national enthusiasm generated by leaving the EU, the state could be 'unbundled'in the way Thatcherism opened the old mixed economy to 'pluralism of provision'ù. This will consolidate the dominance of finance capital to create a corporate state in which transnational corporations provide cradle-to-grave health, education, social care and local environmental services.

"Amid the havoc wreaked by coronavirus, there is another danger we've forgotten",-0.5,Negative,"Do you have the bunting out and the fireworks primed for Independence Day, with 4 July designated as the moment England ends its long national hibernation and flocks to the pub? To the untrained eye, the choice of a Saturday for the great unlocking might seem a tad rash, when, I don't know, Monday was available to ease people in gradually. That point was put to Boris Johnson on LBC this morning, but he couldn't offer even an approximation of an answer. Which leaves us to conclude that his government of geniuses picked Saturday solely because of the pleasing headlines that the Fourth of July suggested - rather forgetting that this is the day when Americans celebrate their escape from the rule of a dysfunctional London elite headed by a man with more children than you could count and prone to gibbering in public. The date may yet acquire new notoriety if the grand English reopening comes to seem premature, given that coronavirus is still lethally active and the UK has one of the world's highest death rates. And yet 4 July does not mark this week's most reckless date. With much less fanfare, another milestone was passed, one that could wreak a havoc all its own - especially in combination with the pandemic. I'm speaking of 11pm on 30 June, the moment at which Britain lost the ability to seek an extension of the Brexit transition period. Unless we reach a new free trade agreement with the European Union in the next six months, we will be crashing out of the EU with no deal on 31 December. It seems like bad form to mention it now, when we have a deadly disease to contend with. That suits Johnson and Dominic Cummings well: they hope to bury the bad news of Brexit deep inside the coronavirus, calculating that any damage inflicted by the former will be concealed by the general trauma of the latter. 'Covid's created an excuse,'says one former Conservative minister. But the logic is perverse. Cummings may like the politics of crashing out under cover of corona, but anyone else can surely see that now is absolutely not the time to submit Britain to the economic shock of a chaotic break from our nearest trading partners. Recall that the Bank of England has warned that the UK faces its deepest recession since the Great Frost of 1709; that the OECD forecasts that the UK will suffer the worst recession in the developed world; that three quarters of UK  manufacturers expect to cut jobs this year. The layoffs have already started, with thousands announced this week, from Upper Crust to Airbus. When the furlough scheme ends, there'll be many more. Mass unemployment is coming; consumer confidence will shrink as those with money become ever warier of spending it. If, on top of all that, Britain leaves the EU without a deal, or a deal so thin it's barely better than no deal, it will fall as a blow to the skull of a man already bleeding. None of this is abstract. The government has already published the tariffs that would be imposed on basic food items necessarily imported from the EU. They would add 12p to a 500g bag of dried pasta, 4p to a tin of tomatoes: to some, that won't sound like much, but for those counting every penny it could make all the difference. If you're grappling with food poverty, an increase of 20% or more on staples will be ruinous. In normal times, charities might step in. But many of those are fighting for their own lives, their high street shops devastated by the collapse in footfall brought by lockdown. This is how the coronavirus and a no-deal Brexit compound each other, their combined damage greater than the sum of its parts. Ministers like to play down the coming Brexit pain, suggesting that since all industries are going to have to adapt to Covid-19, they might as well adapt to an EU crash-out while they're at it. But that's wrongheaded, not least because the two different crises will affect different sectors. Travel, tourism and the arts have been gutted by coronavirus, while manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and financial services stand to be hit by Brexit. 'It's two parallel shocks, rather than one shock that might conceal the other,'says Naomi Smith of Best for Britain. And do we really believe this government can handle two such seismic shifts at once? Consider this. Johnson has promised to create an entirely new IT system to check goods heading from the UK to the EU in time for 1 January 2021. But guess what? Exporters are getting worried that the new Goods Vehicle Movement Service won't be ready in time. The Road Haulage Association calls it 'a cocktail for potential disaster'ù, predicting chaos and delay at the ports. Not to mention the new paperwork that will be required from British companies shipping goods to Northern Ireland. Now remember that the government also promises to have its delayed track-and-trace app for coronavirus up and running by the winter. It's a brave citizen who reckons they'll succeed in one of these two massive IT ventures, let alone both. Brexit once dominated our politics; now it is barely mentioned. The Conservative landslide last December seemed to settle it. Many of the Tory MPs who would have raised the coming no-deal threat have been purged. Keir Starmer is wary of raising it: he has his eye on leave seats, and is in no hurry to play the diehard remainer. He didn't even press the government to seek an extension to the transition. The result is a double danger to this country. A hurricane is coming, and yet we are blithely choosing this of all moments to sail off into uncharted waters, all alone.

'Office for talent' to be set up for scientists who want to work in UK,0,Neutral,"Downing Street is to set up a cross-departmental unit called the 'office for talent'as a way to help leading scientists, researchers and others live and work in the UK in the post-Brexit immigration system. The plan, which the Liberal Democrats said was simply trying to make up the damage caused by Brexit, is intended to 'ensure excellent customer service across the immigration system'ù, a government announcement said. The news came as part of a wider package of measures to encourage research and development, unveiled by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), itself an element of Boris Johnson's wider 'new deal'for post-coronavirus economic recovery. The office for talent will be based inside No 10. Dominic Cummings, Johnson's chief adviser, has in recent months sought to centralise more elements of ministerial work around No 10. Officials say the office for talent will involve the Home Office, BEIS and other departments, with Downing Street coordinating its function. In connection with a £300m commitments to improve science labs across the country, the office for talent is billed as making it 'easier for leading global scientists, researchers and innovators to come to the UK'ù. Intended to assist students and those at the start of their careers, as well as established experts, the office will start work immediately to make sure the immigration system for such people is 'simple, easy, and quick'ù, and also sell the UK as a place to live, the announcement said. International students who complete a PhD in the UK from next year - when the new immigration system will be in place - will be allowed to stay in the UK for three more years. Under existing plans, undergraduate and master's students can remain for two years. Other changes to help bring in students and researchers will include making the visa application time period longer and allowing people to switch the type of their visa while staying in the UK. Under the post-Brexit immigration system, students and staff from EU countries who are not already in the UK will need to seek entry under the same points-based rules as nationals from other countries. A series of groups representing scientists have warned that leaving the EU, particularly with no formal deal, would gravely harm science and research in the UK. Layla Moran, the Lib Dems' education spokeswoman, said Johnson's idea of an office for talent was 'nothing but compensating for the fact we will lose our valuable friends and neighbours help in the science community, especially if he pursues a no-deal Brexit'ù. She said: 'Placing the office in No 10 is just another pandering play to puppet master Dominic Cummings. If Johnson is serious about the science he'd make sure we work with talent across the world not just in his new office.'",2,Positive
The Tories want a culture war - but most voters aren't thinking about statues or Churchill,-0.25,Negative,"Whatever the pandemic has changed about British politics, one rule, forged four years ago in the Brexit referendum, still stands. The former 'red wall'seats in the north and Midlands, which turned blue in December, hold the key to governing Britain. These voters loom at the forefront of both parties' strategies. The Conservative party need lose only 41% of the voters it won from Labour to lose its majority in the 2024 election - a far smaller amount than the 64% of more liberal-minded Conservatives in the south that would need to be lost for the same to happen. As Johnson prepares to deliver his vision for Britain after coronavirus, it will be key that both Labour and the Conservatives avoid making lazy, outdated assumptions about these voters. A Brexit deal is gradually looking more likely. But in the event one is not possible this year, some in Conservative circles think that bringing Brexit back to the fore with an old-fashioned leave v remain battle over the end of the transition period will fuel support among red wall voters, and return them to the Conservative camp after a spot of pandemic-related wavering. In reports that No 10 views Keir Starmer as a 'remainer lawyer'ù, we may have seen a flavour of how the Conservatives plan to use Brexit to attack the Labour leader. But this approach fundamentally misunderstands how these voters view the world. Red wall voters aren't Brexit culture warriors of the sort we see amplified on social media. Yes, they mostly voted leave in 2016. They wanted the result respected, and voted to get Brexit done in December. Yet the reason the Conservative party was so successful in the 2019 election was not because its campaign stoked Brexit divides, but because it captured an overriding feeling that people were sick of hearing about Brexit. Anyone who conducted focus groups during that election will tell you that it was the desire to 'get Brexit done'that dominated discussion about Europe, not traditional battle lines pitting remain against leave. It was not a Brexit culture war that captured the red wall, but a Brexit boredom war, one that - despite the shrillness of social media - tapped more into consensus than division. And research suggests this issue is becoming less relevant to these voters. In the most recent Issues Index by Ipsos Mori, only 6% cited Brexit as the number one issue facing the country, compared with 44% in December 2019. There may be more risk to focusing on Brexit than gain: in a recent survey by Kekst CNC, 68% of participants said the government should focus on coronavirus rather than Brexit. Brexit is not the only possible culture war in town. Some have suggested that No 10 is actively looking for a fight on cultural and identity issues, seeking to drive a distinction between Tories and Labour for red wall voters - whether on statues, trans issues, or the right to tell offensive jokes. On the surface, this approach feels like it might work. Paula Surridge of Bristol University has shown that 2019 Conservative voters are united in their social conservatism, while Labour is more vulnerable as its voters are split. But polling on these issues sets up a divide that might not be at the front of people's minds. Britain is not the US, where polarisation among politicians has translated into polarisation among the public. In focus groups I have conducted over the last few years, statues, transgender toilets and no-platforming barely register. Most people do not know what 'woke'even means. Views are also more mixed than many assume - in my focus groups, people criticised both protesters and Dominic Cummings for breaking lockdown rules, not one or the other. For the sake of Labour's electoral fortunes, if the Conservatives do pursue a culture war, the opposition should not take the bait. Years of prominence may mean that, as in the US, the debate becomes embedded in the public consciousness - and as Surridge's analysis shows, that will be to the advantage of the Conservatives. Tony Blair recently said the Labour party must avoid launching 'politically into a kind of culture war'ù, and that the party would have a far better chance of delivering social progress if it bided its time and changed things from office. It already looks as if Labour may be learning this lesson. Two weeks ago, the Sunday Times splashed on No 10's plans to scrap an amendment to the Gender Recognition Act that would have allowed people to change their gender on their birth certificate without a medical diagnosis. It had all the makings of a week-long row, but Starmer sidestepped the issue. The beat of the Conservatives' culture war drum quickly died out. Other issues will determine who will win these red wall voters. Fairness is their lodestar. They feel they work hard day in, day out, but do not get the same treatment as others - be it benefit claimants, big companies, or tax dodgers. This feeling existed long before Brexit or the toppling of monuments, and need not be Conservative territory. It explains why the majority of red wall voters supported Brexit in 2016, but also why they voted for Ukip in 2015, why some voted Liberal Democrat in 2010, and why almost all opted for Labour in 1997. Whichever party owns that fairness agenda - whether through the NHS, immigration, the cost of living, or some new issue we don't yet know - will win the future. Tomorrow Boris Johnson will distance himself further from austerity in a speech setting out the future of the UK's economy. No 10 is already rewiring the civil service, and billions of pounds of investment for the north and the Midlands is set to be announced. In this climate, Starmer should be much more concerned by how people in the former red wall respond to Johnson's pledge to 'build, build, build'than what they think of Winston Churchill.

"We are what we eat, so we're right not to trust what goes into American food",0,Neutral,"One in six Americans fall ill every year from the food they eat (according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). In Britain, it is one in 28. This week, the negotiations over the shape of the final relationship between Britain and the EU resume in earnest, making the next three or four months among the most fateful of our lives. The grandstanding is over. And food quality, standards and security are going to become flashpoints. Will Boris Johnson's government stick to keeping us relatively healthy by making legal commitments to maintaining food standards in a UK-EU trade deal, as British farmers, supermarkets and consumers want it to? Or will it instead prefer no deal or a minimalist one, moving to American food standards in its much coveted US trade deal, protesting all the time that we must trust it to keep its word on standards even though it refuses to offer legislative guarantees? After all, the democratic mandate is clear: Britain voted to leave the EU and voted for a Johnson government. If the price is living with vastly more gut illness, a collective rise in obesity and shorter life expectancy - so be it. For the passionate Brexiter, it's the price for becoming global Britain and more fool us for believing their promises. The government is plainly trying to keep its options open - maybe permissive deals can be struck that will give both the EU and US some of what each wants. But no minister dare admit the obvious - that no trade deal with the US will pass US Congress unless there are major concessions to American big food. The US food trade associations that represent big food have enormous lobbying power. This industrialisation of American farming, with its disregard for animal welfare and for the impact of fertilisers and chemicals (many banned in the EU) on food standards, delivers production results, whatever else. The US produces low-grade, low-cost food in ever greater volumes, with booming exports mainly to less developed countries that cannot afford to be too discriminatory. Midwestern states are over-represented in the US Senate. Their senators will not pass a UK trade bill that does not open up the greatest prize ever - a bridgehead into Europe, a market hitherto denied. Indeed, with opening up the NHS to American healthcare now political dynamite after Covid, food is virtually the only major area on which the UK can offer concessions. That it has come to this shows how out of step the Brexit Tory party is with core British values and public opinion, deluded by success in very particular and one-off elections. It was hostility to Jeremy Corbyn that gave Johnson his victory in December, rather than any love of Brexit. Equally, though Leave won the referendum, there was no popular support for the real Brexit mission - importing alleged American capitalist dynamism and killing off the postwar settlement. For Britain remains stubbornly European in its values, despite the onslaught that tries to Americanise us. We believe in a universal welfare state, together with progressive taxes to pay for it, and in the NHS in particular. During the pandemic, most Britons have been prepared to accept the privations of lockdown for the greater good. We look in amazement at American, gun-toting, libertarian militias campaigning against lockdowns and grimly note that having opened up too early, especially in the south, the US has a Covid-19 infection rate climbing back to its highs. For nearly three months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said nothing about Covid-19, for fear of outraging Donald Trump. We want none of that, the whole American approach to public health, including the mores and standards of the US food business. British supermarkets, close to the consumer, have got the message. Last Thursday, Waitrose's executive director, James Bailey, declared: 'It would simply be wrong to maintain high standards at home yet import food from overseas that has been produced to lower standards.'Referring to animal welfare, he added: 'We would be closing our eyes'¶ to animals who are out of our sight and our minds.'Tesco, Sainsbury and Morrisons have all made similar commitments, while even Lidl and Aldi, a little warier, as cut-price supermarkets, have nonetheless offered emphatic support to British farmers and farming standards. The National Farmers' Union has campaigned throughout the passage of the agricultural bill for the government to promise maintained standards - to deaf ears. Then there is the security of supply: 40% of the vegetables and 37% of fruit we eat is imported from the EU. Brexiters like to deny geography, but vegetables and fruit perish. They can't be sourced in the US. Worse, if there is no deal with the EU, the whole British food supply chain, with its just-in-time delivery and suppliers all over the EU, will disintegrate. The EU food industry says there must be no tariffs and no quotas if the system is to continue operating. But that means food standards have to be the same so that zero-tariff food is interchangeable. If we want to eat fresh fruit and vegetables, eat meat from animals that have been well treated and chicken that has not been washed with chlorine, while also ensuring there is food on supermarket shelves next year, Britain has to have the same standards as the EU. And no meaningful US trade deal. On this there can be no ifs, buts or qualification. We are all Brexiters now, even moderate former pro-EU Tories tell me. Really? Geography, values and hard economics, represented by what we eat, are brutal. Britons are Europeans and trying to reinvent us as wannabe Americans will doom the Brexit Tory party. The only question is how long will it take. '¢Will Hutton is an Observer columnist ",-0.25,Negative
Britain's persistent racism cannot simply be explained by its imperial history,0,Neutral,"The question of empire has become central to discussions of Britain's national past. Some see residual imperialism as the prime element in a deficient, delusional, racist culture. Others think emphasising the dark underside of empire is an attempt to erase British history. The problem is that although long historical tradition sanctions criticism of imperialism, national history has proved far more resistant. Talk of empire is now omnipresent, but it was previously written out of history. In the 1940s the unashamed imperialist Winston Churchill didn't offer an imperial history of the second world war, or even a national one, but an Anglo-American, cold-war version of events in his six-volume work, The Second World War. Subsequently, what's striking about postwar historiography is the lack of imperialist histories and the absence of condemnation for nationalist and anti-imperial forces. At most there were sotto voce claims that the British empire should have done a deal with Adolf Hitler in 1940 to keep itself alive. More importantly, national histories ignored empire altogether. The reason is easy to find: after the war, a new nation arose that wanted to tell a national, not imperial, history of itself. This story was about the dawn of the welfare state, the Labour party and the National Health Service. This country's ancestry lay in the industrial 19th century, but it only became a true nation in 1940, during the Battle of Britain and the blitz. Putting the empire in its proper historical place is hugely important for understanding the sheer scale of slavery, the racialised nature of the imperial project, and how this project shaped the Conservative party into the 1950s. For much of the elite, the UK was seen as a part of something far bigger: the empire. This is why we have an Imperial War Museum and an Imperial College, and why the head of the army was called the chief of the imperial general staff. Britain's second world war, as it was understood at the time, involved the whole British empire (and many, many allies). In 1940, no one in authority could say 'Britain stood alone'ù. If anything was alone, it was the entire empire. It's also important to remember the important role anti-imperialism played for radical liberals and socialists. Radical liberals in 19th-century Britain criticised imperialism as the cause of unnecessary wars, and for sustaining a useless elite. More recently, the British centre-left has cited imperialism as the cause of war, militarism, nuclear weapons, economic decline, the failure to join the common market in the 1950s, and the failure to adapt to it since. For some historians, the demons and ghosts of empire are the spectres driving contemporary racism and Brexit, too. The UK, according to these critics, seems perpetually trapped in an Edwardian imperial mindset. Blaming empire is a deep-seated reflex that feels reassuringly progressive. But it has also been a way to avoid confronting things that lie a little closer to home. It has long been easier, and less morally and intellectually contentious, to castigate the actions of the British state and elite in faraway colonies than confront their actions at home. Far too many ills of past and present are lazily laid at this door. To make empire the dominant story in British history is to misunderstand the nature of Britain, its elite and its exploitative power, and its persistent racism. The racism of Oswald Mosley and Enoch Powell, for all its roots in the past, was a self-consciously post-imperial nationalist one. Imperialism reluctantly granted British Caribbean people UK citizenship. These rights were stripped away by nationalists, right down to Theresa May - this was the essence of the Windrush scandal. People voted for Brexit not because they were imperialists, but because they were nostalgic for a national Britain. They were certainly not voting for the return to free immigration from the old imperial territories. The history that seems to matter most to Brexiteers is a particular account of the second world war, one that is decidedly nationalist. Empire has only ever been part of the British story, but it can never stand for the whole. Even at its peak, it represented only a fraction of Britain's relations with the rest of the world, not least in war, but also in trade. From the late 19th century onwards, the Caribbean empire was tiny in terms of trade and population compared with Canada and Australia. In population numbers, India accounted for four-fifths of the entire empire, but trade with India was significantly less important than trade with the dominions. And the history of migration to and from the UK stretches wider than the empire, too - with people flowing into and out of the country to the US and from Europe. Britain's global history, in other words, is not the same as its imperial history. If we want to look for great silences in our history, empire is hardly the only one. There has been a glaring hole where the history of British capitalism and the British capitalist class should be; in its place are overwrought stories of decline and of imperial finance. The neglect of the British working class is particularly stunning. Giants of (anti-imperialist) postwar history such as EP Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm made this their field, and inspired countless others in a historical endeavour that peaked in the 1970s, but has since decayed even more rapidly than the industrial working class. Around 1900, Britain's industrial proletariat was one of the three largest in the world, comparable to those of the US and Germany. The British working class alone accounted for roughly 30% of the population of the entire empire outside India, and a far higher proportion of those producing for capitalist markets. There are many aspects of British history - many dark sides, too - other than imperialism. We should not admit the framing of the debate about history as a question of a dark imperial history sullying a bright national story. To do so would be to ignore a more difficult truth: all our national history needs rethinking.

Battered Britain is in no state to withstand a no-deal Brexit,0,Neutral,"My colleague Andrew Rawnsley and I have both drawn attention to the catastrophe that could have occurred during the pandemic if supply lines had not been preserved through Britain's membership of the European single market. True, there was panic buying and there were some shortages; but the worst fears were not realised. This was almost certainly because there were none of the kind of bureaucratic holdups that would have occurred if we had already departed from the customs union and, more importantly, the single market. There were reports of a U-turn last Friday. Thanks to desperate pressure from the business world, and an injection of common sense into the Cabinet Office, the government is planning to relax border checks temporarily on goods entering the UK from 1 January 2021, whether or not there is a 'deal'ù. Yet although we are enjoying a period of grace, one sentiment still rings out loud and clear: this demented government is determined to leave the single market come what may. The negotiations are stalled. As the EU's long-suffering and intrepid negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said: 'In all areas, the UK continues to backtrack on commitments undertaken in the political declaration.'Why? The UK's chief negotiator, the stolid David Frost, recently made clear that, in insisting on favouring 'sovereignty'at the expense of guaranteed economic damage, he is, to coin a phrase, only obeying orders. These orders come from Central Control. As Brendan Donnelly, a veteran observer of the UK-Brussels relationship, says in the Federal Trust thinktank's June bulletin: 'Brexit is the central and only unifying goal of today's Conservative party.'A once-great British party is now in the hands of the 'European Research Group'- loads of prejudice, but not much research - with one of its leading lights, Jacob Rees-Mogg, appointed leader of the house. Donnelly warns: 'It is a fundamental category mistake to think that Johnson could ever be able or even wish to emancipate himself from the ERG '¶ The ERG is now the Conservative party and the Conservative party is the ERG.'The 20.4% fall in GDP in April confirms that we are already in the worst depression in our history. Yet Johnson, the egregious Dominic Cummings and their cronies take the view that a no-deal Brexit would be lost in the continuing economic horrors of the pandemic. They laugh at the warnings of the head of the Confederation of British Industry, Carolyn Fairbairn, that business, already battered by a government-imposed clampdown, is woefully unprepared for no-deal. They are impervious to the drastic impact. They do not care. They see sunny uplands ahead for global Britain. Unfortunately, given the US-led rise of protectionism, and the breakdown of the postwar international order, these uplands lie in Aristophanes's cloud cuckoo land. Here we are, with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecasting something like a 12% drop in GDP this year, and every expert I know predicting carnage this autumn as decent companies crippled by the lockdown fail and unemployment soars. I have every sympathy with those who argue that this ought to be a 1945 moment: we need vision from our leaders to deal with the modern equivalent of William Beveridge's goals, as encapsulated by the title of his book Full Employment in a Free Society (1944).  Years of needless austerity, compounded by the social problems highlighted by the epidemic, have brought all manner of issues to the surface. Economists are generally agreed that there is such a thing as 'market failure'ù, so that certain utilities and services are best provided by the public sector. But as the economist Amos Witztum points out in The Betrayal of Liberal Economics: 'The problems which societies face are more acute when markets actually work well than they are when there is something which impedes their operation.'Thus, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, full rein was given to market forces, with the result that the very rich are not only, in F Scott Fitzgerald's phrase, 'different from you and me'ù, they are obscenely so, while at the other end of the scale there is much work for a modern-day Beveridge still to do. Johnson is not a modern-day Beveridge. He is obsessed by pursuing a policy of self-harm for the British economy via Brexit. And, to that end, he has packed his cabinet with fellow Brexiters. As my old friend David Gilmour, historian of Italy and keen student of cabinet history, says: 'All previous prime ministers, including Margaret Thatcher, selected talented people even when they disagreed with them. I cannot think of a western European premier since Mussolini who has surrounded himself with so many mediocrities.'",-0.125,Negative
Brexit: UK drops plans for full border checks on goods from EU,0.875,Positive,"The UK government has dropped plans for full border checks on goods coming in from the EU from 1 January 2021 over fears of the economic impact of coronavirus. Ministers will unveil plans for Brexit borders on Friday afternoon that will represent a significant shift from the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove's declaration in February that border checks would be inevitable for 'almost everybody'who imports from the EU from next year. Customs controls, whether there are tariffs or not, were expected in both directions of trade across the Channel, as well as regulatory and health checks. But ministers are now expected to adopt a more flexible approach on goods entering the UK to prevent the departure from the EU compounding the chaos from Covid-19. A government source said: 'We recognise the impact that coronavirus has had on UK businesses, and as we take back control of our laws and our borders at the end of this year, we will take a pragmatic and flexible approach to help business adjust to the changes and opportunities of being outside the single market and the customs union.'The announcement is expected after a meeting of the EU-UK joint committee headed by Gove and the European commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic, which convenes for the second time on Friday. The committee was set up to implement and enforce the withdrawal agreement. Talks over trade and the UK's future relationship with the EU have stalled, and Boris Johnson is to hold a virtual summit with EU leaders on Monday in an attempt to break the deadlock. He will meet Ursula von der Leyen, Charles Michel and David Sassoli, presidents of the European commission, council and parliament respectively. The UK and EU have agreed to an 'intensified timetable'for the trade talks, which will involve a mix of formal negotiating rounds and smaller group meetings, both in London and Brussels. There will be negotiations each week for five weeks, beginning on 29 June - an accelerated timetable after meetings in the last round of negotiations took place every two to three weeks. The UK has said it will walk away from the talks if there is no sign of progress in July. This week, the paymaster general, Penny Mordaunt, who is Gove's de facto deputy on Brexit implementation, said they would be telling the EU at the joint committee that the UK had no intention of availing of its legal right to a one-off request for an extension to the transition period, which ends in December. UK negotiators hope the Johnson and Von der Leyen summit will pave the way for a compromise, in the same way as the prime minister's walk in the woods in the Wirral with the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, led to a breakthrough on the Irish border last October. UK negotiators have said it is impossible to strike a deal with the EU under the present mandate of the bloc's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and want him to be given new instructions that will accommodate compromise. The UK is looking for compromises on the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, demands for a level playing field on the environment, workers' rights and state subsidies for companies. Senior negotiating sources have said if there is not progress in July, the UK is prepared to walk away, arguing that an autumn deal would be too late for the country to prepare for the full exit from the EU's single market and customs union on 1 January. They say there is no halfway house on EU demands over the European court of justice, and the UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, has described the EU's approach to a fishing deal as a 'non-runner'ù.

The Guardian view on foreign policy after Brexit: a dangerous void,-0.875,Negative,"No one who has paid attention to Brexit rhetoric in recent years is surprised that negotiations over a trade deal are failing. Nor does anyone expect progress by the end of this month, when the deadline for seeking an extension to transitional arrangements expires. Penny Mordaunt, the paymaster general, this week became the latest minister to restate the government position: no extra time will be sought, and if there is no deal, so be it. And so the familiar machinery of parochial bluster cranks into gear again, sounding just as it did in the run-up to past Brexit deadlines. On each previous occasion, the UK climbed down, although last autumn Boris Johnson exploited Tory MPs' ignorance and fatigue to sell his capitulation (over an Irish Sea border) as a victory. Of the people who were taken in by that ruse, the most important was Mr Johnson himself. The prime minister believes his own propaganda about brinkmanship forcing the EU to make concessions, and expects the same to happen this autumn. The EU does indeed want a deal. Some room for compromise can be read between the lines of Michel Barnier's unyielding assessments of talks. The obstacle is not continental readiness to grant Mr Johnson the kind of Brexit he demands, but Mr Johnson's readiness to engage with the detail. Downing Street's explicit willingness to surrender access to EU markets for regulatory sovereignty may be economically unwise, but it offers strategic clarity. That trade-off simplifies the goal compared with more convoluted hybrid models sought by Theresa May. But Mr Johnson never worked through the consequences of the exchange when he advocated it behind Mrs May's back. Since then complacency and coronavirus have stopped him doing his homework. As a result, the UK has no strategic concept of post-Brexit relations with the EU, even with a trade deal. The economic plan is to advance into other global markets and 'industries of the future'where regulatory standards will be set in London, not Brussels. In that vision, the EU is supposed to decline and watch Britain's newfound dynamism with envy, or to thrive in some convenient way that involves buying British exports and not competing with British industries. It is a fantasy that cannot survive prolonged exposure to cold economic winds blowing in behind the pandemic. The EU is not overly intimidated by Eurosceptic threats to collapse talks, since the harm that would inflict is greater on the British side. But there is concern about the longer-term consequences of Britain injuring itself in that way, sacrificing its own economy on an altar of national pride, and the incentives that generates to shift blame on to foreign neighbours and burn old alliances. The prospect of a disastrous Brexit sending the UK on to a rogue trajectory through the next decade is discussed in Paris and Berlin, even if in Westminster few want to engage much beyond next week. Only a few months remain if a deal is to be signed and ratified before the end of the year. There are too many variables to predict any outcome with confidence. A recession might focus minds on compromise or provoke Tories into a scorched-earth approach to old trading ties. The US presidential election in November will change global power balances whichever way it swings. The current danger is that Britain is working its way through this uncertainty hand to mouth, chasing a fairytale of global renaissance while ignoring inconvenient evidence. Our negotiating partners can see the delusion, but their leverage is limited. It is not too late for Mr Johnson to arrive at a more realistic appraisal of his options, but he must first lift his eyes to a strategic horizon, and there is not much sign that he is even capable of focusing that far ahead.

It is up to Labour to lead the charge against Johnson's looming shock doctrine,-0.625,Negative,"If you relied only on common sense and the average news coverage, you could be forgiven for underestimating the scale of the crisis that is about to unfold. The news is full of scandals about advisers undertaking implausibly long-distance eye tests and, after such a shattering human tragedy, it does not emotionally feel possible that the world is about to experience its worst economic collapse. The fact that we may be just 10 years from the tipping point for catastrophic, runaway climate change is even more unfathomable. In this moment of convulsion, in which we will most need our compassionate and internationalist instincts, so much of the world is being ruled by nationalist demagogues. In their hands, this crisis will become a setting for shock doctrine and the UK will be at the sharp end. Brexit gives Boris Johnson an opportunity to reshape the British economy, signing trade deals with Donald Trump and scrapping rights and protections for workers, consumers and the environment. The rights of millions of migrants are also set to be downgraded and EU negotiators are alarmed at how determined the UK seems to be to opt out of some human rights protections. There was a brief moment, between the 2019 election and the coronavirus crisis, when it looked safe to predict that Johnson's Conservatives would be a wholly different kind of opponent to that of the austerity Tories. They would combine a more brutal regime for migrants and a deregulating trade policy with big state spending and investment. Now, as they seek to claw back £337bn from public spending, it looks possible that their time in government will be marked by a newer and nastier austerity. Labour and the wider left have a huge task ahead of them. By 2024, it will be too late to undo much of the damage. A movement of resistance against the onslaught on jobs and public services, on migrants and many basic rights and protections, will have to be urgently built. In the Jeremy Corbyn years, social movements and industrial action tailed off. The left will now have to take its demoralised activist base from cheering on the old Labour leadership to organising protests against NHS privatisation, strikes against a new wave of cuts, rent strikes and direct action in a matter of months. As well as mobilising big numbers, any new movement will need to be disruptive and militant if it is to be effective. Sooner or later, this situation will leave Keir Starmer in an awkward position. On one hand is his instinct to be cautious, and his respectability offensive aimed at winning over middle-ground voters. On the other, his promise to stay true to the radical policies of the Corbyn period, to inspire voters and to be in tune with the grassroots of the party. If he opts for an approach anything like that of Ed Miliband, who infamously refused to back strikes during the anti-austerity movement of 2011, his credibility and popularity will be shattered. To navigate the coming storm, the left will have to be bold, but so too will the Labour leadership. Starmer must situate Labour as the centre of a wider movement against the new austerity and the Tories' Brexit plans and he must go on the offensive. As Starmer himself has argued, there was never anything to be gained by Labour giving ground to rightwing narratives about immigration. And there is no public support for cuts or for economic deregulation. Every attempt to enact them must be met with resistance and a radical, alternative vision - at the dispatch box and in the streets.† '¢ Michael Chessum is national organiser for Another Europe Is Possible† ",0,Neutral
"EU leaders will intervene in Brexit talks in autumn, says German official",0,Neutral,"Britain must give away some sovereignty to secure free trade with the EU but Europe's leaders will intervene in the negotiations in the autumn with the aim of sealing a compromise deal at a summit on 15 October, Germany's ambassador in Brussels has said. Michael Clauss, whose country will take over the rolling presidency of the EU for the second half of the year, said there had been 'no real progress'in the talks so far but predicted they would become the EU's main political focus in September and October. 'Is a deal possible? Yes, definitely. But I think it also means that UK needs to have a more realistic approach,'Clauss said at an event hosted by the European Policy Centre thinktank. 'To put in short, I think you cannot have a full sovereignty and, at the same time, full access to the internal market. So this Brexit issue is going to absorb a lot of political or most of the political attention we expect in September and October.'The signal that the EU's 27 heads of state and government are prepared to turn their focus to the stalling talks will be a boost to Downing Street, where officials have emphasised the need for a resetting of Michel Barnier's negotiating position. The two sides are in a stalemate on access for European fishing fleets to UK waters and whether in return for a zero-tariff trade deal Britain needs to tie itself to the EU's developing state aid rules and common environmental, social and labour standards. British negotiators have voiced fears that the talks have fallen down the EU agenda, with UK officials repeatedly calling for political involvement to break the stalemate. Clauss said that the last few months of 2020 would be 'dominated'by the talks, and Berlin regarded securing a deal as a top priority alongside agreeing on the EU's pandemic recovery fund. A greater cause of concern will be the German ambassador's insistence that a trade deal will require the abandonment of the UK's sovereign right to set its own domestic laws without recourse to Brussels. In contrast, Barnier has repeatedly rejected British claims that the trading away of sovereignty is implicit in the EU's stance on standards and rules on subsidies to business. Clauss, who as Angela Merkel's key representative in Brussels is key figure in communicating Berlin's position on the negotiations to Barnier, said Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, Charles Michel, the president of the European council, and Boris Johnson would meet this month to take stock. 'So far as all of you are aware, no real progress has been made in the negotiation. It's more like both sides, highlighting and stating their positions,'he said. 'As you know, the issues are the future access of the United Kingdom and its companies to the internal market, which are connected to the issue of level playing field: do they have to apply ... state aid, and environmental standards and so on and so on, or not? 'Another issue that is very important for some member states is the issue of fish quotas - in these countries it has a high visibility. This means whether EU member states keep their fish quotas - fish in the UK waters after Brexit has been done - and then another issue of governance. So, what if there is a disagreement on how to read the treaty and what can be done? 'We hope that we will have a deal by the European council [summit of leaders] in October, and confirm,'the ambassador said. 'That means we envisage to be there around the second half of October. We cannot be much later because [the deal] would need to be ratified at least by the European parliament, which needs some time.'Meanwhile Labour has said it will be holding the government's feet to the fire on its Brexit promises insisting it will not let it away with a deal that will wreck the economy further just because of its hard Brexit line. 'That commitment to an 'ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership'is what the country expects†and deserves,'said Rachel Reeves the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.† As Michael Gove's opposite, she is now the key figure in the party, on the Brexit portfolio, previously†held by Keir Starmer. 'We have left the EU, but need a future relationship with our European neighbours that safeguards jobs and businesses, maintains†environmental and employment standards and provides a close security partnership to keep people safe,'she said.† She said this weeks talks were a 'key step†in the government delivering what it promised at the general election in December with the Prime Minister's 'òoven-ready deal''ù.

Single market holds key to unlocking Brexit impasse,0,Neutral,"Nissan says its car plant in Sunderland will be at risk if it has to pay tariffs on vehicles exported from the UK to the EU. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has told banks they need to prepare for the possibility that there will be no deal. It is something of an understatement to say that the talks between London and Brussels are not going well. Whether things are as bad as they look remains to be seen. Threadneedle Street has repeatedly told banks they should prepare for all outcomes, including no deal. It would be a bit rum - and a much bigger story - if Bailey's message was 'don't worry, everything's going to be all right'ù. Trade talks tend to have their own rhythm. The two sides start by taking up positions that are miles apart and in the initial stages of talks insist their demands are non-negotiable. Insults fly about, the talks break down acrimoniously, both sides take it in turns to walk away from the table. Eventually, as the deadline approaches, the mood becomes more constructive. Red lines are crossed; compromises are made; a deal is struck. Will that time-honoured pattern be followed this time? The bad news is that time is running out yet the UK and the EU sides are still dug in to entrenched positions. Both accuse the other of seeking to cherry-pick. Trade deals tend to take years not months to negotiate, yet Covid-19 has meant governments across Europe have had other things on their mind. The mood music is not good. Conversely, the economic devastation caused by the pandemic ought to be motivation enough for a deal. Nissan does not want a 10% tariff slapped on its exports, but the same applies to Germany's automotive sector, which is deeply pessimistic about the future according to the latest survey from the Ifo thinktank. The crunch will come later this month when Boris Johnson meets Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission. One possible way out of the impasse, suggested by Kallum Pickering of Commerzbank, would be for the UK to remain in the single market for goods for an extended period so that an 'ambitious'free-trade agreement can be negotiated, while securing an orderly exit for other sector such as services and finance.† Pickering says both sides could probably sell that as a win. Well, maybe. Both sides will need to make concessions first, though. The three former chancellors who gave evidence to the Treasury committee all had a view about whether the current crisis would be better or worse than the one that almost did for the banks in 2008. Worse, said Alistair Darling, who was actually in charge at the time. Better, said his successor George Osborne, taking hope from the bounce back from previous pandemics. Too early to say, said Philip Hammond, who was at the Treasury this time last year. There is no doubt which of the three wise men is currently most in sync with the mood of the world's equity markets. Share prices have hit their highest levels in three months as investors increasingly take the view that the impact of Covid-19 will be severe but relatively short lived. No piece of bad news seems to shake this optimism. In the past few days, the cold war between Washington and Beijing has intensified, the number of American citizens filing jobless claims has surpassed 40 million, and there have widespread protests across the US over the horrific death of George Floyd, yet stock markets have continued to rise. Bad economic news has continued to roll in, but markets have taken comfort from the fact that mostly it has been less appalling than expected. Sentiment can change quickly, however, and while Darling's view is not fashionable it may come back into vogue. As he pointed out to MPs, he took a lot of stick for pointing out in 2008 that the crisis brewing then was potentially the worst since the Great Depression. But he was right. Is this the beginning of the end for Davos? The World Economic Forum, the body that holds its annual talkfest in the Swiss Alps says next year's event will be part in-person and part virtual. Doubtless the billionaires will still be out in force to discuss the WEF's theme, despite the risk that they might catch something nasty. But here's a prediction: there will be fewer private jets parked at Zurich airport come January. ",-0.25,Negative

UK and EU clash over crime-fighting database in Brexit talks,-0.125,Negative,"EU officials have accused the British government of threatening to weaken security cooperation with the bloc unless the UK gets an equivalent to a major crime-fighting database. The UK is set to lose access to the Schengen Information System (SIS II), a massive EU database, where police across the continent share millions of pieces of information on criminal suspects, at the end of the year. The EU has said it is legally impossible for non-EU countries not respecting free movement of people to access the database and has proposed more basic information sharing. In the latest round of Brexit talks, UK negotiators told their EU counterparts that the offer wasn't good enough. According to EU sources, the UK government threatened to walk away from information sharing if it could not have an equivalent to the SIS II database, which is used by British police every day. 'The UK basically said it was not interested in what the EU suggested and that if they can't have it then they would rather have nothing. So they are playing hardball,'said one EU official. 'We have opened discussions on this,'said a second EU source. 'They were not interested in anything that does not replicate the benefits of SIS II.'A UK government source described the EU account as 'highly misleading'but did not deny rejecting the lesser offer. 'What we are seeking is a future internal security agreement with the EU which provides capabilities similar to those delivered by SIS II, but I'm afraid the EU's alternative proposals on data sharing are nowhere near reminiscent of this and are of limited operational value,'the source said. The Schengen Information System was created in 1995 by countries that had abolished internal border controls. In 2015 Theresa May, who was then the home secretary, took the UK into the database, securing an unprecedented special deal for a country outside the EU passport-free travel zone. During the EU referendum campaign experts warned Brexit imperilled access to the database and would damage the UK's ability to fight terrorism and crime. British police and border guards are the third heaviest users of the database, making 571m searches in 2019 (a figure that includes automated bulk data sweeps) to look for wanted people or stolen goods. UK forces issued 36,680 alerts on people and 259,824 on vehicles in 2019 - essentially a request to other police to carry out checks. The government wants a system with 'capabilities similar to those delivered by SIS II'meaning access to real-time data on tens of thousands of people. The EU offer, it argues, would add nothing to the UK's law enforcement capability. EU negotiators want to maintain police data sharing with the UK, but say their hands are tied because of case law from the European court of justice (ECJ) that limits what can be offered to an outsider. European diplomats also cite political factors such the UK's refusal to countenance a role for the ECJ and opposition to any reference to the European court of human rights (ECHR) in the EU-UK treaty. Both institutions are seen by European governments as providing crucial safeguards over the transfer of data or - in the case of the European arrest warrant - people. 'We wanted of course to have an exchange of data, but it cannot be SIS as such,'an EU diplomat said, citing the absence of guarantees on the ECJ and ECHR. The Brexit clash comes after a prominent MEP accused the UK government of 'behaving like cowboys'earlier this year, after a leaked EU report concluded that British authorities had illegally copied SIS II data. The report fuelled complaints that the UK wants the benefits of EU systems without offering reciprocal aid - a charge strongly rejected by the government. In 2018 the UK responded to 7,000 alerts put on the SIS II system by other countries, while it issued more than 22,500 alerts that led to responses around the EU. ",0,Neutral
Gove proves ultimate shapeshifter while Eustice leads masterclass in banality,0.125,Positive,"As the body count continues to rise and the government's failures become more and more obvious - just imagine how many more people might have died if Matt Hancock hadn't thrown his protective ring around care homes from the very start - you can sense ministers and scientists increasingly socially distancing themselves from any sense of responsibility. Head meet sand. What contact tracing app that was supposed to be the key to ending lockdown? Oh that one! We never meant to imply it was that important. Or that it would necessarily be ready when we said it would. Rather it was just an adjunct to some other measures that we haven't yet thought of. So we are in a game of musical chairs for the morally bankrupt. Which means that Michael Gove is in with a definite chance of winning. Gove is the ultimate shapeshifter. The politician who, more than any other, bends reality to suit his needs. Tonight, Matthew, he will be whoever he wants to be. All failures and shortcomings rewritten as outstanding successes. His two attempts to become party leader? Massive triumphs. Listening to the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster - there is no Brexit secretary any more - answer an urgent question on the third round of Brexit talks that had ended in deadlock you would have had no idea the UK was in the middle of the biggest public health crisis for a century. Or that the economy was contracting by the day and that there were now 10 million people on the furlough scheme, many of whom could be out of a job within months. Rather it was as if the clock had been rewound six months to the Brexit culture wars of late 2019. There wasn't even a nod to the fact that it might be prudent to even consider the idea of extending transition by a short period, just to see what kind of state both the UK and the EU might be in come December. And whether we might cooperate with one another. Rather, we were fighting an ideological war in which everything Brussels did or said was bad and independence day couldn't come soon enough. How dare the EU insist on making the demands it had always said it would make and had been largely agreed in the political declaration of the withdrawal agreement? And how dare Brussels demand we keep a level playing field on standards, hygiene and workers' rights when ours were already far higher than the EU's? Apart from the ones we were were going to lower to get a free trade agreement with the US. Labour's Rachel Reeves did try to talk Mikey down. Though appealing to his reason is never the best tactic, as the Govester isn't strong on rationality. She rightly observed that seven months wasn't long to try to iron out all the remaining details - the cabinet can't even agree among itself whether customs and border checks will be needed between Great Britain and Northern Ireland - and that adding to the uncertainty in such uncertain times was potentially catastrophic. Gove had no answer other than to accuse Labour of having no clear plan and that he was sticking to his own regardless. Get Brexit Done. Which had been rather Reeves's point all along. That not having a clear Brexit plan and hedging your bets over the length of transition was the only sensible option under the circumstances. In the end the Speaker had to interrupt Mikey mid-rant but Gove continued in much the same vein for the rest of the half-hour session. Why were people so obsessed with the coronavirus? It was just an EU plot to thwart Brexit. The people had voted for Brexit and that was what they were going to get. Regardless of how many people had to die or lose their jobs in the process. As if to reinforce the idea that the government was fed up with everyone going on about the coronavirus - what was the big deal about 50,000 deaths and the disappearance from public view of Boris Johnson? - the environment minister, George Eustice, was sent out to take the Downing Street press conference. Because no one is more likely to make people reach for the off button than the most forgettable of cabinet ministers. More so even than ThÈr√®se Coffey, who at least has some unintended comedy value. Earlier in the day she had unwittingly told the BBC that there were plenty of unfilled jobs. I guess she had the Cabinet in mind. Eustice did the prime minister proud by giving a masterclass in banality. He had come with nothing to say and was determined to make sure he said it. So he raced through the same slides that have been shown at every other press conference, before lamenting there were no foreigners to pick soft fruit these days - who would have guessed? - and begging Brits on furlough to support the national effort. It still hasn't dawned on the government that EU workers were quite handy for doing the low-paid work Brits couldn't be bothered to do. Within minutes the minister had put almost his entire audience to sleep. That meant few heard him saying it had been a brilliant idea to stop testing and tracing in March because it made the current levels of testing look all the more impressive. And it had been absolutely right to fill care homes with residents who hadn't been tested because zzzzzzzzz take back control zzzzzzz making our own laws zzzzzzzz and they would have died sooner or later anyway zzzzzzzz. Come the end, I couldn't even be sure if Eustice was still awake. Another day had passed in which no one had taken responsibility for anything. ",0,Neutral
The Guardian view on Covid-19 and migration: a ministerial power grab,0,Neutral,"Why is the government pressing ahead with an immigration policy that was designed for a world that no longer exists? Brexit's strident rhetoric posited falsehoods about migrant workers being behind depressed wages, housing shortages and stressed public services. But that was before coronavirus. Many Britons have woken up now to the fact that vital sectors in the NHS, social care and food production have been kept going by low-paid EU and non-European workers of the kind whose numbers the home secretary, Priti Patel, plans to restrict. Ms Patel's immigration bill claims it is introducing a points-based system, but it is more an income-based one. She proposes to end freedom of movement from the EU and apply the same salary threshold and skills requirement to prospective migrants wherever they come from. The rules are due to take effect in January and it is estimated that two-thirds of EU migrants now classed as key workers would not qualify for a work visa next year. The bill fails because the crisis has shown that salary alone is a poor guide to a person's value to society. The political argument for a tough regime is also fading. The public was warming to immigration before the pandemic struck and there was outrage over the injustice perpetuated on a generation of Caribbean migrants in the Windrush scandal. Polls show widespread public sympathy for low-paid foreign employees in the NHS and care sector. The economic case for revisiting the policy is even stronger. The coming recession is unlikely to make Britain attractive to migrants. Travel is also probably going to remain restricted, limiting the scope to find work. Foreign students, the lifeblood of many universities and the towns that house them, will not rush back to Britain. The disruption to travel is expected to be lasting: Airbus has cut plane production by a third. It's hard to see the sense in continuing with a bill to limit immigration when the shutdown has done that anyway. In an era of high unemployment, jobs that British workers have been able to choose not to do might be more attractive than they previously were. There has been a jump in applications to work in the NHS during the pandemic. The government will need to put more money into training and pay. It is obvious why there are so few local workers in social care when - after a decade of local government austerity - hourly pay in a largely private sector is lower than in supermarkets. Ms Patel ought to be generous and relax the proposed restrictions. She could do so without incurring political cost, as polls show support to exempt lower-paid frontline migrant workers. She did not take the opportunity in the Commons on Monday. This was a mistake. It is also wrong for Ms Patel to force foreign health staff to pay extra to fund the NHS. Large-scale immigration changes rarely work as intended - and one this size delivered in just seven months looks no different. Labour's Nick Thomas-Symonds was right to caution that widening the scope of ministerial sway over immigration amounted to an executive power grab. A blitzkrieg advance by ministers over immigration would be expected after Brexit, which remains the glue that holds Boris Johnson's government together. But the Covid-19 pandemic has made the public understandably fearful. When people are anxious they tend to re-evaluate their beliefs. The shock of the virus has opened the political conversation to ideas beyond Brexit about what sort of society will work for all. For the sake of the country, the government ought to embrace them. ",-0.25,Negative
The looming economic disaster will only get worse if those leading us stick to dogma,-0.75,Negative,"The emerging economic forecasts involve such outlandish numbers that they numb as much as shock. The worst recession for 300 years? A worst-case budget deficit this year of £516bn? The greater shock, of course, is that we are living through a pandemic that has already claimed such a vast number of deaths. All else necessarily pales into insignificance. But those economic numbers will steadily grow in salience - not least because the consequences have to be wrestled with by a government led by second-rate free-market Brexiters. Their ideological mindset - that government and public borrowing are bad, that Britain is an exceptional country for which normal rules do not apply, that robust individualism and free markets are the best default position - is obviously wrong and out of time. Coronavirus is becoming the trigger for a paradigmatic shift in thinking: only thus will Britain be restored not just to medical but to economic and social health. Economically, the new common sense is that Keynes is back. The government is having to spend, borrow, print money and extend its reach in ways unparalleled in peacetime in order to prevent mayhem. But Keynesianism is more than this - it is an entire body of thought about the way a capitalist economy functions. It goes far beyond doing all that it takes to head off a slump. Yes, the state must actively manage the economy, keep it afloat to stop it from capsizing. But the state also has to design and adjust the capitalist craft continually so it is as seaworthy, resilient and high performing as possible. It is the opposite perspective to free-market Brexitism. It is also what the majority of the electorate believe in. Of course, we were readier to accept the constraints of lockdown for the greater good and for our own safety than the Brexiter cabinet ever thought. Of course we clap the NHS and laud essential workers. Of course we want to trust government. And, although it is beyond the Brexiter ken, we are readier to pay taxes for the public good. There is even the first recognition that Britain, for all its past glories, is not now exceptional - that VE Day was 75 years ago and it's time to move on. Britain now needs activist, smart government. The current leadership of the Tory party does not know its own country. For a start there is only one way to get the country moving again in all ways - economic, social and cultural. People must trust that where they work, shop, teach, study, eat and drink is safe. They need surefooted government that seeks active involvement of workers and citizens in decision-making to ensure the right calls are made and are widely owned. Everything from social distancing rules, regular temperature checks, access to testing, and availability of PPE should be discussed and rules co-created. In particular it means taking on board trade union concerns. What was wrong with Johnson's decision to begin a careful exit from lockdown is not the judgment call itself, which on balance is right. It is that it was made disregarding employee involvement; workers cannot be bludgeoned. Witness the concerns of teachers at going to work if they consider there is a risk of death. The government needs to establish best practice on social distancing, sector by sector, and disseminate it. Clear guidance needs to be provided on who should work from home and for how long, how we look after essential workers. It is a degree of micro-management and union involvement that is anathema to libertarian Tories. Worse, as the Treasury warns, Britain soon confronts a potential sovereign debt crisis given the scale of its deficits, made worse, although officials are too politic to acknowledge this truth even in confidential papers, by the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. This in a 2021 world in which the World Trade Organization has ceased to function. How is Britain to trade itself back to solvency in a protectionist globe but outside the EU? There needs to be a pre-emptive response. The government has to start funding its deficit with 'perpetual'bonds, never to be repaid but which carry a higher interest rate, so recognising the abnormality of its plight. It has to signal a readiness to raise taxes as a necessity, even to breaking its manifesto commitments, across the board: the country is in no mood for more austerity. And it has to exclude a no-deal Brexit, signalling a readiness to extend talks if necessary, to get life-giving access to EU markets. Again, all are anathema. The government's emergency loan programmes for business are vital, but many companies are becoming overloaded with debt. Of necessity the debt will have to be converted into shares, in turn converting the government from lender to part owner - in effect creating a kind of sovereign wealth fund. But with what rules of engagement? What are our expectations of companies that would not be alive without government support? A partial answer must be a new and permanently enshrined role for workplace engagement, workers now obviously as much key stakeholders as those who provide capital. Nor can the noxious societal inequalities be allowed to persist, so that the peril of dying in our society is so much higher depending on where you live. In short, our free-market Brexit government has to abandon its beliefs if Britain is to get to the other side in relatively good order. Because it can't - these are mulish men and women resistant to reality - expect an escalating crisis of political authority on top of everything else. The good news is that the ideas and people who have laid this country low are dead men walking. British exceptionalism is finally being laid to rest.

British negotiator gives EU two-week deadline to drop 'ideological' stance,0,Neutral,"Britain's chief negotiator in the talks over the future relationship with the EU has warned Michel Barnier that he must drop his 'ideological approach'within the next fortnight, as the latest round of talks ended in stalemate. The comments from David Frost came as both sides offered a gloomy prognosis for the negotiations on trade, security and fisheries, with little sign of the teams finding common ground. Frost said there had been 'very little progress'in the latest discussions between the two sides, adding that he found it 'hard to understand why the EU insists on an ideological approach which makes it more difficult to reach a mutually beneficial agreement'ù. A UK source described the talks as tetchy at times, with just six weeks to go before a legally binding deadline by which a decision must be made on extending the transition period beyond 2020. The British government has previously said it could be forced to refocus its attention away from the negotiations and towards preparing the country for a no-deal outcome if significant progress has not been made by 1 July. In his statement at the end of the latest round of video-conference negotiations, Frost said: 'We very much need a change in EU approach for the next round beginning on 1 June. 'In order to facilitate those discussions, we intend to make public all the UK draft legal texts during next week so that the EU's member states and interested observers can see our approach in detail. 'The UK will continue to work hard to find an agreement, for as long as there is a constructive process in being, and continues to believe that this is possible.'Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator since July 2016, told reporters in a virtual press conference that the round of talks had been 'very disappointing'ù, adding that he was not optimistic about the outcome. A key flashpoint remains the British insistence that it will not tie itself to common so-called level playing conditions on environmental, social and labour standards. Barnier accused the UK of trying to pick and choose parts of the EU single market, dismissing the government's claims that it is seeking a typical free-trade agreement. 'Every time we meet they say they would be happy to have a Canada-style agreement, but at the same time ... they ask for far more from us than is available under the Canadian model,'Barnier said, citing the UK's desire for 'virtually full freedom of movement'for short visits, maintenance of 'existing arrangements'on electricity interconnection, as well as 'broad and widespread'recognition of professional qualifications to enable British lawyers, accountants and auditors to work in the EU. 'We are not going to bargain away our European values to the benefit of the British economy,'Barnier said. 'Economic and trading fair play is not for sale. It is not 'òa nice to have', it is 'òa must have'.'The former French minister also rejected Michael Gove's recent suggestion, which sources said had been repeated during the latest round of talks, that the UK could accept some tariffs as 'the price'of avoiding European standards. 'Even if we are to get rid of 98%, 99% of tariffs and not 100% that we are proposing '¶ we will require the same strong guarantees of a level playing field.'He also warned that such a detailed and 'very sensitive negotiation'would take years and an extension of the transition period. Despite the downbeat tone, Barnier said the two sides were 'not at the point of failure'and hinted compromise might be possible on the tortuous issue of fishing rights over the 100 species straddling British and EU waters. While the EU wants to maintain the status quo, the UK wants a big increase in its fishing catches from British waters. 'We should be able to move away from these two respective very maximalist positions in order to work on all sorts of parameters between these two maximalist positions,'Barnier said, adding that the discussion was 'perhaps the only positive outcome from this week'ù. But a senior UK source said the level playing field demands were a red line and there could be no 'halfway house'on the issue as it would result in EU laws being 'imposed'on the UK. There is now a working assumption on the UK side that it will take a summit between Boris Johnson and the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in mid-June to break the impasse. In a further sign of the more aggressive approach of the UK under Johnson's premiership, British negotiators also accused the European commission of obstructing progress on services, where they said discussions had been moving faster than in other areas. Barnier denied accusations of such tactics as 'spin'ù, reiterating that the EU wanted all areas of the talks to progress at the same time. 'Parallelism is a condition for progress,'he said. 'It is not a tactic.'The UK Institute of Directors said it was 'worrying to hear how far apart things are, given how little road there is left'ù, with its head of Europe and trade policy, Allie Renison, warning of the 'much bigger consequences for business on both sides of the channel'if talks fail.

UK told to pay EU's costs after being sued over City tax breaks,0,Neutral,"The British government has been ordered to pay the European commission's legal costs after being successfully sued for granting City traders a tax break without EU permission. The European court of justice ruled that the UK breached an EU directive by failing to notify Brussels of a zero rate of VAT given to commodities traders over the last four decades. The UK is now expected by Brussels to seek the authorisation of the 27 member states or drop the policy, which it is claimed has unfairly boosted the City of London at the expense of other EU financial centres. A Treasury spokesperson said: 'We are reviewing the decision of the European court of justice and will provide further details on next steps in due course. 'The decision does not require businesses to pay any VAT on historic transactions, and the law applying to derivatives trades today means no VAT is due. That will remain the case while the UK considers next steps in light of the ruling.'Separately, the EU has launched infringement proceedings against the British government for failing to comply with EU law on the free movement of its citizens and their family members. The government is accused of limiting the rights of first-time jobseekers from other EU countries, as well as putting restrictions on the rights of their family members. The charges, which date back to 2014, also include imposing 'illegal'lifetime re-entry bans on some people. The British government has been given four months to notify the commission that it has fully transposed EU laws on free movement into UK law. There are concerns that the gaps might affect the implementation of citizens' rights under the withdrawal agreement after the end of the Brexit transition period. The UK left the EU on 31 January but under the terms of the withdrawal agreement the country remains under the jurisdiction of the bloc's court in Luxembourg until the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020. Legal cases launched by Brussels will remain live for four years once the transition period is over, and for eight years when concerning citizens' rights. The European court of justice could in theory fine the government even when the UK is long gone from the EU's structures. The twin legal developments will inevitably fuel the arguments of those opposed to an extension of the transition period, during which the UK remains in the single market and the customs union. The row over the tax breaks began in 2018 when the commission claimed that the UK had been gradually extending the scope of VAT zero rates initially given to trades in the future prices of metal, rubber, coffee, sugar, vegetable oil, wool, silver grain, barley and cocoa granted in the late 1970s. The UK government accused the commission of not understanding a 'complex series of restructurings'of the trade in so-called futures and of being overly 'formalistic'ù. The EU's executive disputed that claim, arguing that the extension of zero-rating to a new range of trading was 'not purely formal and were not undertaken simply to take account of the restructuring process'but had allowed 'increasingly complex types of instruments, traded on increasingly complex markets'to escape the tax. It was claimed the VAT zero rate had been extended without due notification to trades on the London potato futures market, the International Petroleum Exchange of London, the London meat futures market, the London platinum and palladium market, the London Securities and Derivatives Exchange Ltd and the London bullion market.

"Brexit will mean checks on goods crossing Irish Sea, government admits",0.75,Positive,"The government has privately conceded there will be post-Brexit checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea, months after Boris Johnson insisted there would be no such trade barriers. In a letter to the executive office in Stormont the government confirmed there would be border control posts in three ports, Belfast, Warrenpoint and Larne. Declan Kearney, one of the two junior ministers in the executive office, the regional equivalent of the Cabinet Office in London, confirmed the details at a select committee session in Belfast on Wednesday. He told members of the local assembly that officials had briefed the executive on Monday. 'The sum total of that, and without breaching executive confidentiality '¶ [is that the] British government has confirmed it will urgently put in place detailed plans with the executive, which does include the physical posts at ports of entry,'said Kearney. The prime minister agreed checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain in a breakthrough meeting in Wirral with his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, last October. However he was then accused of misleading the public after he was recorded on video telling local businesses weeks later that there would be no checks. If any business was asked to fill in extra paperwork, they should telephone the prime minister 'and I will direct them to throw that form in the bin'ù, he told them. The Northern Irish protocol is part of the withdrawal agreement signed in January after Johnson led the Conservative party to an 80-seat majority in December. It will kick in next year whether there is a deal on trade or not. The EU had become increasingly exasperated with Johnson's claims that there would be no checks. Fears that the UK would backslide on the deal were fuelled by the refusal of Johnson's government to allow the EU to open an office in Belfast to help implement and enforce the protocol. The paymaster general, Penny Mordaunt, told the EU such a presence would be 'divisive in political and community terms'ù. The Brexit deal is unpopular across the political spectrum in Northern Ireland because of the extra costs and bureaucracy it will entail for businesses. But it also means checks on the border with the Republic of Ireland will be avoided, something that has the support of Sinn FÈin, and that exporters will have access to both the domestic and EU single market. The South Down Sinn FÈin MP, Chris Hazzard, has said the British government must live up to the commitments made on Brexit, particularly in relation to the Irish protocol. 'The British government cannot be allowed to renege on their legal obligations and must now work with the EU and the executive to ensure those commitments are fulfilled as a matter of urgency,'he said. Business have called for some of the paperwork including the entry and exit declaration forms for imports and exports to be waived, along with health certificates for each product coming to a local supermarket. Analysis by the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium of deliveries from Britain to high-street supermarket chains in Northern Ireland found that firms could incur costs of more than £100,000 per lorry unless special Brexit derogations were agreed. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: 'We have always been clear that there will be requirements for live animals and agri-food, building on what already happens at ports like Larne and Belfast. 'We want to work with NI businesses and the executive to ensure new admin procedures are streamlined and efficient. The protocol puts legal obligations on both sides. We are committed to complying with ours, just as we expect the EU to comply with theirs.'",0,Neutral
"UK-EU trade deal with tariffs impossible in six months, say diplomats",-0.75,Negative,"EU diplomats have dismissed Michael Gove's suggestion that Brussels and the UK could negotiate a trade deal with tariffs on goods in six months, saying it 'will never happen'ù. Giving evidence to the House of Lords EU committee last week, Gove said the government could 'modify our ask'by giving up on a 'zero-tariff, zero-quota'trade deal in order to keep the UK free from a duty to adhere to European standards on workers' rights, environmental protection and state aid. Saying the UK might 'end up like Canada'ù, which signed a trade deal with the EU including some tariffs and quotas on agricultural goods, Gove said: 'We will regret that, we will think that it is a missed opportunity, but if that is the price that we have to pay then there we go.'The two sides are trying to negotiate a deal with zero tariffs and zero quotas (limits on goods), but the UK is resisting EU calls to maintain common standards in exchange for free trade. EU diplomats said Gove's proposal was incompatible with the government's refusal to extend the transition period. 'If we are going to negotiate specific tariff lines, even if it is only a couple of hundred, there is no possibility that we will do this by the end of the year,'said one EU diplomat with experience in trade negotiations. 'That's completely unheard of. It will never happen. But if we are going to go into a line-by-line negotiation, this will take two years.'A second EU diplomat said negotiating even a small number of tariffs could take two or three years. 'You cannot do this in six months' time,'the diplomat said - a reference to the fact that the EU wants talks concluded by October to allow ratification by the end of the year. EU sources say it will be impossible to negotiate tariffs quickly because the 27 member states would need time to agree a common position, balancing competing national interests. 'We will have to define a careful assessment on each tariff line to see where the EU interest is, because it may well be that we will also want to protect industrial products,'a third diplomat said. 'Member states' interests are not the same.'The source said diplomats 'don't really believe'signals from London that 'the UK may be willing to concede tariffs and quotas on specific products, like Canada'ù. The EU insists the UK must be treated differently to Canada because of its proximity and far bigger trading ties. EU countries in northern Europe, who are strong supporters of free trade, would also strongly resist British calls to erect trade barriers in the Channel. It is feared that discussing tariffs would open the door to other trade restrictions. 'Are we doing quotas? Are we going to have specific rules of procedure for different sectors? Are we going to have safeguards in some areas? It's a nightmare,'said one of the diplomats. A UK government spokesperson said: 'Our aim is achieve zero tariffs and zero quotas - that is at least as much in the EU's interest as ours, and the EU has come close to reaching this aim in their other FTAs (free-trade agreements).'British and Brussels negotiators are holding their third round of post-Brexit talks, which are due to conclude on Friday, and EU expectations of a breakthrough are low. Meanwhile, the UK trade secretary, Liz Truss, has outlined the government's negotiating aims for a trade deal with Japan, which it hopes will boost commerce between the two countries by £15.2bn. The UK is scrambling to replace trade agreements in place with dozens of countries through the EU, including one with Japan that came into force in 2019. ",0,Neutral
"Coronavirus shows British-EU solidarity vital, say ambassadors",0,Neutral,"The coronavirus pandemic underlines the need for greater international solidarity, including more cooperation between Britain and the rest of Europe, all 27 European Union ambassadors and high commissioners to the UK have asserted in an unprecedented joint statement. The statement celebrating Europe Day also represents a reassertion of EU unity and the continuing relevance of European values within the UK. The self-confident statement, published in the Guardian, comes as negotiations on the terms of a new trading relationship between Europe and the UK hit difficulties. The talks must be resolved by the end of the year. The EU's trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, warned on Thursday that the UK was preparing to walk away from Brexit trade talks and blame the coronavirus. Europe Day, additional to VE day, marks the moment 70 years ago when Robert Schuman, the foreign minister of France, in a landmark speech laid the foundations for the European Union as a response to the devastation of the second world war that had ended five years earlier. It is the first Europe Day anniversary since the UK left the EU. The 27 ambassadors, along with the new EU ambassador to the UK, Jo√£o Vale de Almeida, seemed determined to argue that the case for international solidarity at the heart of their project has only become more relevant not just in the EU, but also in the UK. The ambassadors wrote: 'For anyone who may have doubted that a close future partnership between the UK and the EU is of mutual interest, the ongoing health emergency has certainly provided ample food for thought. Indeed, in today's globalised, interconnected and interdependent world, cooperation among nations and states - and peoples - is essential.'One ambassador said of the statement: 'This is not about getting British people to change the referendum decision, but just to say we are not ashamed of what we represent, and have much in common with the British people.'The statement said the ambassadors regretted but fully respected the UK's decision to leave the EU, though it also reasserted their belief that European nation states, proud of their individual histories, are 'stronger together'ù. They wrote: 'After progressively enlarging its scope, both politically and geographically, the EU became the biggest single market and the most important provider of development and humanitarian aid in the world, a true global actor committed to effective multilateralism.'Asserting the continuing relevance of Europe Day to Britain, the ambassadors said that 'the UK made a significant contribution to European achievements before and during its 47 years of membership of the EU. 'It is thus only natural for us to celebrate Europe Day also with the British people, its workers and entrepreneurs, its researchers, its teachers and scholars, its artists, its farmers and fishermen, its doctors and nurses. Today, our thoughts go out particularly to the victims of Covid-19 and their families and to all of the dedicated care and frontline workers around the country. 'In our cities, towns and villages, on both sides of the Channel, we have been witnessing an outpouring of dedication, kindness and altruism. It should not come as a surprise: solidarity is indeed part of our DNA, in the European Union as in the United Kingdom. EU nationals employed by the NHS have worked tirelessly, side by side with their British colleagues, to save lives since the outbreak of the pandemic. An EU repatriation programme helped almost 2,000 British citizens stranded around the globe to return home safely'ù. Although the EU stumbled badly at the start of the coronavirus outbreak, resorting to national solutions and rowing over plans for collectivising national debt, the ambassadors insisted that their project is valid. They also insisted that Schuman's dream has gradually come to fruition, 'enabling many countries and millions of Europeans to enjoy freedom, democracy, fundamental rights and high standards of living, in what historians will register as the longest period of peace in our part of the world for many centuries'ù. '¢ This article was amended on 9 May 2020. The original incorrectly stated that Robert Schuman's landmark speech that laid the foundations for the European Union was made 50 years ago. The speech was, in fact, given 70 years ago. ",-0.5,Negative
Will Johnson smuggle a bad Brexit through the coronavirus crisis?,0,Neutral,"When Boris Johnson was a journalist he was a notorious breacher of deadlines. Officials and ministers say he carried that attitude into politics. His career has been fuelled by adrenaline wrung from the last minute of every decision, which means he has probably not yet given much thought to Brexit transitional arrangements. They expire at the end of the year. If an extension is wanted, the deadline for seeking one is 30 June. In trade negotiating time, that is soon. But in coronavirus time it is a faraway horizon. Making the case for a longer transition are trade specialists, economists and diplomats. They understand how hard it is to bridge the gap between London and Brussels in the time available, even without a pandemic. They dread the impact of talks failing amid a Covid-induced slump and can see that the crisis has slowed progress. Veterans of Brexit talks worry about the absence of back channels in the current phase. Screen-to-screen negotiation is no substitute for meeting face to face, but the problem goes beyond the technical hurdles imposed by quarantine. A sensitive grasp of what makes Brussels tick was a disqualification for joining the Johnson administration, which is full of people who observe European motive from afar, through lenses smeared with paranoia and complacency. To the hardline Eurosceptic, transition looks like a remainer trick to bind the UK into continental regulations with no say and money to pay. The case against prolonging that arrangement has three elements. First, deals are easy, and only traitors or cowards deny it. Second, Brexit is a fiery spirit, best downed in a single shot. Sipping is for wimps. Third, the UK gets what it wants by threatening to walk away. The EU will make concessions if Johnson looks wild enough to down the whole Brexit bottle. Those arguments are as wrong now as they were in their 2016-19 heyday, but they still suit the prime minister's temperament. He is convinced that brinksmanship worked last autumn; that the performance of running at the cliff and flapping his arms delivered a better deal than the one Theresa May had proposed. It is true that Johnson's theatrical machismo produced results - but only in the domestic arena. It convinced hardliners that any deal bearing the 'Boris'brand must be sound, which gave political cover for a retreat. The Tory leader withdrew behind a customs border in the Irish Sea, something he had previously rejected and still denies having conceded, although it is a legal fact of his deal. The myth of Johnson as world champion at playing chicken against the EU encourages him to seek a rematch. That confidence is bolstered by the belief that Brexit cliff-edges are not things from which businesses drop, but launch pads from which nations soar. The 'Canada-style'free-trade deal that Johnson is seeking would disrupt the flow of goods, but the cost is meant to be offset by gains in sovereignty. The logistics industry forecasts a need for 50,000 new customs officials to keep the border fluid. That is more than the number of civil servants employed by the whole European commission, but of course those are wicked Brussels bureaucrats who impose foreign red tape, whereas any new financial burden comes wrapped in a marvellous bow of indigenous red, white and blue tape. That Brexit model takes the true believer down a dangerous logical pathway: if a small deal is better than a big one, no deal is the best deal of all. If the goal is separation, why keep a bridge? That was bad economics in 2019, and it has since mutated into something worse. The new strain of no-deal argument going around Tory circles is that any cost from Brexit will be irrelevant compared to the upheaval caused by coronavirus. No one will notice which bit of the hardship was caused by leaving the single market. And reconstruction will be streamlined without the need to deal with Brussels. In short, we know the house will be on fire later this year, so it is better to fan the flames than to save any of our existing stuff, because we want to build a new house and don't like our neighbours anyway. That is not necessarily Johnson's view. He hitched a lift with the radical Brexit cult to carry his ambition. It matched his style combination of English nationalism worn with libertine swagger. It served him well as a campaign vehicle. But as a programme for government, it has limitations. Its methods make the country poorer. That flaw has not done Johnson any harm yet. Experience has taught him that blame for anything Europe-related can be shifted abroad or on to domestic enemies. He will be tempted to try smuggling the economic pain of Brexit inside the bigger pain of Covid-19. But he might also never be as popular as he is now, at the crest of a national crisis. If there is a pragmatic compromise to be made, this is the moment. His subservient MPs would fall into line and not many voters would care, or even notice. Tories who know Johnson well say that his overarching concerns have always been his place in history, and the need for it to be heroic. Last year that meant releasing the UK from the EU. Now it hangs on his handling of the pandemic. The prime minister's Brexit calculations will flow exclusively from whatever he thinks does the least damage to his personal brand and legacy. His crammer's instinct is to ride a deadline and hope for the best. If he suspects that his status as a national champion will be dented by a European accident in December, he will swerve. But Johnson is a reckless, inattentive driver, and the only safe turning point is coming up soon. He could overshoot simply because he has not bothered to read the map or focus on dangers further down the road. '¢ Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist ",-0.625,Negative
The British charlatan style has been sent packing by too much reality,-0.125,Negative,"At the time of writing, we have 27,510 corpses - and rising. GDP is 30% down - and falling. We have lost 950,000 jobs - and there are more to go. We are 37% short of full personal protection equipment for doctors. We are runners-up in the race to have the highest Covid-19 death toll in Europe and may soon leapfrog the Italians and claim the title outright. In short, we are a country that has been put to the test - and seen its leaders fail. As they were bound to fail. From the moment Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Michael Gove won the Brexit referendum in 2016 by promising we could inflict a shuddering change to our country without feeling pain, failure has been inevitable. The only wonder is that it has taken so long for the British charlatan style to die. It's dying now as surely as the lost souls in care homes disappearing out of sight and out of mind. I say British rather than English because Alex Salmond's promises of Scottish independence without tears anticipated Johnson's promises of a painless Brexit and because British dishonesty takes a distinctive form. Since 2016, Johnson has been a postmodern populist. His myths have been cheerful, a world away from the menace behind Trump's snarls. He claimed the impossible was possible with a wink to the camera and a smirk on his face. He believed, or seemed to believe, you could never be sure, that all difficulties could be overcome with a dose of British pluck. Good government in these circumstances would have been next to impossible. Now the pandemic has hit, it is impossible. Everyone involved in the fatal failure to contain the virus in February and early March is covering their backs. You do not, however, need to stare too hard at Johnson's belated statement on 21 March that 'we're taking away the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom to go to the pub'to know that the ideology of the Brexiters is out of time. Johnson did not act until the pandemic had engulfed us because his puffed-up nationalism held that the Brits, so favoured by providence, would refuse to imitate the cowed continentals. We stood alone in 1940. We stood up for ourselves in the Brexit referendum. Why couldn't we stand at the bar now? Behavioural 'science'ù, a dubious discipline, since human behaviour does not follow paths as predictable as Newtonian physics, provided a pseudo-intellectual veneer to cover nationalist self-regard. Ministers and their scientific advisers tarried because they thought freeborn Britons would tire of the lockdown. 'There is a risk if we go too early people will understandably get fatigued and it will be difficult to sustain,'said Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, on 9 March. In fact, the British were locking themselves down days before the government finally accepted the realities of the pandemic. We did so because one aspect of human behaviour remains predictable: we don't want to die. Far from suffering from lockdown fatigue, every survey shows that an alarmed public is not straining to 'get back to normal'ù. Invocations of the wartime spirit, so characteristic of Brexiters who have never fought a war, led to the dallying with the possibility of 'herd immunity'ù. Britain could take the Blitz, so it could take the virus. Meanwhile, the love of simplistic slogans and over-promising so characteristic of the Brexit movement has been displayed to the point of tedium. Yet the practicalities best explain why, in the words of Professor Chris Grey, one of the best chroniclers of our decline, a Brexit movement 'impervious to reason and incapable of engaging with complexity'has reached its terminus. Millions of Britons must have gazed on the cabinet and thought, 'really, Tories, is that your best shot?'They should remember that Johnson destroyed the careers of Alistair Burt, David Gauke, Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve, Philip Hammond, Ed Vaizey and many another Conservatives with ministerial experience because they wouldn't inflict a no-deal Brexit on Britain. He sent others to the backbenches. Jeremy Hunt, for example, was health secretary for six years and you can wonder why he isn't helping out now. Then you remember he challenged Johnson for the Tory leadership and so had to be punished. I am not asking you to like the Conservative politicians Johnson pushed aside, only to accept that the emergency demands the services of ministers who know how government works. Instead, we have a dilettante PM, a cabinet of nobodies and a civil service policed by Vote Leave propagandists, who can fool the country in a referendum but have no idea how to manage it in a crisis. An administration of all the sycophants rather than all the talents. Its time has gone. I am not saying we are about to enter a better age of competent government. Hard times are rarely good times for the centre left and it looks as if we are heading into the hardest of times. Angry people cling to what they have in a slump. They blame foreigners and turn to shop-soiled saviours. Who knows, after populism with a smirk on its face could come populism with the authentic snarl. What's over is the glib, deceitful spirit of 2016 with its false promise that bills need never be paid. The Brexit right has attempted a final rally. It dismissed warnings about public health as 'over the top'just as it dismissed warnings about Brexit as 'Project Fear'and assured us that 'German carmakers'or some other knight on a shining unicorn would make everything all right. But the exhausted Johnson has stopped listening to his old allies. Even he knows that Britain will pay for being one of the last European countries to go into lockdown by being among the last to leave. There are many reasons why yesterday's retailers of counterfeit optimism have become today's frightened pessimists. To be precise, 27,510 reasons - and rising.

British lawyer sues EU over her removal from its court due to Brexit,0,Neutral,"The UK's last judicial member of the European court of justice is suing the council of the European Union and the EU court over her removal from office because of Brexit. Eleanor Sharpston QC, advocate general to the court in Luxembourg, has lodged two claims challenging her replacement by a Greek lawyer before her term in office was scheduled to end next year. Her departure will not necessarily end direct British involvement with the ECJ. A claim has been submitted by a team of London-based lawyers arguing that even though the UK as a nation is leaving the EU, its citizens cannot be deprived of EU citizenship without their consent. Sharpston, whose mandate was due to end in October 2021, has submitted two claims - against the council of the European Union, which represents the remaining 27 EU states, and against the ECJ itself. At the start of the year, Brussels issued a statement saying the mandates of all UK-related members of EU institutions would automatically end on 31 January. Sharpston was the exception to the rule and was told that she would stay on until a successor could take over. A Greek replacement for her has now been found. The number of advocates general, who advise the court's judges, is fixed at 11. A fellow of King's College, Cambridge and a former joint head of chambers in London, Sharpston has been at the ECJ since 2006. Earlier this year, contemplating the possibility of legal action, she told the Law Gazette: 'It may be that the very last service I can render to my court is to see whether there is something I can do to push back against the member states intruding into the court's autonomy and independence.'She is understood to be arguing that she should be be allowed to stay in office until her current six-year term expires and that her removal undermines the judicial independence of the court. Court rules, it is said, ensure that judges and advocate generals can only be removed when they reach the end of their mandate or reach the obligatory retirement age. The ECJ told the Guardian it could not confirm the identity of claimants in the two cases submitted. The court's last British judge, Christopher Vajda, lost his seat in February despite the UK remaining within the single market and customs union until the end of 2020. There are 27 judges sitting on the ECJ - one for every member state. A separate action legal action has been lodged at the ECJ this month by lawyers acting for Prof Joshua Silver, a physicist at Oxford University. The claim is being led by Prof Takis Tridimas of Matrix Chambers and lawyers from the London firm DAC Beachcroft. They argue that while the withdrawal agreement between the UK government and the EU has resulted in the UK as a nation leaving the EU, the fundamental status and rights of the British citizens of the European Union cannot be removed without their consent. Stephen Hocking, a partner at DAC Beachcroft, said: 'In the withdrawal agreement, the EU council purported to remove fundamental individual rights from a group of citizens of the European Union, namely UK nationals, without any due process and without any reference to them. In doing so it acted unlawfully. 'EU citizenship is a citizenship like any other, and it confers individual rights on citizens that cannot be taken away by an agreement between governments.'If he is successful, UK citizens would retain their rights as EU citizens, for example the right to live and work in EU member states. This week Guy Verhofstadt, the former Brexit coordinator for the European parliament, tweeted in support of the legal action: 'People received European citizenship with the treaty of Maastricht. Will be interesting to see, if a government decides to leave, its citizens automatically lose their European citizenship. They shouldn't do!' The case, for which more than £67,000 has already been raised, is being supported by crowdfunding through the website Crowdfunder. ",-0.25,Negative
Fears Brexit talks could collapse in June but UK still optimistic,-1.125,Negative,"The UK is still optimistic about striking a trade deal with the EU but has warned that talks could collapse in June unless Brussels abandons its demands for a common fisheries policy and a level playing field, a source close to the UK's negotiating team has said. The source said only 'limited progress in bridging the gaps between us'had been made at last week's talks, but there was 'confidence that progress can be made quite quickly'ù. The two sides will have to come closer to an agreement before a high-level meeting between ministers planned for June if the UK is to stay at the negotiating table. Boris Johnson is expected to take a more active role in trying to help unblock talks if that date approaches with no breakthrough. The source close to the UK's negotiating team said last week's talks, conducted by video conference, worked well but it was more difficult to build up a personal rapport when communicating remotely. He said he was 'quite positive'about the probability of a trade deal before the end of the year, when the UK's transition period ends, echoing the prediction of Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, that the chances of a deal were 'definitely better than two to one'ù. Responding to those claims about the chances of a Brexit deal, an EU diplomat said the UK was taking a high-stakes gamble. 'Everybody knows that the UK is the world of betting men, but betting alone won't result in a trade agreement. The continent is as engulfed by Covid as the UK, so I wouldn't bank on leaders having much time to cater to British fancy,'the diplomat said. 'Recovery comes first and last, and a trade deal with the UK is of course a necessary element, but not one that needs to be addressed urgently.'A second EU diplomat said: 'If No 10 doesn't change its negotiating approach, we will very likely be looking at a no-deal scenario. So we take this statement [on the positive chances of a deal by Michael Gove] as a welcome sign that the UK will change its negotiating stance and start talking on the basis of the joint political declaration,'the document agreed between the EU and Boris Johnson last October. However, the UK source said: 'What is slowing us up is the EU's insistence on extra provision, notably the level playing field area, aspects of governance and, of course, there is no meeting of minds on fisheries. If they continue to insist on their position on a so-called level playing field, and on continuing the common fisheries policy, for example, we are never going to accept that. 'Draw your own conclusion from that, but I hope they will move on. There are some fundamentals that we are not going to change, we are not going to move on, because not so much that they are negotiation positions as they are what an independent state does.'He added: 'I am confident we will get over that '¶ but probably a bit more noise has to happen before we get to that point.'Johnson has been facing calls to consider asking for an extension to the transition period to avoid the UK having to trade on World Trade Organization terms with the EU from the end of the year. However, No 10 has said an extension is not up for negotiation. The UK source also said it was 'still entirely possible to conclude negotiations on the timetable that has been outlined'ù. EU officials do not share London's optimism. Last week the bloc's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, accused the UK government of running down the clock by 'slow[ing] down discussions on important areas'ù. An EU source said: 'We are really not making any progress,'describing the latest series of talks as 'a standstill round'ù. While this limited progress would be unsurprising in 'normal'trade talks, the accelerated timetable and political attention being consumed by coronavirus has raised questions in Brussels about striking a deal by the end of the year. 'If we had all the time in the world, I really wouldn't be worried about it,'said the source. 'But we are already [almost] into May now. Ratification is going to be extremely complex at the end of the year, so we need more time. We can't plan for the speedy ratification we were hoping for, for many reasons, and everyone is distracted.'Brussels officials also perceive a lack of top-level political engagement in the negotiations. The EU has accused Johnson of backsliding on promises to uphold common standards on the environment, health and workers' rights - the so-called level playing field. Under pressure from coastal member states such as France, Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands, Barnier has also insisted there will be no trade deal without an agreement on fishing rights. Meanwhile in Northern Ireland, the EU-UK specialised committee for the region met for the first time, on Thursday. The DUP MP Ian Paisley accused the group of being 'stuffed with civil servants'and bureaucrats. He said: 'They are not getting the nitty gritty of business needs.'The committee will be critical to the future of Northern Ireland as it has the mandate to work out and recommend what checks should be in place in the Irish Sea when the transition period ends in January. Industry leaders in the region warned that Brexit checks would be imposed on businesses struggling for survival in the Covid crisis, and there was a need for the government to be transparent and straight with them.  Aodh√°n Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said there could be 'no hail Mary pass, no gentleman's agreement'on Brexit checks and the detail needed to be 'nailed down'soon to give businesses any chance to prepare.

A deflated Johnson struggles to muster his usual ebullience,0,Neutral,"Even the Messiah needs to ease himself back to work gently. So rather than hold a press conference where he might be expected to face some tricky questions, Boris Johnson chose to mark his return with a quick statement outside a Downing Street decorated with children's tributes to the NHS shortly after 9am in the morning. Given that it's only two weeks since he came out of intensive care, this was unsurprisingly very much a Boris-lite appearance. Literally so, for he seemed to have lost weight with his suit now being several sizes too large, his face washed out and tired and his hair in urgent need of a trim. Nor were there any of the familiar upbeat enthusiasm and ebullience to his speech. The references to Churchill all fell rather flat and his performance seemed to be geared towards reminding himself as much as the country that he was back in charge. On the upside, even an underpowered Boris is an improvement on Priti Patel or Grant Shapps. He was here because he was here. That seemed to be the main thrust of what he had to say. He was grateful to the NHS, he was grateful to the public for by and large containing their impatience with lockdown - though the internal battle between his own cabinet on the timing of any relaxation in the guidance seems to have encouraged more people to make up their own rules - and we were making progress against the coronavirus mugger. Not exactly the best analogy to use, as the most sensible advice when faced with a bloke with a six-inch knife is to give him whatever he wants. In Boris World, a mugging is just a harmless duffing up by the Bash Street Kids. 'Many will be looking at our apparent success,'Boris continued. At which the only sound to be heard was of jaws hitting the pavement. To be fair, even he looked a bit embarrassed at that line. So far, the UK has recorded more than 20,000 coronavirus deaths in hospital and possibly as many as that again at home and in care homes. Which would already be roughly the number of civilians who died during the Blitz in the second world war, with the prospect of many thousands still to follow. If that's a success, I'd hate to see what failure looked like. Or perhaps, the prime minister regards it as a matter of honour to top the European mortality figures. Either way, most other countries will be looking at the UK as an object lesson in how not to handle a pandemic. What followed was, in its way, just as startling. In claiming to have protected the NHS by flattening the levels of infection, he completely forgot to mention his government's own negligence in failing to provide adequate supplies of personal protective equipment for NHS staff and care home workers. Nor did he offer any explanation or apology for his failure to take the coronavirus seriously right from the start of the pandemic, a decision that may have cost many thousands of lives. Nor was there any recognition that other countries that had implemented a rigorous 'test, track and trace'policy had achieved far more success in containing the coronavirus. Or that his 250,000 daily testing target had always been bollocks. As so often, it was the subtext of what Johnson didn't say that provided by far the more informative meta narrative. By now, Boris was beginning to develop a hunted look in his eyes. His own brush with death has provided him with just a hint of conscience previously absent throughout his political career. The eyes are a window into a very troubled soul. He can sense the stench of battery chickens staying at home to roost. He talked of transparency when his government has done everything it could to keep Dominic Cummings's role in the Sage meetings secret. He talked of bringing in opposition parties, though none would do so without first making clear that they would never have started from the current position. He talked of reaching the second phase without saying how many phases he expected there to be. Mainly because he just doesn't know. Three? Four? Five? He's flying blind. Just wittering on about enthusiasm and determination no longer cuts it. The situation has outgrown Boris's capacity for being serious. He knows he faces some tough choices in the next few weeks. A cabinet battle between the hawks who reckon tens of thousands more old people dying is a price worth paying to kick-start the economy and the doves who put the nation's health as its first priority is looming. With him stuck somewhere in the middle. And Boris has never been in politics to make enemies. He's Mr Fun Guy. All the tough decisions he has made have only ever been taken by accident. By default: the law of unintended consequences. Now he really is going to have to take the tough calls that will define his legacy. The honeymoon period of his resurrection will be over in a matter of days. Then comes judgment day. Whatever he does, he risks losing the confidence of half the cabinet and half the country. And the tricky calls will keep on coming. Over at the Brexit committee, Michael Gove had clearly taken far too many psychedelics, as he imagined the coronavirus could make a UK-EU deal far more likely. Hilary Benn, the committee chair, just looked bewildered. How can you possibly reach an outline of an agreement in two months, when no one has a clue what the global economy will be like in a year's time? Nor can you blame a botched Brexit deal on the coronavirus without first spelling out your negotiating objectives. Something the government has so far refused to do.

Boris Johnson's lockdown is the latest target for the right's angry culture warriors,-0.125,Negative,"For weeks we have heard that merely asking questions about the government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak is 'politicising the crisis'ù. But now some people on the right are indeed making the pandemic political - firing up the culture wars forged in what now feels like the prehistoric age of Brexit. Luminaries of the leave campaign have jacked up familiar themes to revive a well-worn narrative: of patriotic ordinary people set against 'whingeocrat'metropolitan elites and woke leftists who hate Britain. In the coronavirus edition of the culture wars, critics of the government's slow, muddled response to the pandemic - who may overlap with the remainers of old - are cast as gleeful about Britain's horrifying death toll, since it presents an opportunity to bash both the Conservatives and the conceits of exceptionalism. Complaints that coverage of Boris Johnson's own illness overshadowed a nightmarish week of deaths and national suffering are scorned for failing to understand the public's love for the prime minister. And damning revelations about the government's lack of preparedness for when the pandemic struck are breezily dismissed. People will forgive Johnson anything, his cheerleaders insist, while critics - 'remainer losers'- are foolishly obsessed with his misdemeanours. But the key issue in the right's current culture war is the lockdown, which is being presented as a freedom-sucking con - much like the EU. Mirroring the dynamics of climate denialism, those challenging the overwhelming consensus of global expertise cast themselves as lockdown 'sceptics'ù. And cleaving to a rightwing populist script, these sceptics say their legitimate concerns are being silenced. Writing in the Spectator, Lionel Shriver notes that no TV platform is offered to those outside the 89% who support the lockdown. The sceptics claim to be speaking truth to the overly frightened masses, explaining that a costly lockdown is more deadly in the long term and urging that we reassess priorities. As Toby Young put it: 'Spending £350bn to prolong the lives of a few hundred thousand mostly elderly people is an irresponsible use of taxpayers' money.'Failing the most basic moral test of any society worthy of the description, lockdown sceptics say that a recession may be more deadly than the pandemic, an idea already dismissed as nonsense. Strikingly, these sceptics don't engage with the actual issue with the lockdown: that it came too late, causing thousands of unnecessary deaths, even while many scientists and the World Health Organization were imploring swifter action of the like being taken by other countries. Swerving this debate, the culture-war narrative is, as ever, a rhetorical smokescreen, deflecting substantive arguments. And just as Brexit was a delivery mechanism for hard-right ideas, lockdown scepticism is about promoting an ideological agenda. Tellingly, the Critic, a rightwing magazine, views the divide as 'the ever-lockers vs the liberators'ù. But who even wants to stay in lockdown? Most would prefer release to come as soon as possible. Scientists signal that a test-and-trace strategy is the best way out, yet you don't hear lockdown sceptics protest that the paucity of Covid-19 testing is obstructing their fundamental freedoms. What's really being contested is the kind of society that will emerge once this is over. And you can see why Brexit populists and big-state haters are worried. When Rishi Sunak unveiled an unprecedented economic bailout last month, one rightwing commentator told me it was infuriating: if the government could so easily pump money into society, how would the right ever again argue against state funding? And while the realities of lockdown vary considerably according to factors such as wealth, class, gender and race, some elements of it have been experienced as positive. Recent polling suggests only 9% of the population wants a post-lockdown return to how things were before: we're enjoying the cleaner air, sightings of wildlife, stronger community and increased time to connect with some friends and family. Already in Italy, Milan is attempting to emerge from lockdown into a city with less pollution by announcing an ambitious scheme to reduce the number of cars on its roads. According to one of the city's deputy mayors: 'Of course we want to reopen the economy, but we think we should do it on a different basis from before. We think we have to reimagine Milan in the new situation.'Lockdown sceptics commonly reject the green policies proposed by climate campaigners, but the recent closures have unleashed an appetite for them. Despite speculation over the influence of sceptics within government, the prime minister is reportedly cautious over rushing to loosen the current isolation measures. But the hallmarks of lockdown scepticism can be seen in the government's go-it-alone rejection of the EU's bulk-buying scheme for essential equipment, and in its initial pursuit of 'herd immunity'ù. Their power in the press and in the heart of government signals the battles we will face over the shape of our future society - and shows how existing divisions may be manipulated for political advantage. The sceptics are currently out of sync with public opinion. But as we know from painful experience, we can't assume this will always be the case. Rachel Shabi is a journalist and author ",0,Neutral
No-prorogation justice Lady Hale to publish memoir and guide to the law,0.25,Positive,"Lady Hale, who presided over the momentous decision to rule Boris Johnson's prorogation of parliament unlawful, is set to write her memoirs, of how 'a little girl from a little school in a little village in North Yorkshire became the most senior judge in the United Kingdom'ù. The supreme court's first female president, who retired this year after capturing public attention with her steely handling of the prorogation case and her eye-catching array of brooches, has signed a deal with Penguin Random House imprint the Bodley Head for two books: a memoir, which will be published next year, and an exploration of the importance of the law, from why we need it to why it sometimes fails, illustrated using landmark judgments. Hale said of the memoir, to published in 2021: 'Mine is not a rags to riches story - either at the beginning or at the end.'Instead, she said, it was the story of how that little girl from North Yorkshire 'found that she could cope. And it shows how other women and people from similarly small beginnings, without any connections or obvious advantages in the law, will find that they can cope too.'She said her second book would explore how the law was 'there for government '¶ no one at all is above the law'ù. She added that it would explain how the law 'touches all our lives - every time we buy something, take a ride on a train or a bus, go out for a drive or to ride our bikes, go to school or to work, start a business, move in with a partner, get married or have children, go to hospital and eventually die - the law is with us from cradle to grave'ù. 'It should be there for everyone - and not just for individuals and enterprises,'she said. 'We all need to know where we stand and never more so than in extraordinary times like these.'Stuart Williams, who acquired the two books for the Bodley Head, said Brenda Hale had been 'an inspirational figure to many people for years - for her achievements in the law, for the causes she has championed, and for her passionate views on access to the law as a profession'ù. 'Of course, her historic and dramatic role in determining that parliament had not been prorogued gave her an even greater national prominence,'said Williams. 'I expect her books to be direct, warm, arresting and candid, and to introduce readers to a great mind and a great campaigner.'Equal to Everything, a children's book about her life, written by the Guardian columnist and former barrister Afua Hirsch, was published last year.

What the EU procurement furore tells us about Johnson's real priorities,0,Neutral,"On one level, the argument about what Sir Simon McDonald said to the foreign affairs select committee this week can be dismissed as a storm in a Whitehall teacup. Hours after the head of the foreign office had called Britain's refusal to join the European Union's procurement efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic a 'political decision'ù, McDonald retracted his words. Whitehall-watchers are fascinated. The wider world has bigger things to worry about. But on another level, this week's row is political dynamite - and for two main reasons. First, and more immediately, the McDonald affair is another challenge, this time from the Whitehall high command itself, to the government's increasingly desperate attempts to show that ministers have successfully gripped the effort to secure life-saving medical equipment and protective kit for the fight against the virus. At its most serious, it comes down to an admission that ministers who previously said that the UK did not take part in the ventilator procurement programme because of 'communication'errors were actually in a position, early on in the pandemic, to save more lives by joining the scheme, and yet deliberately chose not to. Second, Tuesday's furore shoots a beam of light into the dark and tangled argument at the heart of British politics about the longer term strategy and objectives of Boris Johnson's government. It is a reminder that, in this government, power still rests with those who believe the overriding objective of this administration, even now, is a hard Brexit. It implies that in Johnson's government the fight against Covid-19 is, of course, massively important - but only up to a point. McDonald's session with the foreign affairs committee was not, at the outset, about participation in the EU procurement programme at all. Most of the first hour was about efforts to repatriate UK nationals from around the globe. But when, later on, the committee chair, Tom Tugendhat, asked whether Britain's failure to take part in the EU programme was a political decision, the head of the foreign office confirmed that it was. The hasty retraction letter on Tuesday evening was extraordinary. If nothing else, it confirms the incredible sensitivities in government at the moment about its handling of the pandemic. The letter also needs to be read carefully. The key sentence nevertheless appears to be this one: 'Ministers were not briefed by our mission in Brussels about the scheme and a political decision was not taken on whether or not to participate.'The more you read the letter, the more questions it raises. The key point is that, in early February, while the UK's Brussels mission did not brief ministers - the denial in the letter - about the EU scheme, the Brussels mission clearly did brief departmental civil servants. In practice, that means that Brussels briefed the Foreign Office and the Department of Health and Social Care about the ventilator procurement scheme, presumably at a senior level, in detail and as an issue requiring priority attention. Those civil servants will then have briefed their ministers, including the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and the health secretary, Matt Hancock. So ministers were indeed briefed, only not by 'our mission in Brussels'ù. In other words, the ministers knew about the scheme and knew they could take part in it. What exactly happened next depends in part on what is meant by a 'political decision'ù. That phrase has now been denied. But it is hard to take the retraction too seriously, other than as a means of removing ministerial fingerprints. It can mean what many people would assume, that the decision was political rather than practical or commercial. But in civil service-speak, a political decision can also mean a decision taken by ministers, who are political, rather than officials or expert specialists, who advise them about it. In this context, that would most probably mean the decision, even in the shape of a 'non-decision'to let the issue lie on the table, was taken by or on behalf of Boris Johnson in No 10, but it would be essentially political in both senses. That seems to fit with other evidence suggesting that the question was indeed discussed at Cobra meetings, which always report to the prime minister. It would also be valuable to clarify how and in what terms that initial decision in London was then communicated in a response to the EU in Brussels. If London chose to write itself out of the EU process in February, that may help explain why the UK claims not to have been informed about other joint schemes later. Even without the full details, there is no way of reading these events as anything except another, and early, example of the government's failure to take Covid-19 seriously enough soon enough. More than two months later, in Raab's words in the Commons today, it is now the government's official policy to take 'the right measures at the right time, guided by the science and the medical experts'ù. But this was not true in February, when the science and the experts were ignored at Cobra. Instead, the decision not to join the EU efforts has contributed to the shortages and failings on which Keir Starmer began his parliamentary career as Labour leader today. But the importance of the decision goes further, and in a direction that Starmer chose not to follow, perhaps wisely on his debut. The political decision not to join the EU procurement process reflected what was uppermost in Johnson's and other minds in February. Britain, as McDonald stressed this week, had left the EU on 31 January. The Brexiters had done what they promised at the election. The national ship was being set on a course that turned its back on Europe. They weren't interested in new post-Brexit links with EU schemes any more than they were interested in establishing such links during the transition period. Any suggestion, at this of all moments, that the UK should opt into an EU scheme on anything will have been dismissed with contempt. It was in every way a political decision. A month or so later, things - including politics - were different. When Hancock was offered a renewed chance to join another EU-wide scheme, the offer was taken up. But by then Covid-19 was a far larger reality, the UK was facing lockdown, and ministers were playing catch-up, just as they still are today. McDonald's retraction on Tuesday shows that, even in the face of Covid-19, not as much has changed as some might assume. The retraction is not just a partisan correction of the record. It is a statement that the Johnson government will maintain its ideological opposition to anything except a hard Brexit. Those who say, as David Lidington did this week, that a Brexit extension is now inevitable because of Covid-19, may be deceiving themselves. In this government, especially as it struggles to control the coronavirus outbreak in the face of shortages and deaths, the pandemic remains an all-consuming but still essentially temporary concern. Johnson's essential project is not to save and rebuild the nation. It is Brexit. Always was. Still is. '¢ Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist ",-0.5,Negative
Let's get serious: we need to extend the transition period with the EU,0.25,Positive,"Covid-19 has changed how we interact as a society. But it is harder to know what the repercussions will be for international trade. The prospectus for Brexit was based, in part, on the trading opportunities waiting to be seized by 'global Britain'ù. How does Covid-19 change the balance of risks and opportunities that face us? The impact of the pandemic on international trade is likely to outlive the health crisis. According to the World Trade Organization, world trade may fall by 32% this year. To put this into context, trade fell 40% in the first three years of the 1930s Great Depression. This time, the fall in trade is self-induced, to save lives. But the contagiousness of Covid-19 exposes vulnerabilities in the trading system. Economies, like societies, are complex networks of direct and indirect relationships. We may be fairly confident in the health of our immediate trading partners, but as important is the health of the partners they trade with. Covid-19 causes deep problems. Supply chains locate production across the world to maximise efficiency. Unsurprisingly, the WTO expects trade to fall more in sectors with complex value chains. Equally, the movement of people is fundamental to how we trade services. We have to set up a shop, attract students or locate management. Eight out of 10 UK jobs are in the services sector. Services account for about half our total trade. Yet travel restrictions now apply in 150 countries. They are likely to be lifted slowly, as some nations control the pandemic more quickly than others. Early signs are not encouraging. JP Morgan's global purchasing managers index shows the fall in services export orders much greater than for manufactured goods. Our ability to specialise creates the gains from trade, but it has also created a vulnerability. The WTO rules permit temporary export prohibitions to relieve critical shortages. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic 40 nations have introduced export restrictions on medical equipment. Trade specialist Simon Evenett calls these sicken-thy-neighbour policies. What will this do for trust and reciprocation after the heath crisis has passed? The impact of the pandemic on global trade, in other words, might well be longer term. Beata Javorcik, the chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, has pointed out that resilience will in future be a key concern for businesses, which might imply some degree of reshoring and potentially moving away from holding near-zero inventories so as to hedge against the possibility of future disruptions to supply chains. The chief executive of Bosch has expressed concern about the future of the company's supply chain. In times of economic hardship, the temptation to turn inwards and play the nationalism card has proved too tempting. Which brings us to Brexit. The transition period agreed in the EU withdrawal agreement and passed by parliament in January provides for frictionless access to the European market and its trading partners until 31 December. This is why leaving the EU has changed relatively little on the ground. The government has until 30 June to decide whether to request and pass legislation allowing an extension of the transition period by one or two years, or leave the single market and customs union by year end, with or without a trade deal. Some argue that the pandemic strengthens the case to end transition, to free us to sign new free trade agreements around the world in order to revive our recuperating economy. This requires us to rediscover our competitive spirit and reach a mutually favourable agreement with the US and the other nations that will follow. However, these arguments are unpersuasive. Essentially, they amount to sacrificing our existing trading relationship with the EU, accounting for about half our total trade, for hypothetical and problematic future deals with the US and others in very short order. Given the uncertainty about the future of world trade, this would be a risky moment to make trade with by far our biggest trading partner more difficult, while pinning our hopes on being able to increase trade with the rest of the world. The disruption caused by the pandemic makes it unlikely that a comprehensive free trade agreement between the UK and EU can be secured before the transition period ends. Surely, under such circumstances, it makes sense to take advantage of the opportunity to extend afforded us by the withdrawal agreement? This certainly seems to be the view of the British public: twice as many think the prime minister should amend his 31 December deadline than do not. Of course, there is a political rationale for the government to fulfil its promise to deliver the end of transition on time. Yet, given what the pandemic has done - and may yet do - to the global economy, there's an equally strong, if not stronger, practical one for reconsidering.

Scheme for EU citizens to stay in UK draws 3.4m applications,0.125,Positive,"The Home Office has received 3.4m applications from people seeking to stay in the UK after Brexit under the EU settled status scheme. It puts the government close to its overall goal for the scheme, with estimates of the number of EU, EEA and Swiss citizens eligible to remain in the country lying between 3.4 million and 3.8 million. However, monthly data, which was published on Thursday, shows there is still a backlog of 320,000 applications and researchers at Oxford University have warned that many citizens may 'fall through the cracks'ù. EU citizens in children's homes, care homes or those who are victims of domestic abuse, where others may not be aware or allow them to apply, have been cited previously as among those at risk. Detailed breakdown provided by the Home Office shows there were 125,000 applications to the scheme in March. This brought the overall number of applications received up to 31 March to 3,468,700, including approximately 180,000 non-EU nationals who are family members. The total number of applications concluded was 3,147,000. Of those 58% were granted settled status and 41% granted pre-settled status. Of the remaining applications 10,000 were invalid and 600 were refused, 98% of which were on eligibility grounds and 2% on 'suitability grounds'ù, said the Home Office. The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said in a report, Not Settled Yet, published on Thursday, that there was no way of verifying whether the government was reaching its goal because there was no official means of doing so, as no registration system existed before for migrants. Madeleine Sumption, the director of the research unit, warned that the government could relax thinking it had captured data for all of those eligible to remain in the UK when many may not apply at all. 'The government has invested a lot of effort in making the EU settlement scheme easy to use,'she said, 'but with any scheme of this size it is inevitable that some people will fall through the cracks. It will be very hard to know to what extent this has happened, without a parallel investment in new data. 'For a host of reasons, it's possible that the number of EU citizens granted status through the scheme could greatly exceed the current official estimate of 3.4 million but that wouldn't necessarily mean the task is finished.'The campaign group the3million said it had concerns that some of the more complex cases were now taking up to six months to resolve, creating anxiety for many families whose lives were put on hold. It also expressed concern over the lack of information about refusals. 'We have gone from 'ònobody is being refused status on eligibility grounds' to hundreds of refusals per month, without knowing why cases are being refused,'said Maike Bohn, one of the group's co-founders. 'The real question is how many people have not applied, and the government simply doesn't know it. Every single EU resident to miss the deadline of 30 June 2021, for whatever reason, will automatically lose their legal status in the UK. It is crucial we know how many, who, and where they are - but we have no data that would allow us to establish this.'The data puts Polish citizens at the top, with 665,000 applicants, but it has been estimated previously there are about a million Poles in the country. Some returned home after Brexit. Romanians are the second highest number of applicants by nationality, at 564,300, followed by Italians at 351,600 and Portuguese at 273,000. The Home Office said there was still more than a year left until the deadline and if someone had reasonable grounds for missing the deadline, they would be given a further opportunity to apply. It also pointed out that the scheme would open beyond 30 June 2021 'not just for those with reasonable grounds for applying late, but also to accommodate those granted pre-settled status, who will be able in due course to apply for settled status, and close family members living overseas at the end of the transition period (and children born after that date) who later join a resident EEA or Swiss citizen here with status under the scheme'ù.

EU and UK government to resume post-Brexit talks next week,-0.125,Negative,"The European Union and UK government have agreed to resume post-Brexit talks next week, where they will confront entrenched divisions on trade and fishing rights over video link. The two sides released a timetable for the next three rounds of negotiations in an attempt to get coronavirus-disrupted talks back on track, following a video conference on Wednesday between the prime minister's chief negotiator, David Frost, and his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier. Following Brexit day on 31 January, the EU and UK managed only one round of talks before coronavirus crashed them. There were two cancelled sessions and the lead players were put into isolation. Barnier came down with coronavirus in March and has recovered. Frost, who had 'mild symptoms'of the virus, is no longer self-isolating. While the two leads were confined to their homes, the EU and UK continued working on draft legal texts, but progress ground to a halt. In a joint statement, the two sides said recent technical work had been 'useful to identify all major areas of divergence and convergence'ù, but they agreed there was a need to organise further talks 'in order to make real, tangible progress in the negotiations by June'ù. Very happy to talk to @michelbarnier today and agree a refreshed timetable for UK / EU negotiations by videoconference - starting next week.

We need real, tangible progress in the negotiations by June. We must advance across all areas.https://t.co/FGN5ko7JcH pic.twitter.com/zXBMpF1L6c The next round will begin next week, with further talks scheduled for the weeks of 11 May and 1 June. Agendas for the negotiating sessions have not yet been published, but are expected to cover the 11 key topics of post-Brexit talks, including trade, security policy and fisheries. During the video call, Frost told Barnier the UK did not intend to seek an extension to the 11-month transition period, which ends on 31 December 2020. Yet EU diplomats are increasingly convinced that London will ask for an extension, as the fallout from coronavirus hammers the global economy and consumes political energy across Europe. Any decision to extend the transition must be agreed by both sides by 1 July and would require a deal on new payments into the EU budget. The transition period - which keeps the UK in the EU single market and customs union without voting rights - can be prolonged for up to two years, but only once. As the clock ticks down, EU diplomats are dismayed the UK has failed to produce a draft legal text on fisheries, despite a goal to agree on fishing rights covering 100 shared species by 1 July. The absence of a UK text is perceived as an attempt by the British to gain the upper hand by attempting to delay difficult issues until the last minute. EU sources insist there will be no agreement on anything without a deal on fish. The two sides have not narrowed their differences on any of the major sticking points, such as agreement on common environmental, social and competition law standards for free trade, or the role of the European court of justice. Last Friday the UK handed two legal texts to the EU, covering energy and law enforcement, adding to previous documents sent to Brussels, which cover trade, air safety, air transport and civil nuclear. The British have irritated EU diplomats by denying Barnier permission to share these texts with national capitals. That means the 27 EU member states, who will make the ultimate decision on the terms of the future relationship, are relying on analysis and summaries from Barnier and his negotiating team, rather than the original documents. The commission has published its 440-page draft legal text online, reflecting its longstanding Brexit transparency policy - and the reality that documents rarely remain secret for long in Brussels.

UK government in row with EU over proposed office in Belfast,0,Neutral,"The British government has rejected an EU request to open an office in Belfast, in the first major row over the implementation of the post-Brexit Irish border protocol. The EU closed its offices across the UK when the country left the bloc on 31 January, but its officials have a right to be present to monitor the checks and controls on goods crossing the Irish Sea. The Foreign Office has rejected Brussels' request for a permanent physical presence in Belfast on the grounds this would go beyond what is stipulated in the withdrawal agreement. There are concerns it would be seen by some as a step towards joint policing of the customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The British government fought during negotiations over the withdrawal agreement to ensure that checks and controls on goods crossing the Irish Sea would not be jointly carried out. The row highlights the potential for the protocol on Northern Ireland to be a cause of contention between the EU and UK in the months to come. Under the withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland effectively stays in the single market. It also remains within the UK's customs territory to allow it to benefit from any future trade deals secured by the British government. But the full EU customs code has to be enforced on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. All goods deemed at risk of travelling from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland would attract tariffs. The messy compromise allowed for the avoidance of a border on the island of Ireland but brings with it a host of potential flash points. The issue of a Belfast office was raised on Monday during the first teleconference meeting of the EU-UK joint committee, set up to supervise the operation of the withdrawal agreement. The chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, is the UK's senior figure on the committee. Under article 12 of the Northern Ireland protocol, the UK government is 'responsible for implementing and applying the provisions of [EU] law'but EU officials 'shall have the right to be present during any activities'relating to checks and controls. The UK is obliged to 'facilitate such presence of representatives and shall provide them with the information requested'ù. The EU wants a base for its customs and veterinary experts. A European commission spokesman said: 'We can confirm that we have sent letters to the UK regarding a proposal to open a technical office in Belfast with specific technical capabilities to ensure the implementation of the protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland. This issue was raised in the joint committee on Monday. We remain in contact with the UK on this point.'A cross-party group of members of the Northern Ireland assembly has written to the prime minister backing the commission's proposal. Michelle O'Neill of Sinn FÈin, who is the deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, along with the leaders of the Greens, the Social Democratic and Labour party and the Northern Ireland Alliance, wrote: 'As party leaders representing a majority of citizens who voted to remain within the EU, we feel strongly that an office in Belfast is necessary to ensure the implementation of the protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland which you negotiated with the EU '¶ 'To oppose the opening of such an office by the EU in Belfast represents an act of bad faith by your government and a breach of trust at this critical stage of the process.' A spokesman for the UK government said it was considering the issue. He said: 'We received an initial request from the EU and responded to decline the proposal in February. We have since received a follow-up letter to which we will respond in due course.'",-0.125,Negative
"Extend Brexit transition by years over coronavirus, UK told",0,Neutral,"The largest group in the European parliament has urged the UK government to do the 'responsible thing'and extend the Brexit transition period, as coronavirus plays havoc with the timetable for an EU-UK deal. The centre-right European People's party (EPP), which unites the parties of 11 EU leaders, including Angela Merkel and Leo Varadkar, issued a statement on Monday calling on the government to extend the Brexit transition beyond the end of the year. Christophe Hansen, a MEP from Luxembourg who sits on the European parliament's international trade committee, said: 'Under these extraordinary circumstances, I cannot see how the UK government would choose to expose itself to the double whammy of the coronavirus and the exit from the EU single market, which will inevitably add to the disruption, deal or no deal. 'I can only hope that common sense and substance will prevail over ideology. An extension of the transition period is the only responsible thing to do.'David McAllister, the German MEP who leads the European parliament's work on the future relationship with the UK, said the pandemic complicated an 'already very ambitious'schedule. 'The ball is now clearly in the British court,'he added. Under the withdrawal agreement, the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December 2020, terminating British membership of the EU single market and customs union. But it can be extended for one or two years if both sides agree by 1 July. The EU has made little secret it would back any extension request, but the British government continues to rule that out. Responding to the EPP statement, a UK government spokesperson said: 'The transition period ends on 31 December 2020, as enshrined in UK law, which the prime minister has made clear he has no intention of changing.'The plea for extra time comes as British and EU politicians prepared to hold their first meeting to discuss putting in place the Irish Sea border.

The pair were also due to discuss citizens' rights, amid concern from campaigners that the coronavirus crisis would make it harder for European Union nationals in the UK to secure their status.

However, the EU struck a more insistent tone, saying there was an 'urgent need'for a timetable on putting into place customs procedures and animal health checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. EU officials have been alarmed by repeated statements from the prime minister that there will not be controls on goods crossing this internal UK border - a statement that contradicts what he agreed in the withdrawal agreement. The British government stated it was committed 'to upholding our obligations under the Northern Ireland protocol'ù. The latest talks were not intended to touch on the future relationship, amid rising doubts about the prospects for agreeing an unprecedented deal spanning trade, security and fishing rights by the end of the year. British and EU negotiators had concluded only three and a half days of formal talks before the coronavirus struck Europe heavily. A second round due to be held in London earlier this month was scrapped, while next week's talks seem unlikely to go ahead, despite previous hopes of running them by video conference. British officials say they continue to explore video-conferencing. But it's not a simple fix. At least 10 to 20 people can take part in just one thematic topic for each side, making virtual talks complicated to organise when individuals are working from home. Talks may cover about 10 different themes. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has the virus, while his UK opposite number, David Frost, has symptoms and has gone into self-isolation. Officials on both sides say they are in regular contact. ",0.75,Positive
We simply don't know what kind of Britain will awake from all this,0,Neutral,"If there is one thing everyone living through the Covid-19 emergency agrees, it is that it is unprecedented. Everyone is surely right about that. But what follows in politics, economics and social behaviour from that recognition? There is no agreement there. There are resemblances with wartime, of course, but Britain never went into almost total lockdown in wartime. There are echoes of past pestilences too, but these afflictions did not bring normal life to such a totalising standstill. And these are only early days in a long process. Politicians are no better than anyone else at adjusting to radical change. As Boris Johnson's uncertain initial messaging exemplified, adjustment takes time. The worst of the crisis is also yet to come. Covid-19 cases and deaths have not yet peaked. The outbreak may drag on for longer than we have yet grasped, or it may return. Pretending that life could be back to normal by Easter, as Donald Trump does, is delinquent. If the 1918-19 flu pandemic is a guide, the Covid-19 virus may be with us for a year. This length and seriousness mean that none of us yet knows what the final accounting on the Covid-19 crisis will look like. But we can say that we are likely to be living with some of the pandemic's consequences for years to come. The issues that could endure are many. They start with the shared experience of having the shadow of death hanging over our heads. They include, additionally, the impact of the massive public health emergency itself, the many transformations of everyday living, the state's mobilisation to defend the economy, and the general anxiety about the future that is laid bare in an Ipsos-Mori survey this week. None of these is likely to be gone by Christmas, never mind by Easter.  Faced with an extraordinary event, it is natural to think it will have extraordinary long-term consequences too. Nevertheless, much of the speculation about this is struggling to adjust. Its feet are still firmly planted in the past. It is largely conditioned by earlier political divisions such as Brexit. In some cases, the pandemic is merely vindicating whatever the thinker believed in the first place, before the outbreak began. All the pandemic has done is make them believe it more strongly than ever. There are three obvious problems with such an approach. The first is it assumes the pandemic will cause the scales to fall from the eyes of those who do not share it. But this may not happen. The second is that it fails to take account of how the public mood will change once the pandemic ceases. And it will. The third is that it avoids self-questioning. Both left and right are currently guilty of acting as though nothing has really changed. Those on the left who believed before Covid-19 that Britain was collapsing under the weight of social inequality, a lack of Keynesian demand management or the folly of Brexit have looked at the crisis and concluded that, yes, the pandemic proves that they were right all along. Yet those on the right who believed beforehand that the economy was more reliably run in their hands, that borders needed to be rather more tightly controlled, and that nation states must make their own decisions feel equally vindicated. In the same way, when it comes to attitudes towards individual politicians, Johnson's admirers now admire him even more than ever, while his detractors denounce him even more indignantly. It seems obvious to his critics that Johnson is the wrong man for the crisis and equally obvious to them that he is mishandling it so badly he may be overthrown. But the opinion polls don't say that. A lot of people elected Johnson in December and even more think he is doing a good job now.  Everyone in these debates could use a bit of humility and a dose of open-mindedness. That's true on both sides. It's true for all of us. The right has been forced to relearn the prime importance of the state as guarantor in a period of emergency. It is having to accept the state's irreducible responsibility to the most vulnerable. It has also, perhaps, learned that what a health service can achieve reflects the investment that has been made in it, although no health service anywhere has been or could have been fully prepared. But the left has lessons to learn too. Many of the takeaways from the Covid-19 crisis may seem obvious. But what is true during a crisis is not necessarily true or desirable when the crisis is over. The NHS needs whatever it takes in a crisis, but at other times health service spending is as long as a piece of string and there has to be a cut-off point, if only to allow spending elsewhere. The borrowing that may or may not save the economy from recession in a crisis will also have to be paid for when the crisis is over. People may trust Johnson with powers they would not want Jeremy Corbyn to possess. We are sailing in the dark towards an unknown future. Britain's mood after the first world war and the flu pandemic has been described by the historian Richard Overy as 'the morbid age'ù. It was, Overy says, an era of fear and paranoia about a dystopian future. Few put their faith in traditional politics. Britain after the second was very different. 'Never again'was its more optimistic motto. No one can say which of these moods, or what other mood, is likely after the Covid-19 pandemic . Instead of insisting that the pandemic confirms everything we thought beforehand, it would be better to start thinking about all the unwelcome changes that the pandemic may bring in the decade to come.

Pressure to delay Brexit talks as coronavirus crisis grows,-0.25,Negative,"The European Union has toughened its demands on fish in British waters as part of a post-Brexit trade deal, as the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, revealed he had coronavirus, fuelling doubts about the timetable for an agreement. Fishing is set to be one of the most bruising chapters of the EU-UK negotiations, with both sides seeking an agreement by 1 July, a deadline called into question by the coronavirus crisis. An EU legal text published on Wednesday evening revealed a tougher approach on fishing rights, compared with an earlier version. The new text sets the goal of 'upholding '¶ existing reciprocal conditions on access to waters and resources'ù, whereas the previous version set the bar at 'defining clear and stable rules'ù. The changes - demanded by EU member states - underline that national governments are taking a harder line on fishing rights than the EU's chief negotiator, who wants flexibility in the negotiating room. Member states, led by France, Belgium, Denmark and Ireland, are insisting on maintaining the status quo on access rights for their fishing fleets. The British government wants to tear up arrangements formalised decades ago so that it can increase its share of the catch in British waters. The two sides exchanged legal texts on Wednesday, before Barnier announced he had tested positive for the coronavirus, heaping further doubt on the timetable for a deal by the end of the year. 'I am doing well and in good spirits. I am following all the necessary instructions, as is my team,'Barnier wrote on Twitter. 'For all those affected already, and for all those currently in isolation, we will get through this together.'In a video message recorded in a book-lined room, he added: 'Everyone among us has a role to win this collective battle, this war against the virus.'A UK government spokesperson said: 'We send Michel Barnier our best wishes for his recovery.'Confirmation that the virus has spread to the highest levels of the EU negotiating team is bound to fuel calls for both sides to extend the transition period that ends on 31 December 2020. At his daily press conference on Wednesday, Boris Johnson denied reports he would seek an extension of the transition, saying it was 'not a subject that is being regularly discussed'ù. The latest round of talks, due to take place in London this week, were cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak. The two sides have been unable to agree so far on other ways of talking. The UK has said both sides are considering 'alternative ways to continue discussions'ù, such as video conferencing and conference calls. The European commission's chief spokesman, Eric Mamer, said the negotiations would be carried forward. 'We believe that there are ways to ensure that even in the current circumstances, negotiations can continue to take place.'The main focus, he said, was 'textual analysis'of the legal documents exchanged by both sides. But online talks pose problems for the Brussels negotiators. Even the smallest discussions can include 10 to 20 people on each side, coming and going, during one three- or four-hour session. The European commission has asked all 'non-critical'staff to work at home, a message reinforced by the Belgian government when a nationwide lockdown came into force on Wednesday. Meanwhile, civil servants across Whitehall are being deployed to work on the coronavirus. The next round, due to start on 6 April, is now in doubt, as the EU executive and all European governments turn their attention to fighting the coronavirus crisis. Terry Reintke, a German Green MEP, who helped to set up the European parliament's EU-UK friendship group, told the Guardian it was 'absolutely insane'to stick to the original timetable, which is meant to result in a wide-ranging deal on trade, fishing rights and security being agreed by the end of the year. 'I don't think it's going to be possible. I really hope the British government and the British parliament will come to their senses.'She added that a deal was not just 'people meeting in a room'ù, but time for parliamentary scrutiny, informed by experts. The European parliament, which has to approve the final deal, has drastically reduced its activity, with many MEPs unable to leave their home countries. Fabian Zuleeg, the head of the European Policy Centre, a Brussels thinktank, said not extending the transition was 'reckless when faced with unprecedented crisis'ù. 'Remote facilities cannot replace the multiple exchanges that take place during a negotiation round, let alone replicate the personal relationships that make a negotiation work,'he wrote. 'That is particularly crucial in this case, where the timetable is already tight.'The British government has not revealed whether it intends to publish its draft legal text, which was sent to the EU team on Wednesday.  'We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,'a government spokesman said. 'We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them available more widely.'",0,Neutral
The Guardian view on Covid-19 and Brexit: extend the transition,0,Neutral,"If, at this critical moment, the government was to announce plans to put a new burden on business, disrupt supply chains and impede the flow of goods, the reckless folly of it would be obvious. But Boris Johnson does not need to make such an announcement, because the measures come into force automatically at the end of the year. Unless an extension to the Brexit transition period is sought by June, a newly obstructive border will appear between UK ports and the EU single market next January. Customs checks will separate Northern Ireland from mainland Britain. The effect will be delays, costs and a decline in trade volumes. This is not a worst-case scenario in the event that Mr Johnson fails to sign a free-trade agreement in Brussels, but is factored into his model for any deal. The pinnacle of his ambition is a Canada-style model, which is far removed from the seamless arrangements currently in place. Even if most tariffs and quotas are eliminated, there would be checks and friction at the border. The prospect of completing the necessary systems to implement that regime in the time available looked fanciful even before the coronavirus crisis struck. The economic rationale for doing it was dubious then, too. Honouring that deadline when a public-health emergency demands that every aspect of government be reworked, reviewed or suspended is scarcely comprehensible. A round of Brexit negotiations due to be held in London next week has already been cancelled. Officials on both sides of the Channel have more urgent matters to attend to, which in itself is a measure of the scale of the crisis, since the urgency of settling UK-EU relations is not diminished. On the contrary, the prospect of administering a gratuitous economic shock - as every credible analysis of a hard Brexit forecasts - would represent an extraordinary dereliction of duty by the prime minister, who has an available mechanism to avoid it. There might be two reasons why Mr Johnson refrains from hitting the pause button, neither of which is good. One is the fear of looking weak in the eyes of zealous Eurosceptics. Another is if he shares the belief, espoused by those same zealots, that tearing UK businesses out of EU markets can be done without cost - and might even have tonic effects. That myth was generated in a different era, born of ideological allergy to continental regulation coupled with a romantic notion of Britain as a buccaneering sole trader. Such complacency must be shaken now that many UK enterprises are facing a new and unforeseen calamity. Perhaps the practical merits of continuity in trade might at last impose themselves on the Conservatives, who previously relished disruption for its own sake. Mr Johnson's gung-ho Eurosceptic rhetoric once suggested indifference to risk, but in response to coronavirus he appears to have discovered a new capacity to engage with evidence and a new flexibility in economic policy. Such pragmatism must be applied also to the Brexit question. An extension to the transition period will surely have to be sought. Only obsolete doctrine and the prime minister's vanity are against it. Those obstacles can and must be set aside. ",-0.5,Negative
London Brexit talks in doubt because of coronavirus,0,Neutral,"Brexit talks due to take place in London next week have been thrown into doubt because of the coronavirus, Michael Gove has confirmed. Gove told MPs fresh concerns about the second round of talks going ahead as planned had been raised by Brussels counterparts this morning. About 150 delegates from Brussels were due to arrive in London for three days of talks next Wednesday. Gove also said there was a question mark over the inaugural meeting of the EU-UK joint committee, on which he will sit, on 30 March. Asked at the Brexit select committee if talks would be affected by the coronavirus, Gove said: 'It's a live question. We were looking forward to a joint committee in the UK on the 30th and we were also looking forward to the next stage of negotiations going ahead, but we have had indications today from Belgium there may be specific public health concerns.'It is not clear what the fresh concerns are, but Belgium has confirmed its first death from the virus. Last week two cases of the virus were confirmed by authorities in Brussels, one at the European Defence Agency and another at the Council of the European Union. Gove was answering questions at the first Brexit select committee hearing since the election. He defended the decision not to publish an impact assessment of the EU deal the government is pursuing despite issuing a 60-page assessment last week on the impact a deal with the US would have. 'As load-bearing devices go they [impact assessments] are not perhaps the most effective ways of delivering a proper range of views of economic consequences,'he said.As Gove tried to make light of the apparent contradictory positions the government had adopted on impact assessments, he accidentally poured water over his phone and briefing papers. Michael Gove was so pleased with his attempt at humour at the FREU committee he poured water onto his own phone and papers pic.twitter.com/Jkvj83vipQ As head of the exit operations groups and a member of the cabinet's exit strategy group and member of the EU-UK joint committee, Gove is one of the most powerful government ministers in relation to Brexit. He was grilled by MPs over checks on goods to Northern Ireland and other key subjects on which the UK and the EU have clashed. He declined to answer questions about the checks mandated by the Northern Ireland protocol, saying: 'That will be a matter for the joint committee.'His answer appears to underline what sources say is an agreement by both sides to 'deal down the rhetoric'to allow negotiators to get on with the challenging task of getting an outline deal by the June deadline for the 'stock taking'review of talks. The chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster also confirmed that the UK would produce a legal text of its negotiation position but reserved the right not to publish the text until it saw fit. The EU is also producing a legal text of its position with sources saying that when published the two papers will underline how far apart both sides are on key areas - fisheries, state aid and the level playing field and crime and justice. The Labour MP Stephen Kinnock accused the government of misleading voters during the general election campaign by claiming there was an 'oven-ready Brexit'when 'in fact it was at the back of the frozen food section'and nowhere near completion. Kinnock put it to Gove that he knew it would be impossible for Britain to get a quota-free and tariff-free deal if it did not accept alignment with the EU on state aid and the level playing field. Gove hit back saying a frozen food version of Brexit would just take 'longer for the microwave to ping'and in any case it was possible to get something like the 'Marks and Spencer deal you get - a starter, main course and a pudding and you decide which ones you want to get but all for £9.99'ù.

"With coronavirus, the government must extend the Brexit transition period",0,Neutral,"Coronavirus is a threat to the global economy as well as to public health. Every family will be affected and those who have less will feel it the most. In a globally connected world, we are only as strong as the most vulnerable. The government must take a long-term approach to this crisis and run the country like the future matters. In a crisis, uncertainty must be minimised. That is the lesson from the financial crisis in 2008 and every global crisis before it. So first, we must agree with the EU to extend the Brexit transition period. Our businesses and our communities cannot cope with more uncertainty during this outbreak. British companies who trade with the EU do not know what terms they'll be trading on in 10 months' time. Add to this the falling demand and disruption created by coronavirus and it is reasonable to expect many businesses will not survive. The government has boxed itself into a corner by legislating to end the transition period in December come what may. It now faces a direct choice between narrow partisan ideology and the interests of the nation. An extension will mean that British citizens living abroad will be able to access free health care for at least another year, that we are able to continue to access the Early Warning and Response System that helped us tackle the Sars virus and bird flu. Public safety is at stake. This must happen now. Secondly we need to build the defences that will safeguard our economy from the ravages of coronavirus. The Bank of England could reduce interest rates to lower the costs of lending to business but, given interest rates are already low, this is not enough. We should introduce a government-backed guarantee to ensure loans are provided to companies that fall into trouble. We should immediately establish an emergency economic council, and include those who have experience of dealing with the 2008 financial crisis, unions and business leaders to monitor the economic situation as it evolves - introducing further measures such as reducing VAT rates and allowing for payment holidays to keep firms afloat, as well as help for people at risk of losing their homes. My community in Wigan is still dealing with the legacy of the jobs, homes and livelihoods lost in the 1980s, and the scars last a long time. But the economy has changed since then; with a large number of people self-employed, working part-time or on zero-hours contracts, we have far less resilience. That is why, thirdly, we need to think beyond the impact on employers and extend statutory sick pay to the self-employed and to the 2 million people who do not qualify from day one; otherwise many people will simply not be able to afford to self-isolate. This is a public health disaster waiting to happen. We must establish a Covid-19 workers' taskforce with powers to protect people in insecure employment. This means being able to ensure workers are not under pressure to turn up to work when sick, do not lose their jobs if they self-isolate, and receive the sick pay they are entitled to. It will be agency workers in areas such as social care and gig workers who are most at risk of being forced to turn up to work. It is in nobody's interests that they do. Finally, with over-65s most at risk, we need the equivalent of a Marshall plan to protect our older people. Coronavirus has the potential to intensify the loneliness epidemic. Charities should be given access to an emergency fund to support their work, focused on those older people who do not have relatives living close by. With the cost of borrowing currently so low, the government has no excuse not to use Wednesday's budget to direct emergency funding to social care, which will be under severe strain over the coming months. We should be encouraging people to take time off to look after ill relatives rather than increasing pressure on the health and care system. The government should offer to cover the pay of employees needing to become temporary carers. The economic impact is already being felt. On Monday morning we witnessed the FTSE 100 on course for its biggest fall since the 2008 crash. Without clear and decisive action to address the public health, social and economic uncertainty presented by the rapid spread of coronavirus, the government risks leaving us wholly unprepared to deal with the challenges that lie ahead. We must act now. '¢ Lisa Nandy is the Labour MP for Wigan ",1.125,Positive
The ideologues of Downing St now face the opposition of events,-0.875,Negative,"When Harold Macmillan, British prime minister 1957-63, was asked what worried him most, his celebrated reply was 'the opposition of events'ù. This somehow got revised, as such quotes tend to, to 'events, dear boy, events'ù. The beauty of the original reply was that, with his characteristic sardonic wit, Macmillan was also having a crack at the supposed feebleness of the official opposition - Labour - at the time. But that opposition contained some political giants, such as Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell and his opponent in chief, Aneurin Bevan. The two were the titular leaders of the Gaitskellites and the Bevanites. Then, as now, the Labour party was at war with itself; but things were nowhere near as desperate then as they are now. Bevan was often confused in the public mind with Ernest Bevin, foreign secretary in the postwar Attlee government, who died in 1951. Bevin had been a founder of the Transport and General Workers' Union. Just think: whom would you rate higher? Ernest Bevin, who did so much for the Labour movement and the revival of Europe, or the present leader of the TGWU's successor, Len McCluskey, and Boris Johnson's foreign secretary, Dominic Raab? A latter-day Macmillan would no doubt be tempted to make a similar crack about the state of the present Labour opposition. The Johnson/Dominic Cummings alliance was on the ropes last autumn, but then, led by the naive and inexperienced Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, the opposition parties fell into the trap prepared for them and precipitated the election that Johnson and Cummings needed to get off the hook. However, there is no latter-day Macmillan in sight. Apart from anything else, he was a leader of the Conservative party. I was talking recently to a former member of the Thatcher government who said: 'It is no longer the Conservative party. It is the Brexit party.'And Johnson and Cummings, the driving force behind the Brexit government, have been hit by 'events'ù, of which the most obvious is the coronavirus crisis and the resulting pan-panic. In facing up to this, they need all the help they can get from the civil service machine, rather than going out of their way to antagonise it in the way that the egregious Cummings has been urging. The economic impact of Storm Corona is mounting by the day, disrupting businesses from airlines to the hospitality trade. Moreover, via globalised supply lines, the economic consequences of the reaction to the spread of the virus look like a precursor to the hit to supply lines, output and jobs threatened by a cliff-edge, no-deal Brexit. I know reasonable people who are saying that there is a lot of sabre-rattling going on and that it will be in the interest of both sides to compromise; but that is not the way it looks to me. The British 'negotiator'ù, David Frost, has dug in with the proclamation that 'sovereignty'is more important than economic wellbeing. His thinking seems to be that, because we are sovereign, we can choose to abandon the benefits of the single market Margaret Thatcher helped to set up - just to prove that we are sovereign! Meanwhile, the EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, continues - understandably - to try to hold Johnson to promises he made on the record about adhering to present social and environmental regulations after this year's transition period. Alas, truth, facts and promises are not high on the scale of Johnson's priorities. What matters in the chaos of Downing Street is 'belief'ù. Which brings us back to Macmillan's 'events'and their impact on this week's budget from Rishi Sunak, the latest chancellor of the exchequer - a true Brexit believer. Before the onset of the virus, my friend Jagjit Chadha, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, warned that the promised increase in public investment of about £20bn a year would be 'unlikely to have more than a modest impact on productivity and is not expected to offset the negative impact of Brexit'ù. There has been much pre-budget discussion of how the government's fiscal rules could inhibit the chancellor's scope at a time when productivity growth is negligible and unemployment relatively low. There has also been much discussion of how rules are made to be broken. The advent of the pan-panic may impel those well-known economic advisers Johnson and Cummings to urge the chancellor to throw caution to the winds. But the important point is that the event of the virus and its consequences assumes more importance for economic policy, both fiscal and monetary, than whatever the longer-term aims of Cummings and co may be. Pragmatism rules - not ideology. ",0,Neutral
It's not just chlorinated chicken: five foods a US trade deal could bring to the UK,0,Neutral,"Nothing symbolises British fears of a standard-slashing US trade deal better than chlorinated chickens: those zombie birds, barely able to move, cluck or feed, stuffed with chemicals that force them to grow to unbelievable sizes, sitting in their own waste, covered in sores rather than feathers. At the end of their miserable life of confinement, they are washed in chlorine or a similar chemical to get rid of the bacteria that infect them. In fact, the wash is believed to hide rather than eliminate some bacteria, potentially driving much higher rates of food poisoning in the US, not to mention the appallingly treated workers in the industry who suffer 'rashes, burns, destruction of the eye tissue, difficulty breathing, and inflammation of the respiratory system'as a result of exposure. But chicken is only the tip of the iceberg. Despite government claims, here are five other unpleasant foods that could make their way to our menus as part of a UK-US trade deal. Much US meat is produced on an industrial scale, with conditions as bad as those in the chicken sheds. In particular, hormones, steroids and antibiotics are regularly used to make animals bigger and faster, and to prevent them getting ill in the unnaturally close conditions in which they are kept. Many cows and pigs never see sunlight, walk freely or eat grass. Many of the chemicals used are bad for us too - antibiotic overuse is threatening to make these vital drugs useless, and to bring down a pillar of modern medicine. Another chemical, ractopamine, is regularly fed to industrially farmed pigs in the US, despite making the animals collapse, turn aggressive, suffer liver and kidney dysfunction, and even die. But it probably affects humans too, which is why not just the EU but also Russia and China have banned this dangerous chemical, as well as US pork that contains it. The majority of US processed foods contain genetically modified ingredients, unlike British food. The US is demanding a 'science-based'approach to food. This sounds good, but in trade deals 'science-based'is a shorthand for more genetically modified food and more intensive chemical use. It contrasts with the EU's precautionary principle, which takes a cautious approach to health risks and bans foods where there's a credible risk to health. In the US, the balance of proof works the other way, and there is a high barrier that has to be passed before 'harm'translates into regulation. Lead paint, banned in most of Europe before the second world war, was not prohibited in the US until 1978. Boris Johnson and his lead negotiator to the EU have talked about the need for the UK's approach to food standards to be 'governed by science'ù. GM is coming this way. US rules allow milk to have nearly double the level of somatic cells - white blood cells that fight bacterial infection - that the UK allows. In practice, this means more pus in our milk, and more infections going untreated in cows. Much US milk would be deemed unfit for human consumption in Britain. Vegans don't escape unscathed, because the US allows far more pesticide residue on fruit and vegetables, and allows 72 chemicals banned in the EU, including some responsible for serious harm. That's before we get to the truly horrific - the rat hair, insect fragments and excrement traces that the US allows in small amounts in food. Even baby food carries higher risks in the US. In Britain, baby food has special standards including a complete ban on artificial colours and E-numbers, very low maximum levels of pesticides and limits on added sugar. The US has no specific regulations for baby food. A recent test of baby foods in the US found that 95% contained toxic metals, with 73% containing traces of arsenic. While the amounts may be small, the lack of tight regulation on US baby foods, and the certainty that sugar is often added to toddler snack food, should cause deep disquiet. Britain currently protects certain foods to ensure they're made to specific standards and to promote local farming and industry. Think Cornish pasties, Melton Mowbray pork pies, Scottish wild salmon and Stilton blue cheese. In trade talks to date, the US has 'pressed the UK to move away from current EU approach on generic terms'ù. American companies would be able to produce Cornish pasties on a massive scale and sell them back to us. The US also wants to 'eliminate '¶ unjustified labelling'saying it unfairly discriminates against American foods and, incredibly, the administration 'view[s] the introduction of warning labels as harmful rather than as a step to public health'ù. These are not marginal concerns for the US - food is not an aspect of a future deal that Britain will be able to simply opt out of. It is central to US objectives that call for 'greater regulatory compatibility to reduce burdens associated with unnecessary differences in regulations and standards'including 'a mechanism to remove expeditiously unwarranted barriers that block the export of US food and agricultural products'ù. The US trade deal is a threat to our food standards and our farmers, and the US will not sign a deal that doesn't have food standards in it.

Rishi Sunak's free ports plan reinvents Thatcherism for the Johnson era,0.375,Positive,"In 2016, a little-known Conservative MP authored a paper for the Centre for Policy Studies, the free-market thinktank founded by Keith Joseph and Margaret Thatcher. Looking ahead to Britain's post-Brexit future, the report argued, the government should seize the opportunity to create a string of free ports across the country to revive manufacturing. These engines of economic growth would reconnect Britain with its 'proud maritime history'and act as a 'beacon of British values'ù. The MP in question was Rishi Sunak. Four years later, Britain has left the EU, Sunak has been promoted to chancellor of the exchequer, and Boris Johnson is shaping the direction of Britain's economy. If Johnsonism, as Ferdinand Mount writes, 'is not a continuation of Thatcherism at all'ù, Sunak's 2016 proposal should make us wonder. His recent plan for free ports, based on the 2016 report, reheats an idea that first gained prominence under Thatcher's government, and reeks of precisely the free-market ideas from which the new government is supposedly distancing itself. Though the Conservative party's post-Brexit economic worldview has often been likened to 'Singapore-on-Thames'ù, Sunak's vision is more Tennessee-on-Tyne. Free ports most resemble the foreign trade zones that have existed in the US since the 1930s, where goods aren't subject to tariffs until (and if) they cross over into the domestic market. US free trade zones work because of conditions the UK doesn't share, including higher tariffs on car parts that make it cheaper for companies to manufacture finished cars in US free trade zones. Sober observers of the free port policy realise the difficulties that the UK would have in making a success of it. One consultant, Neil Davidson, reminded MPs in 2019 that the UK actually had five free ports until 2012. It allowed them to lapse because there was no advantage to be gained beyond the considerable advantages the UK already enjoyed from its EU membership. But the real utility of free ports may in fact be ideological. They are reminiscent of the free-market enterprise zones policy that first gained popularity during the Thatcher era, the unlikely brainchild of anarchist city planner Peter Hall and Thatcher's longest-serving cabinet minister, Geoffrey Howe. Michael Heseltine helped set up enterprise zones in places such as Corby, Wakefield, Liverpool and the Isle of Dogs in London. By freeing discrete areas of the city from regulations and taxes, they were ostensibly intended to cut red tape and unleash grassroots entrepreneurship - exposing the limitations of top-down state investment in the process. Yet their legacy was mixed. Total net employment benefits were small, and the policy was costly. Speaking to the US libertarian thinktank the Heritage Foundation in 1980, the historian Paul Johnson described the zones as a 'dagger aimed at the heart of socialism'ù. The 'localised freedom'of low taxes and deregulation, wrote Stuart Butler, a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, can 'act like a benign cancer'ù, rotting 'the foundations of the unfree state around it'ù. In 1980s Britain, the benefits of enterprise zones flowed largely to property investors. One of their success stories was the Isle of Dogs, an area that exemplifies the lopsided growth and extremes of inequality that Johnson's government seeks to level out. A slowdown in the global economy since 2008 has led nation states across the world to offer ever-more inducements to would-be corporate investors. The world is full of zones designed for this purpose - nearly 5,400 by the latest estimates, with 1,000 new zones appearing in the last five years. In many cases, the zonification of the Earth has led to what critics long feared: a race to the bottom. Free trade zones splinter the world into jurisdictions engaged in a constant competition to attract multinational companies, locking nations into a global 'place war'to offer businesses the most enticing incentives and the lowest labour costs. In some places, the exemptions granted to businesses in free trade zones have ripped important rules to ribbons. In Bangladesh, the Chittagong free zone banned strikes and reportedly paid workers less than the minimum wage, while in a free zone in the Philippines, state police battled with private security guards over government plans to enact health and safety regulations. The attraction of free zones for corporations is clear: trade state bureaucracy for your own rules. Free zones make tax, labour law and health and safety regulations into a service that companies can opt out of. After Brexit, the UK will be free to introduce free ports as it chooses. Yet it's unlikely that the country will be able to compete with the world's most successful free port, Jebel Ali, in the United Arab Emirates, where corporations, as Davidson noted in 2019, enjoy '0% corporation tax, no VAT, no income tax, no taxation at all'ù. Far from bringing tangible economic benefits, the more likely outcome of UK free ports is shifting existing jobs into enclaves around the country, as companies chase the tax breaks on offer. This is perhaps the most plausible way to understand the free ports strategy. Rather than 'level up'the UK as a tool of economic policy, their real agenda may be to deepen an ethos of market competition, entrench the power of corporations and reinvent Thatcherism, Johnson-style, for the 2020s.

Letters: Labour can't deny Tony Blair's achievements,0,Neutral,"It was so good to read Andrew Rawnsley's comments on the success of Tony Blair and Labour winning three elections in a row and listing just some of the many achievements over this period ('Tony Blair and the left's perverse preference for failure over success'ù, Comment). It is shameful that none of the Labour leadership candidates is brave enough to give him credit. They should remember that if it hadn't been for him the Tories would have been in power instead, resulting in us losing our NHS, the BBC and the welfare state, and these candidates would never have been heard of.Linda TheobaldLondon NW9 Rawnsley rightly notes that so many Labour people fail to acknowledge Blair's mastery of politics, but their mistrust of him is not just over Iraq. As Peter Mandelson famously said, New Labour was intensely relaxed about the filthy rich 'as long as they pay their taxes'ù. But they didn't and they don't. Despite brilliant innovations, of which Sure Start was the least recognised and most successful, such a casual view of inequality ruined any chance of a Labour government embedding a lasting respect for social justice in the nation's consciousness.Dr Sebastian Kraemer London SW2 Despite Blair's best efforts, the free-market social democracy that prevailed throughout the late 90s and beyond to no small extent helped put in place the economic and social structures that were a prerequisite to and that acted as a launchpad for the hardline austerity of the Cameron, Osborne and May years. Many on the Labour left take the view that Blairism, with its large parliamentary majorities, did little to reverse the drift toward the glaring social and economic inequality that now blights this country and which has led to much of the intolerance we see around us. It is not 'an eccentrically self-destructive relationship with the concept of success'that compels many on the Labour left to regret Blairism and to be reluctant to contest another election under a version of its ideologically empty banner. It is an understanding that electoral success is a necessary, but not totally complete, condition to effect real and lasting social justice. For that, to quote French economist Thomas Piketty: 'We need ideas and ideologies and we need to take them seriously.'We need to win, but we need to win by believing in something more than just winning.Ron FoulkesNewcastle-under-Lyme Kenan Malik's article is a timely reminder of how our democracy is being undermined by the hypocrisy of the super-rich ('Charity clearly doesn't begin at home for Jeff Bezos'ù, Comment). Ten years ago, I wrote a letter to several multibillionaires, including Warren Buffet and Bill Gates, asking them two simple questions: 'What is the hourly rate of workers in your companies and how much tax do you pay in countries where you made your profits?'Needless to say, there was no reply. It is a shameful fact that inequality widens in tandem with corporate profits. Simple changes to our tax system, such as a financial transaction tax and enforcing tax collection more rigorously, would have an immediate impact and Bezos, Gates and Buffet et al would not have a spare $10bn lying around to throw at their 'latest philanthropic wheeze'ù.  These billionaires are the cause of the twin crises of climate change and inequality. We need visionary leaders and governments that will take responsibility rather than abdicate it to global contractors who have become a virtual branch of government.Dr Christina KadirBrighton Harriet Sherwood's article on the British fishing industry stated that 'currently EU boats are entitled to more than 60% of overall landings by weight from the seas around the UK'¶ the UK is allocated 9% of Channel cod, while the French get 84%'('Battle of the high seas'ù, Special Report). In the 1980s, the European commission made finance available for the modernisation of boats and fishing tackle to improve the efficiency of the industry and to ensure overfishing was reduced. This money had to be match-funded by national governments, something the then UK government refused to do, unlike other European governments. This resulted in our fishermen being unable to compete with the modernised fleets of our neighbours, leading to many smaller fishermen either selling out to larger UK fishing companies or selling their quota to other countries. Europe did not 'steal our fish'ù, as claimed by Ukip, but paid money for the right to catch more fish in our waters.Veronica Hardstaff, former Labour MEP for Lincolnshire and Humberside South, and member of the European parliament fishing committee 1996-9, Sheffield It was interesting to read Emma John's article on the proposed ban on protests at the 2020 Olympics ('IOC's Tokyo protest ban is the latest chapter in a rich history of hypocrisy'ù, Sport). As well as the example of Tommie Smith and John Carlos in 1968, there was a brave and poignant demonstration at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Sohn Kee-Cheung was the winner of the marathon that year. He was the world record holder and just 23 at the time, but he did not run for his country of birth, Korea. Instead, he ran as a member of the Japanese Olympic team. In May 1910, Japan had made Korea its protectorate. The Japanese were eager to do well in Berlin, so they sent Sohn and fellow Korean Nam Sung-yong. Sohn delivered, with Nam taking bronze. In winning, he set a new Olympic record time of two hours 29 minutes. At the victory ceremony, the name of the winner was announced as Son Kitei, the Japanese version of the characters in his name. And next to that was the name of the country, Japan. As the Japanese national anthem played after the medals were awarded, the two Korean runners bowed their heads. Sohn was brave enough to show the world his political views in the most public way, potentially at great danger to himself, given that the Olympics were in Nazi Berlin, whose leaders were close to those of Japan.Bob WolfsonRudford, Gloucestershire Sheila Rowbotham's article on 50 years since the start of the Women's Liberation Movement brought back many uplifting memories of my involvement ('In 1970, driven by chaos and energy, we felt like pioneers in female protest'ù, Comment). However, although she rightly reminds us of what we all owe to women activists of the past, she is typically modest about her own achievements. It was her writing that persuaded many of us that our voices needed to be heard. For me, it was her book Women's Consciousness, Man's World that provided an epiphany: her forthright and passionate comments on the reasons for women's inequality are coupled with sympathetic understanding and gentle humour. Sheila's method was (and still is) to encourage and possibly cajole rather than lay hostile blame. Her successes should teach us all that talking and collective action work best.Eva Tutchell Teddington, Middlesex ",1.25,Positive
O Canada? Why Johnson's Brexit songsheet is full of bum notes,0,Neutral,"Britain's most pressing problem is the government's determination to fashion a hard Brexit. And if not that, then a no-deal Brexit. Of course, there is also the potential for a colossal economic sideswipe to the economy from the coronavirus epidemic, while flooding is causing huge harm to towns and villages in the west of England and Wales, and the Treasury is preparing a budget that will probably disguise a limited, piecemeal increase in spending, with exaggerated talk of government action to level up the regions. These threats are not yet structural problems to match Boris Johnson's demand that the EU offer a Canada-style agreement, one that gives easy entry to EU markets without strings attached, a proposal that cannot fly in Brussels and could mean the UK ends up with no deal. Johnson says that unless the EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, sits down to consider the UK proposal seriously, and embarks on talks in good faith in the coming months, Britain will walk away as early as June. There is no explanation in the government's official negotiating mandate, published last week, that addresses why the EU should want to offer Britain near-zero tariffs on manufactured or agricultural products, zero fees and charges and permanently suspend any quotas that apply to non-EU countries. With nothing in return and no way to stop Britain from abusing state-aid rules, anti-dumping regulations or environmental rules without going to the recently neutered World Trade Organization, the EU would be foolish to agree. What about Canada, says Johnson? Well, there are three things to say about the Canada trade deal. First, Canada does not pose the same challenge to EU industries that the UK does. Second, the Canada deal (Ceta) contains an arbitration mechanism that the UK believes inferior to the standard version. And it does not cover financial services. The arch-Brexiter David Davis said in his Twitter feed: 'There has been a lot of bluster and sabre rattling from the EU over the past few days. The reality is that if the EU loses access to our markets, it will do serious damage to their economy.'There are those in the debate who focus on how Johnson signed a political declaration with the EU last year that promised 'equivalence'and that he has conveniently forgotten that. Others say the UK stance should be seen more as an opening gambit that simply adopts a 'minimalist'position, rather than one that openly contradicts anything said or signed previously. Still, it must seem bizarre to Barnier that the UK should demand the EU consider huge restrictions on Spanish, French and Dutch boats entering British waters in a separately negotiated fisheries agreement while he is supposed to accept banking and insurance gets unfettered and permanent access to EU markets as part of the overall deal. It remains cherry-picking to anyone with an ounce of sense. To Johnson and his on/off/on friend Michael Gove, it is a perfectly reasonable request. There are those who are sympathetic to the idea of side-deals to tackle specific issues such as fishing. They cite how the EU signed more than 100 separate trade deals with Switzerland as reason to push for something similar. Sadly for the Brexiter, the Swiss deals have always made for a poor analogy. They came with a demand for free movement of people, which the Swiss accepted. And worse for the UK, the EU is currently negotiating with Berne to turn the 100-odd deals into one huge one, with an arbitration mechanism that doesn't just cover private sector disputes, but can also be invoked by EU governments concerned that level playing field rules are being abused. The Swiss have so far demurred. Their punishment has been swift and severe: Brussels has cut off EU investors' access to the Zurich and Berne stock markets. And all this is before we address the Northern Ireland protocol, which demands checks on goods at the border between the region and the British mainland, and is described by local politicians as a betrayal. Or Johnson's starting point that the UK should have the right to 'adopt or modify its labour laws'and the same for environmental legislation. Gove says he will honour the protocol to further a deal with the EU. Others in the cabinet make noises about signing a deal and then ignoring the protocol, in the hope that Brussels will be ground down by Whitehall's deliberate foot-dragging and eventually abandon a Northern Ireland customs border. The Swiss example says this is wrongheaded and that a no-deal Brexit - or the most basic, hardest of Brexits - is where the Conservative party is taking Britain. ",-1.625,Negative
The Guardian view on food and Brexit: trust is not on the menu,0,Neutral,"Most people pay little attention to the chain of production that brings food to their plates. Americans eat tonnes of chicken every year, unaware of, or unconcerned by, the chemical rinse applied to its pre-cooked carcass. British consumers might also eat chlorine-washed chicken if they had acquired the habit, but since they haven't the idea is unappetising. This is a problem in transatlantic trade talks because US agribusiness wants access to UK dining tables. The politics of serving food prepared to US safety standards is tricky on a number of levels. Alongside chlorinated chicken, the use of growth-promoting hormones and antibiotics in meat production are more tightly regulated in Europe than in many countries that want to export their surplus meat. After Brexit, the UK can abandon EU standards, but if it does so it will find its produce barred from continental markets. Eurosceptics call that protectionism, and partly it is. European food safety standards have a scientific rationale - the idea is that hygiene should be maintained all along the chain, not dealt with at the last stage by blasting microbes with disinfectant. But those rules are bundled up with a system that insulates the sector from global competition. The EU subsidises farmers, recognising how destabilising it would be if a glut of cheap American produce was dumped on their markets. Some Eurosceptics embrace that destabilisation as an economic tonic, others deny it would happen. Pro-leave campaigners advertised cheaper food as a benefit of Brexit, omitting to explain that a price would be paid by farmers. That sleight of hand was easier to accomplish in propaganda than as government policy. The National Farmers' Union vehemently opposes lowering regulatory barriers to American produce. The NFU president, Minette Batters, this week said doing so would be 'insane'and 'morally bankrupt'ù. Downing Street insists high standards will be maintained, but Boris Johnson wants a trade deal with the US and is not renowned for keeping his word. George Eustice, the environment secretary, tries to assuage farmers' fears without giving them explicit guarantees. The EU has been less ambiguous. Michel Barnier insists that the application of common standards across the single market will not be compromised as a favour to Britain. Access depends on alignment and, as Mr Barnier noted this week, the geographical proximity of the UK to the rest of Europe makes the enforcement of standards across post-Brexit borders all the more important. As the European commission sees it, such a near neighbour could easily become an entrep√¥t for substandard produce. That explains EU frustration at Tory MPs' habit of downplaying or dismissing the requirement for controls at Irish Sea ports. The preservation of an all-Ireland regulatory space under the withdrawal agreement makes such checks necessary once mainland Britain diverges from EU rules. Northern Ireland's Unionists hate that idea and Mr Johnson hates admitting that he let them down, but those are not grounds to renege on a treaty. The prime minister can try persuading Mr Barnier to turn a blind eye to changes in UK food standards; he can try persuading British consumers to eat chlorinated chicken; he can try persuading farmers to accept being undercut by American imports. But he will struggle in two ways. First, standards are settled by law, not trust. Second, Mr Johnson has proved that he cannot in any case be trusted. The prime minister keeps serving up rehashed Brexit promises, but they get ever harder to swallow. ",-0.375,Negative
Are we entering a new era of farming?,0,Neutral,"Christopher de Bellaigue makes quite a jump from the 1947 Agriculture Act and its guaranteed payments system to the EU arable area payments regime (Is this the future of farming?, 25 February). Once again under the 'oven ready'new environmental land management proposals, farmers - as they mostly always have done - will be asked to farm under some sort of intrusive government regulation. In return for what? There is no disagreement that farming is a risky enterprise, needing good forward planning and security, and with climate change this will get worse. Having farmed under the transitional arrangements, with arable area and hill subsidies still in place, some sort of transition will still be necessary and a fallback, either through tax regulations or a form of 'agrilite'subsidy support mechanism, will help farmers in the transition. Farming without direct support may produce a generation of growers prepared to farm intensively without subsidy and with their own nods to biodiversity, causing a denudation of hills and marginal land with the subsequent loss of rural communities. All parts of the UK can benefit from more environmentally friendly farming practices, but to succeed the regulations must be less intrusive and not dilute much of the good work, done by the UK and EU in partnership, on reducing the input of agricultural chemicals, and on water and air qualityChris Jones(Nature reserve manager), Biddenham, Bedford '¢ Christopher de Bellaigue covers in depth many aspects of the problems we face in our management of the land. He mentions very briefly 'mixed'farming which is using a rotational system whereby fertility removed by arable crops is returned by other crops such as turnips and grass leys used by grazing animals. Thomas Coke invented the Norfolk four-course rotation and put it into practice on his Holkham estate in Norfolk. In 2015, over 140 years later, a similar updated six-course rotation was introduced on the same estate and the results in terms of increased yields etc have been remarkable. As somebody who farmed in the era of chemical farming, I think it fair to say that many farmers, with much encouragement from the fertiliser and chemical giants, found there was no need to rotate and basically forgot how to farm. This has ultimately resulted in deterioration of soil structure, wildlife habitats, and water quality, and obviously cannot continue. A return to a sustainable rotational system is not impossible, and the old farming chestnut 'farm the land as though you are going to live forever and run the farm business as if you were going to die tomorrow'should be remembered.Kevin CaveneyWick, Glastonbury, Somerset   '¢ Christopher de Bellaigue accurately sets out the facts which will ensure that British farming is about to enter a process of major change. In doing so he points out that 71% of the land area of Britain is devoted to farming, yet this industry only produces 10% of greenhouse gas emissions. In a previous Guardian article (Lab-grown food will soon destroy farming - and save the planet, George Monbiot, 8 January) it was suggested that agriculture is a major source of GG emission. Would it not be better if we were to concentrate on reducing the 90% of greenhouse gas emissions that emanate from only 30% of the land area?Richard HarveyOakham, Rutland  '¢ Join the debate - email guardian.letters@theguardian.com '¢ Read more Guardian letters - click here to visit gu.com/letters '¢ Do you have a photo you'd like to share with Guardian readers?

Johnson unveils major review of foreign and defence policy,0.625,Positive,"Boris Johnson has unveiled a post-Brexit review of foreign and defence policy in an attempt to determine Britain's national security strategy for the next five years. The six-month exercise is another step in the prime minister's assertion of control following the controversial cabinet reshuffle, and comes amid growing cyber threats and uncertainty about the UK's place in the world. It will be led by Sir Alex Ellis, a civil servant, with input from Dominic Cummings, who has been a sharp critic of overspending by the Ministry of Defence and of the methods of BAE Systems and other key contractors. Some Whitehall sources said the appointment of Ellis amounted to a defeat for Cummings, who they said had been struggling to appoint officials to work on the review because of his aggressive reputation across Whitehall. But while Ellis will report directly to Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary and Britain's most powerful civil servant, the terms of review made clear it would also involve 'a small team in Downing Street comprised of experts from inside and outside the civil service'ù. Defence and security reviews traditionally take place every five years, but this one will be different as it will be considering the country's foreign policy needs at a time when the UK has just left the EU and as it weighs up how closely it wants to be aligned to the United States. Prof Malcolm Chalmers from the Royal United Services Institute thinktank said: 'What they have to deal with is an increased uncertainty about our long-term relationship with Europe on one hand, and whether we can rely on Donald Trump's United States on the other.'But there was criticism from some experts because Downing Street is allowing the review to run at the same time as the comprehensive spending review - which they said meant that any of its conclusions would be limited by wider financial constraints. Dr Alan Mendoza, executive director of the Henry Jackson Society thinktank, said he believed that was 'a major victory of the civil service over the PM's advisers'ù.  'The announced approach risks decisions on our foreign policy strategy being overtaken by short-term financial concerns,'he said. The Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence, and other government departments and agencies will feed into the central review team, while final decisions will be taken by the National Security Council, a group of senior ministers chaired by the prime minister. Key issues under consideration will be how far the UK wants to develop an integrated offensive hacking capability after turf wars between the Ministry of Defence and GCHQ have hampered progress since the previous 2015 review, at a time when Russia and China are engaged in long-term, low-level cyber warfare. It will also take a particular look at how the MoD and intelligence agencies purchase equipment in a nod to Cummings, who has made little secret of his criticisms of defence budgeting, which has historically favoured large capital spending on aircraft carriers and sophisticated jet fighters. Last March, before returning to government, Johnson's chief aide wrote that the procurement process 'has continued to squander billions of pounds, enriching some of the worst corporate looters and corrupting public life via the revolving door of officials/lobbyists'ù. Tackling serious and organised crime will also form part of the review, which is an area traditionally under-resourced compared with spending on combating terrorism, prompting some analysts to ask whether the review could lead to a revamp of the much criticised National Crime Agency. The previous 2015 review had tried to focus spending on fighting Isis and other non-state terror organisations by emphasising the need for smaller expeditionary and special forces. But those involved said it underestimated Russia's conventional military capability, which has enabled the Kremlin to become a major player in the Syrian civil war. As he announced the review Boris Johnson said: 'As the world changes we must move with it - harnessing new technologies and ways of thinking to ensure British foreign policy is rooted firmly in our national interests, now and in the decades ahead.'",0,Neutral
Downing Street rejects EU's 'onerous' opening trade offer,-0.875,Negative,"No 10 has accused the EU of trying to give the UK a worse trade deal than those offered to the US, Canada and Japan, as the two sides clashed ahead of crucial talks scheduled to take just 40 days. With the opening round of talks due to start on Monday, Downing Street publicly rejected the EU's opening offer for a trade deal and said it did not recognise the need for a 'level playing field'for competition. It said Brussels was trying to impose 'onerous commitments'that would undermine the UK's legal autonomy and right to set its own regulations. 'The EU has respected the autonomy of other major economies around the world such as Canada and Japan when signing trade deals with them. We just want the same,'a No 10 spokesman said. 'We agree the UK's trade with the EU is significant. The US's [trade] is on the same scale - yet that did not stop the EU being willing to offer the US zero tariffs without the kind of level playing field commitments or the legal oversight they have put in today's mandate.'The EU's mandate stated that any future relationship with the UK should be 'underpinned by robust commitments to ensure a level playing field for open and fair competition, given the EU and the UK's geographic proximity and economic interdependence'ù. This accords with the political declaration signed by both parties when Brexit took place. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, also unveiled a compromise position on regulation that falls short of requiring the UK to follow all EU rules in future. The offer involves Brussels retaining the right to apply tariffs or other sanctions if any divergence between the two sides over time leads to 'disruptions of the equal condition of competition'ù, with EU law being the 'reference point'ù. However, Downing Street reacted negatively to the suggestion and claimed it did not recognise the need for a 'level playing field'between the UK and EU at all, in spite of the goals of the political declaration. 'Level playing field is an EU construct, not a piece of terminology which we use,'Boris Johnson's official spokesman said. 'We have been very clear on our commitment to discuss open and fair competition as part of negotiations, but we will not accept any demands for the UK to follow EU rules, just as we would not expect the EU to accept UK laws.'Johnson's spokesman also accused the EU of reneging on the political declaration by not sticking to its timetable governing talks on financial services and data adequacy. The first four days of talks are due to start on Monday, with fresh rounds every couple of weeks alternating in location between London and Brussels. The two sides expect 10 rounds of four days, taking the total time set aside to about 40 days before the autumn. Britain is to set out its own negotiating mandate on Thursday. But with the UK effectively threatening to walk away if Brussels insists on sticking to the same rulebook and legal oversight by European courts, Barnier told reporters on Tuesday the EU would 'not conclude an agreement at any price'ù. He warned that if there was to be any chance of a deal by the end of the year, there could be no 'backtracking'by the UK on past commitments made in the withdrawal agreement and the accompanying political declaration. 'If we want to build up a future relationship in the long term based on trust with the UK, we need to make sure that we have trust in the short term,'he said. 'This is predicated on the proper implementation of the withdrawal agreement that has already been signed and ratified. If you read the political declaration that was signed by Boris Johnson, that was negotiated by him and his team, we are not that far apart. In the political declaration every single word counts.'He added: 'If we want to succeed in the very short period of time that Mr Johnson has chosen, we need to make sure that we don't start backtracking where we should be making progress.'Barnier warned that negotiations would be 'difficult, perhaps even very difficult'but pointed to the successful negotiation of the withdrawal agreement as a sign that the two sides could end up coming to a deal. 'If you look at the discussion with the UK a couple of years ago on the financial settlement, there were many issues that were controversial,'he said. Downing Street said the UK would 'engage constructively'but Johnson's No 10 has put less emphasis on achieving a deal than under Theresa May's administration. A senior government source said the whole point of Brexit was freeing the UK to make its own laws and 'you either get the whole point of Brexit or you don't'ù. The source also firmly rejected the idea of allowing any new infrastructure to be built to facilitate any trade checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The main sources of tension in the negotiation will be how far the UK follows the EU's rulebook and whether the European Court of Justice has any oversight affecting the UK. However, there is also likely to be disagreement over fishing rights. Brussels' negotiating mandate demands that the UK continues to allow EU fishing fleets access to British waters, but Britain wants a separate annual agreement on access and quotas. Another disputed clause in the mandate is the EU's demand that the UK maintains a ban on chlorinated chicken to protects European meat exports but this would creates a potential obstacle to the UK striking a deal with Donald Trump. On the recommendation of France, a clause was inserted to insist that both sides maintain 'health and product sanitary quality in the food and agriculture sector'ù. The paragraph called 'Environment and Health'provides a catch-all insurance for the EU that certain methods of food production - including particular pesticides, endocrine disrupters and chlorine washes for poultry - will not be used in the UK. At the weekend, George Eustice, the new UK environment secretary, refused to guarantee that the government would not allow the importation of chlorine-washed chicken as part of a trade deal with the US. The EU's position was backed by the National Farmers' Union, whose president, Minette Batters, said it would be 'morally bankrupt'and 'insane'of Johnson to drop the UK's high farming and food standards in order to strike a US deal.

The Guardian view on Eurovision 2020: don't blame the public,-0.5,Negative,"Asked why Britain struggles so badly at the Eurovision song contest, Abba's Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus made it sound simple in a recent interview. It was, he said, a question of finding 'the right songwriters'ù. Yes indeed. But what might seem straightforward for Mr Ulvaeus has become horribly complicated for the United Kingdom, which has underperformed in the competition to a startling degree for more than 20 years. Britain's last victory came in 1997, with Love, Shine a Light by Katrina and the Waves. Years of failure and sometimes outright humiliation followed, most famously in 2003, when Jemini finished last with no points at all. Last year Michael Rice fared little better, scoring a miserable 11 points and also finishing at the bottom of the pile. The BBC, which both screens the event and presides over the selection of the UK entry, has decided this year that enough is enough. Courageously, given current rows over the future of the licence fee, the corporation has in effect fired the general public, which has dismally failed to pick anything resembling a winner for the past four years. Responsibility for choosing and shaping this year's British offering, which will be unveiled on Thursday, has been farmed out to the record label and publisher BMG. One BBC spokesperson, speaking with a little less than total conviction, said the deal with BMG was 'a turning point for the UK at Eurovision. We very much hope this marks the start of an exciting new chapter.'The rest of us can only wait and see whether a suspension of democratic process brings a new, ruthless focus to Britain's approach, as it seeks to win friends in post-Brexit Europe. But it is far from clear that the catalogue of failures can be blamed solely on the audience on the sofa. In 2007, for example, the BBC itself chose the six candidate acts from which the public then selected the winner. The bubblegum pop group Scooch was subsequently accused of turning the nation into a laughing stock with Flying the Flag (For You), accompanied by a bathetically erotic dance routine in which the band dressed up as airline stewards; it achieved joint 22nd place. In 2012 and 2013 the public had no role in the selection process at all. Playing safe with old stagers such as Engelbert Humperdinck and Bonnie Tyler, Britain still finished 25th and 19th. In truth, the priorities of the UK music industry, traditionally one of the most successful and creative in the world, have usually been elsewhere. As Mr Ulvaeus points out, Britain has not seemed to be trying very hard at times. Until losing badly year after year became a bit annoying, much of the nation appeared to revel in the late Terry Wogan's annual performance of wry amusement. All in all, Britain came across on finals night as a bit too cool for school, a look that almost certainly led other countries' jurors to exact an obvious form of revenge. Well, who's sorry now? BMG has identified its priority as 'coming up with a good song'ù. That seems the right place to start. ",0,Neutral
Met says no evidence of 'furniture theft' against Commons photographer,0,Neutral,"A former official House of Commons photographer who captured 'renaissance style'photos of Theresa May and John Bercow during the Brexit drama of last year has been told he will not be investigated further after parliamentary authorities suspected him of taking historic furniture, lampshades and candlesticks from parliament. Mark Duffy said he was 'absolutely relieved'to have heard from the police that the case was closed, ending two weeks of stress and anxiety. A team of Metropolitan police officers searched Mark Duffy's London house 10 days ago on the basis of a court order obtained by the parliamentary liaison and investigations team seeking any 'Pugin-designed furniture, candlesticks, ceramics, clocks or lamps'ù. The photographer said he was shocked by the raid, which he described as an overreach of executive power by parliamentary authorities. After two hours they left with a piece of fabric of bearing the Portcullis House insignia, which Duffy said he had bought off the internet, and a plastic sign bearing the name of the former Brexit secretary David Davis, which he said he had retrieved from a bin. In a statement the Metropolitan police confirmed: 'No criminal offences were discovered and the case was closed.''I just feel absolutely relieved. It has been exhausting,'said Duffy, whose images of May, Bercow and others captured the highly charged exchanges of the last two years in parliament and were dubbed 'accidental renaissance'for their composition. Duffy was sacked from his post in September after clashing with his employers for allegedly bringing parliament into disrepute over social media posts and use of abstract images linked to Westminster in an art exhibition. He believes one post that caused consternation was a photo he took of a line of phallus-like shadows cast on Westminster Bridge by the trefoil shaped holes in the guard wall. It is an image that has appeared in national newspapers and tourist guides as a quirky feature of the bridge at certain times of day. Duffy claimed last year's report by Dame Laura Cox into allegations of bullying and harassment in parliament was 'spot on'but was being acted on in an 'a la carte'way instead of leading to a 'root and branch'review.

No 10: UK aim is to 'restore independence' from EU by end of year,0,Neutral,"Britain's main goal in trade talks with the EU will be to 'restore economic and political independence from 1 January'ù, No 10 has said, as the government prepares to publish its negotiating aims on Thursday. Boris Johnson's official spokesman said the 'primary objective'was ending the transition period by the end of the year, regardless of whether a deal had been struck. His comments suggest the UK will be prepared to walk away from talks rather than submit to the EU's requests for some oversight by the European court of justice (ECJ) and future alignment on regulation. The UK has said it will push for a Canada-style trade deal but appears to be prioritising the freedom to set its own rules rather than achieving such an agreement, if the EU insists on more alignment than it has with Canada. The negotiating aims are expected to be signed off by the 'XS'committee - including Johnson, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary - on Tuesday after an earlier cabinet meeting. The EU's negotiating priorities are due to be published on Tuesday after a meeting of the EU general affairs council and Monday's meeting of ambassadors. Johnson has been warned that the French government will not be blackmailed into a trade deal that risks France's long-term economic interests, as the EU prepared to further harden its negotiating position. No 10's latest statement of intent echoes remarks made last week by David Frost, the UK's chief negotiator with the EU. In a speech, he claimed the democratic consent of the British public would 'snap dramatically and finally'if the UK continued to be tied to EU rules. Frost said No 10 was not engaging in game-playing by rejecting alignment with EU laws after 2020 and insisted that the ability to break free from the EU's rulebook was essential to the purpose of Brexit. 'We are not looking for anything special,'he said in the speech. Frost, a former ambassador to Denmark, went on to reject suggestions that the ECJ would supervise any 'level playing field'conditions designed to ensure that neither side undercuts the other. He also said the UK would not take part in any EU programmes or agencies that put the country under the jurisdiction of the EU court. 'We bring to the negotiations not some clever tactical positioning but the fundamentals of what it means to be an independent country,'Frost said. 'It is central to our vision that we must have the ability to set laws that suit us - to claim the right that every other non-EU country in the world has.'A senior government source said No 10's 'red line'was avoiding any oversight from the ECJ and rejecting alignment of regulations with Brussels. 'Our overriding objective in the negotiations is by 1 January to have taken back control and we won't agree to anything that doesn't deliver that. Which means no rule-taking from the EU and no role for the European Court of Justice,'the source said. 'Our red line is we have to have taken back full control by 1 January '¶ Independence and fully taking back control is the priority. We want to do that through a Canada FTA (free trade agreement) but ultimately our priority is taking back control.' ",0.25,Positive
Music industry fears bands will be unable to tour UK without visas,-1.625,Negative,"The music industry has urged the government to clarify its proposed immigration rules amid fears that bands from the EU will not be able to tour the UK without written permission or a visa. They are the latest to warn of the economic risks posed by the new immigration rules which have already drawn criticism from the agriculture, hospitality and social care sectors. Deborah Annetts, the chief executive of the Incorporated Society of Musicians, said the policy paper published on Tuesday night did not offer the pledges it had sought to allow EU bands to enter the country freely for gigs post-Brexit. The paper suggests performers will need advance permission 'at the very least'ù, she claimed. The Home Office spokesman denied this was the case. 'The UK attracts world-class artists, entertainers and musicians and that's not going to change under the new system,'he said. 'The rules already permit performers from around the world to take part in events, concerts and competitions without the need for formal sponsorship or a work visa and that will continue to be the case.' The issue stems from paragraphs 21 and 25 in the paper. Annetts is concerned that paragraph 21 suggests a visa will be required while paragraph 25 seems to be a summary of existing rules that require non-EU citizens to get permission before performing in the UK. The Home Office points to paragraph 25 as the relevant section for musicians which states performers are allowed entry without a visa for up to six months and 'can receive payment for appearances at certain festivals or for up to a month for a specific engagement, without the need for formal sponsorship or a work visa'ù. Annetts says this is 'a misrepresentation'of the current visa arrangements for non-EU citizens as those who want to come up to a month have to get what is known as a permitted paid engagement visa which requires an advance engagement letter. 'To get into the country for 30 days as a musician from the EU as from January 2021 you will at the very least need a letter of engagement,'she said. 'It is not at all clear what type of organisation is qualified to give such a letter. And you will need supporting documents such as bank statements. Neither of these are required for EU musicians at the moment.'How it works  Bulgarian welder, holds A-level equivalent, has job offer for £26,000 a year, does not speak English.

The Home Office said it was 'maintaining the generous provisions for visitors, which include the provisions for artists, entertainers and musicians'and that the UK's existing visitor rules permit artists, entertainers and musicians to perform at events and take part in competitions and auditions for up to six months. The post-Brexit policy outlined by the government will form the foundation of an immigration bill, which is expected to easily pass through the House of Commons on account of the Conservative party's 80-strong majority. However, the Home Office is still going to consult on exemptions that will form a shortage occupation list and the music sector leaders hopes clarity will also emerge for the creative industries. Annetts said: 'This landed like a bombshell on Wednesday. We had been into the Home Office explaining to them that touring is not the same as immigration and they didn't really get it. We have also been to the department of culture, media and sport and they do absolutely get it. 'Touring is the lifeblood of the industry and if we don't have an exemption it is at risk.' The music industry is worth £111bn a year, as much as the construction industry, and Annetts is worried the government is not taking it seriously enough. 'We have been making the point very strongly that the Home Office has totally ignored this as far as we can see.'",0,Neutral
UK's expensive visa fees 'could deter NHS staff and scientists',0.5,Positive,"The UK's 'sky-high'visa fees could deter vital NHS staff and the 'brightest and best'scientists that Boris Johnson wants to attract with his new immigration policy, experts have warned. Nurses, lab technicians, engineers and tech experts who currently flock to the UK from the EU may not be able to afford to do so if the prime minister's proposed immigration overhaul becomes law. At £1,220 per person, or £900 for those on the shortage occupation list, the fees are among the highest in the world - and this is before charges for using the NHS and costs for sponsoring employers are taken into account. Comparisons with fee structures in other countries, published by the Institute for Government (IfG) thinktank, show that a family of five with a five-year work visa for one individual would have to pay £21,299 before they could enter in the country. This includes the annual £400 health surcharge that must also be paid upfront per person. This is double the fee charged by Australia and about 30 times the amount charged by Canada, where it costs just over £10,000 for a family for five years. Germany charges £756 for entry for a family of that size. The fee comparisons are equally stark for individuals. A single person who wants to come to the country will be charged up to £3,220 for five years. If they want to move to the UK with a spouse, the cost would rise to £6,500 for a five-year work stint. This compares with Canada, which charges £220 for an individual visa for three years; Germany, which charges £147; and France, which charges £2,075, according to the data supplied to the IfG. Luxembourg charges £50 (£42) for a visa and£80 for a residents permit. Lisa Roberts, an immigration lawyer at DLA Piper, said: 'The UK fees are sky high. With this sort of outlay, are you going to attract the Spanish nurse or are they going to go to Germany which doesn't charge anything?'The government announced on Tuesday it was closing British borders to unskilled migrants who do not speak English and scrapping the cap on skilled migrants, marking the biggest shakeup of immigration laws for 40 years. It means EU citizens seeking to work in the UK after January 2021 must also pay a minimum of £1,620 for the visa and the £400 health charge for one year. Roberts said the fees could be a barrier to many, including the lab technicians, engineers and scientists on an entry-level salary of between £20,480 (the new floor for immigrants) and £25,000. 'It's a question of whether the government wants to attract the 'òbest and the brightest' or just those with the deepest pockets,'she said. 'The fees are incredibly high and could be a big deterrent, especially for those who are looking at a range of countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg to relocate to, where the values and the lifestyle are similar.'Data from the Office for National Statistics shows many key occupations pay between £25,600 - the proposed salary threshold for entry to the UK - and £30,000, including teachers, science technicians and chemical process operatives. The government said the changes to the system were designed to reduce the overall levels of migration and give top priority to those with the 'highest skills and the greatest talents'ù. In IfG's report on immigration after Brexit, which was published last year, the thinktank says there is not enough debate about visa fees in parliament. 'It could be that the purpose of such high costs is to put applicants off, as a deliberate Home Office policy to minimise the number who seek to become UK citizens and make it easiest for wealthy people,'it says. 'But if it is part of a public administration decision, that the system should pay for itself, then there has been too little discussion about the consequences of following that path.'The immigration policy will place greater burdens on employers who rely on EU staff. They they will now incur visa fees, just as workers from third countries do. From January this will include a skills-charge fee of £1,000 per person, an employer visa fee of £610 for a visa up to three years, as well as £1,220 for a visa of more than three years, along with a £199 certificate of sponsorship. A Home Office spokesperson said fees were set at a level to provide the resources needed for border control but that a new fast track system would be introduced with 'reduced fees for certain medical professionals'ù. A spokesman said: 'In fairness to UK taxpayers, it is only right that those who directly benefit from our immigration system contribute to its funding.' ",0,Neutral
The starting gun has fired on Brexit trade talks - and we're already running out of time,0,Neutral,"As the UK and EU gear up for intensive trade negotiations in March, the temperature is already rising. Just this week Boris Johnson's most senior Europe adviser and lead negotiator, David Frost, delivered an unflinching message to his EU counterparts. Echoing previous statements by cabinet ministers such as Michael Gove and former chancellor Sajid Javid, Frost reiterated the government's unwillingness to be bound by EU labour, social, environmental and fiscal norms in the future, even as the EU insists this will be the price for the kind of trade deal - zero tariffs, zero quotas - the government seeks. And today, home secretary Priti Patel has fleshed out plans for a new immigration regime that will come into effect at the end of this year, when free movement of labour ends. At its heart, the system is designed to significantly reduce low-skilled immigration from the EU (by 140,000 per year). There is even chatter in Whitehall circles of introducing a fingerprint system for EU workers in the future. This comes on top of a robust No 10 media operation, which claimed yesterday that the EU's demands on regulatory alignment reflect a backtracking of promises it made to negotiate a 'Canada-style'free trade agreement. In fact, the EU hasn't backtracked: it always argued that Canada-style levels of market access would require stricter adherence to EU regulations than those applied to Canada. These substantive gaps between the two sides were to be expected at this stage of negotiations. The problem is that they will be aggravated by two related factors: the limited time available to do the deal, as well as the EU's lack of focus and its competing priorities. Both increase the risk of a bad deal, or of no deal whatsoever. The time constraint primarily flows from Johnson's unwillingness to extend the transition period beyond this year. The most important reason for this is the government's desire to loudly signal it has 'taken back control'ù. Another reason is money. Any extension to the transition period would mean continued UK contributions to the EU budget, as the £39bn payment negotiated as part of the UK's exit package only covers the government until the end of this year. The optics of negotiating how many more billions to send to Brussels wouldn't be easy for Johnson, regardless of the 80-seat majority he now commands. The UK's unwillingness to extend the transition suggests that the government has 10 months - from March to December - to strike a deal. In fact, the window will be much tighter: probably four months, from July to October. This is because whatever deal is negotiated will require ratification at the end of the year. Even if member states' national parliaments don't have to sign off on the initial deal, there will still be an approval process that involves EU leaders, the European parliament and the House of Commons which will eat up quite some time. Then there is the problem of focus - or lack thereof. The EU is currently in the process of finalising the negotiating mandate that will inform its position in the upcoming talks. But EU capitals haven't been able to agree among themselves what their negotiating priorities should be. Some member states want to focus on goods and fish; others on social security, aviation, data, security and foreign policy as well. That means there will be a substantial number of parallel tracks at the outset - some well-placed officials suggest 10-15 being negotiated at the same time. With little focus, senior EU officials worry that only limited progress will be made. This diluted negotiating process will only be rectified on 18-19 June, when EU leaders meet in Brussels to take stock of negotiations. It's at this point that they will have a reckoning with reality, and probably agree to focus their discussions on a few key areas - trade in goods and the governance framework for UK-EU relations being the most likely candidates. But four important months will have been lost. The final problem, which is outside the government's control but should have been factored into its thinking, concerns EU politics. Senior EU officials are currently trying to agree the union's budget blueprint and spending priorities through to 2028. EU leaders will meet in Brussels tomorrow to try and thrash out a deal. But they remain far apart, so agreement is only likely closer to summer or in the second half of the year. This is where leaders' time, energy and political capital will be spent. The EU will also be attempting to negotiate more stringent 2030 climate targets, a mini-trade deal with the US, host a summit with China, and advance its plans for 'digital sovereignty'ù. Trade talks with the UK, while important, are a distraction - 'a pain in the neck'ù, in the words of one of the EU principals who will be on the frontlines in the negotiations. As Germany will chair the EU's presidency from July to December, when the deal will have to be done, senior UK officials were hoping that Angela Merkel would use Berlin's influence in Brussels to force a degree of pragmatism into the EU's negotiating position. But with the resignation of her preferred successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Merkel's political standing and authority have been dented, and her ability to meaningfully influence the outcome of UK-EU talks seriously compromised. Gaps in policy, limited time, a lack of focus and a distracted EU paint a daunting picture as negotiators embark on a process to define the future relationship. The omens don't look promising.

The Guardian view on Europe after Brexit: unity is strength,1,Positive,"These are strange and somewhat disorientating times for the European Union. A multipolar world in which China's influence grows, and Donald Trump's United States is at best an erratic ally, has created new dilemmas and dangers. Closer to home, Brexit, whatever eventual form it takes, is already transforming the political landscape. For the 27 remaining EU member states, life without Britain truly begins this week. And the first problem to be solved is money. At a special summit on Thursday, called by the new European council president Charles Michel, discussions will begin in earnest over the shape of the EU budget from 2021 to 2027. They will be conducted in the absence of one of the biggest contributors to the collective pot. Taking place every seven years, these negotiations are fraught at the best of times; this round is likely to be the most difficult in the EU's history. Its progress will provide a litmus test of the union's ability to fashion a successful, confident strategy in challenging circumstances. The loss of the UK's annual contributions has left Brussels with a financial shortfall of around £62bn. In stark terms, that means that each country will have to pay more into the pot in future. The questions of how much more, and on what, have already become the source of divisions which could deepen existing antagonisms between east and west and north and south. A so-called 'frugal'faction, represented by prosperous countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden, is calling for the budget to be capped at 1% of EU gross national income, with a new spending emphasis on areas such as tech innovation and migration. The richer countries are also resisting calls by Mr Michel to phase out rebates to the largest net contributors to the budget. Poorer member states are demanding more money and more focus on traditional goals such as regional development and agricultural subsidies. Crucially, the rise of nationalist politics is informing both sides of the argument: Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orb√°n, for example, presents regional redistribution of European funds to the east as just compensation for multinational profits routinely funnelled back to the west; in the more well-heeled corners of Europe, the popularity of far-right parties such as the Sweden Democrats and the FvD in the Netherlands fuels the calls for slimmed-down payments to the union's poorer relations. In one position paper, the 'frugals'warn that 'placing an ever-increasing financial burden on a small number of member states will not be acceptable to our citizens'ù. In normal times, Germany could be expected to act as an anchor of stability amid such turbulent waters. But Angela Merkel's government also finds itself looking over its shoulder at nationalists. Last week Mrs Merkel's successor as chair of the CDU, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, stepped down, ushering in a period of unpredictable transition on the German right. Her resignation followed a decision by CDU politicians in the eastern state of Thuringia to break the taboo on forming alliances with the far-right Eurosceptic party Alternativ f√ºr Deutschland (AfD). Chancellor Merkel has already announced her intention not to stand for office again in elections due in 2021, although that contest might now come sooner. As it seeks to elect a new leader, the CDU thus faces its own period of soul-searching on whether it should tack to the nationalist right in order to see off the AfD threat. The world needs a flourishing EU which can unite around common goals. Among the subjects up for discussion, for example, in this week's summit, is the £100bn 'green deal'designed to subsidise less wealthy member states on the path to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It would be lamentable if this initiative succumbed to a new politics of division. In the age of Trump and the rise of China, it also falls to Europe to make the case for economic cooperation and compromise and lead the way on issues such as human rights and digital privacy. For the EU, life without Britain begins in earnest tomorrow. And the stakes could not be higher. ",0,Neutral
Ireland reunited and the dissolution of the UK?,0,Neutral,"Martin Kettle is right to draw attention to the risk that a narrow victory for reunification in any Northern Irish border poll would not be accepted by sections of the unionist community (The success of Sinn FÈin surely brings the UK's breakup nearer, Journal, 13 February). But he is wrong if he thinks that such a poll is imminent. The secretary of state for Northern Ireland can initiate a border referendum only if 'at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland'ù. The opinion poll carried out by Lord Ashcroft suggests that 46% of voters favour reunification, while 45% do not. Does this mean it 'appears likely'that voters would support reunification? No, it does not. It is possible they might, but it is more than possible they might not, once the undecided are added in. A reasonable interpretation of the legislation would therefore be that the secretary of state must hold a referendum once the opinion polls consistently show a significantly higher level of support for reunification than against. A 60/40 split would be the right sort of indicator, not least because it would show cross community support. But until then all parties should focus on making devolved government in Belfast a success. Risking a civil war in Northern Ireland is in no one's interest. Alan BoyleEmeritus professor of public international law, University of Edinburgh '¢ Martin Kettle warns that Brexit combined with Sinn FÈin's success in the Irish election could lead to the breakup of the UK. This may well be true, but if so, where is the downside for this English nationalist Tory government? Northern Ireland is a historic economic and political burden which few English Tories would really miss. Reunification of Ireland also removes a complex problem in England's dealings with its neighbours. Meanwhile, Scotland is probably lost for ever to the Tories but might conceivably return more Labour MPs in the future, putting Tory hegemony at risk. So Scottish independence would probably lock in a permanent Tory majority in the rump UK. Given the Tories' ruthless determination to pursue damaging ideological goals at any cost in order to secure power, why would they balk at this?Chris WebsterG√ºmligen, Switzerland '¢ The crux of Brexit was always the resolution to the border problem between the UK and Ireland. Rather than the backstop, Boris Johnson reverted back to the original EU proposal of a border in the Irish Sea (which Theresa May felt no British prime minister could ever accept). Benign neglect seems to be creating an economic union on the island of Ireland with the policy of increased friction and border controls. Seeming to have not given much thought to any wider implications, physical proximity will surely lead to, ironically, ever closer union as a result of the government's mantra of getting Brexit done. To add to the saga of indifference, we see another Northern Ireland secretary replaced for no discernible reason beyond prime ministerial pique. It has been hard to see any convincing strategic thinking by any Brexiter on the future of the union since 2016.

Portugal considers subsidising UK tourists' post-Brexit healthcare,0,Neutral,"ÔªøPortugal is considering offering British tourists subsidised post-Brexit healthcare in an effort to retain their custom in the Algarve, Lisbon and beyond. It is one of several novel measures being considered by the Portuguese government in an effort to minimise the disruption of Brexit to its economy. Rita Marques, the tourism minister, said the country was examining a unilateral offer to ensure cover offered by the European health insurance card (Ehic), the EU reciprocal system, can continue if a deal is not struck on it during this year's trade talks. She said: 'The Portuguese and the UK are the oldest allies in the world and no matter what happens the Portuguese will stand by the British. The British traveller is very important to us. 'We are looking to guarantee this health cover next year. We are currently looking at how often it is used and if it is making a positive impact. We are in the process of testing this and the other ideas right now. 'If these are issues that are important to the British traveller, then we have to go for it. We are trying to minimise the disruption to British tourism.'About 2 million Britons visit Portugal every year. The latest figures show the Algarve is the No 1 destination with 1.2 million British tourists in 2019. Among the other measures Portugal were considering, said Marques, were dedicated passport lanes for British visitors, special arrangements to continue to recognise British driving licences and entry for British pets. But the potential to offer replacement healthcare cover when the Ehic ceases to apply to British residents from January next year is the most dramatic and potentially costly intervention the government is considering. 'The idea is you would pay the same as a Portuguese person, which is a small tax to see the GP or to visit a hospital,'Marques said, adding that it would involve agreements with both state and private hospitals. Unlike the UK, many countries charge a set fee for GP and A&E visits. This co-payment would still apply to British tourists in Portugal where it costs between £14 (£11.70) and £18 for emergency medical service, and between £9 and £45 for a consultation with a GP or health centre. The Ehic grants EU citizens access to free or reduced-cost healthcare while on holiday in the EU and the European Economic Area, and pays for 250,000 medical treatments of British tourists each year, according to a House of Commons research briefing. However, unless a deal is agreed to continue with the Ehic system, the cover for Britons will disappear on 1 January 2021 when the Brexit transition period ends. Continuing with the health card may be a price worth paying to keep British tourists, who contribute £3bn - or about 1.5% - to the overall Portuguese economy of £204bn. Statistics show 17% of tourist receipts come from British tourists, with the number of overnight stays among Britons up almost 8% compared with 1.3% for tourism as a whole. Last year's Brelcome campaign, advertising the country's 850km (530-mile) coastline, food and sunshine, helped reverse a 2018 decrease in British tourist numbers after a six-year boom.

Last British member of European court of justice could sue EU,0,Neutral,"The last British member of the European court of justice has said she could sue the EU over an attempt by the bloc's 27 member states to force her out. Eleanor Sharpston, who is an advocate general to the court in Luxembourg, is set to be replaced by a Greek candidate because of Brexit. Asked whether she might take the EU to the court of justice over her removal, Sharpston said she was considering her case. 'I have not made up my mind,'she told the Law Gazette. 'It may be that the very last service I can render to my court is to see whether there is something I can do to push back against the member states intruding into the court's autonomy and independence.'Shortly before the UK's withdrawal from the EU, the member states stated that the mandates of all UK-related members of the bloc's institutions would automatically end on 31 January. Sharpston, whose mandate will end in October 2021, has been told that she will only remain in post until her replacement has been appointed. The number of advocates general, who advise the court's judges, remains fixed at 11. The EU member states' position in relation to Sharpston's tenure is said to be legally doubtful. The court's statute states the mandate of a serving member can only be terminated for disciplinary reasons, by the court acting unanimously. Sharpston, a fellow of King's College, Cambridge, and a former joint head of chambers in London, has been at the ECJ since 2006. The court's British judge, Christopher Vajda, has already lost his seat despite the UK remaining within the single market and customs union until the end of 2020. There are 27 judges sitting on the ECJ - one for every member state. Vajda, who would otherwise have stayed a judge on the court until 2024, told the Law Gazette it was a pity the British government could not retain representation through the so-called transition period.  'The UK had a very weak hand,'he said. ",-0.375,Negative
The drive for Scottish independence is distinct from nationalism,0,Neutral,"Rafael Behr makes many valid points, and correctly describes the risks of nationalism going sour (Nationalism is winning - on both sides of the border, Journal, 12 February). But he confuses support for independence with nationalism. It is nothing to do with nationalism that makes a growing number of us want to see an independent government at Holyrood - where Scottish legislators, who sit in a semi-circle chamber conducive to compromise, are elected through a system of proportional representation which was designed to check the extremists of any one party (nationalist or otherwise), and which allows more of the electorate to feel that they have a stake in government. Compare that with the adversarial, childish jeering and mayhem that passes for legislative debate in Westminster's chamber, where an absurd winner-takes-all voting system leaves millions unrepresented. Westminster is not the enemy, it is an anachronism. It is not a case of 'nationalists rewriting the past'- it is about wanting to move forward from the past. Not in search of utopia, but in search of the greater self-respect that will come from being governed under a democratic system fit for the 21st century.Julie DarlingRosewell, Midlothian '¢ Towards the end of Rafael Behr's article, he suggests that nationalism ultimately 'taps the rage of fanatics'ù. The reason I vote SNP has nothing to do with any latent fanaticism. It has more to do with the long-standing democratic deficit in Scotland. I voted Labour throughout the Tory years of Thatcher and Major. In 1997, we finally got a New Labour government, only to be disappointed by its continuation of Thatcherism, admittedly by more humane means. The SNP is a left-of-centre party, anti-Trident and steadfastly opposed to any privatisations of our NHS. As such, it responds to the aspirations of Scottish people. I agree with Rafael Behr that nationalism has nasty connotations. Nicola Sturgeon herself has admitted as much. For that reason, I value the actor Brian Cox's recent suggestion that the Scottish National party should rebrand itself as the Scottish Independence party. If that was the case, SNP supporters would not have to fend off misunderstandings about what it is they stand for.Alastair McLeishEdinburgh '¢ A good deal of the support for Scottish independence is much more pragmatic and mundane than Rafael Behr seems to think. For geographical, historical and cultural reasons, Scotland - like Norway, Denmark, Iceland and Finland - feels like a distinct political entity, and it seems to make sense that it should run its own affairs. No fanaticism in this position and 'atavism'is confined to small cliques of tartan reactionaries. Incomers will continue to be welcome, existing ties will be maintained and borders will be as near invisible as they can be. For the left, including the Greens (the actual Greens, not the caricature offered by Behr), there are two additional advantages to Scottish independence. First, it would probably lead to the UK losing its UN security council seat and hence its anachronistic great power delusions. And second, the loss of Faslane would probably lead to the end of the UK's so-called nuclear deterrent. This is not a nationalist but a post-imperialist project.Richard MiddletonCastle Douglas, Kirkcudbrightshire '¢ Notwithstanding Rafael Behr's wise words about the dangers of nationalism, he misses a significant difference between English and Scottish versions. English nationalism appears to be pursuing an illusory sovereignty. By contrast, Scottish aspirations are increasingly focused on establishing Scotland as a member state within a European Union that more broadly shares its values and concerns. More national interest than nationalism perhaps.Brian CaddickDinder, Somerset '¢ Please recognise that Scotland is a different country from England in its values and future, differences that have been compounded by Brexit. It is not nationalism that is driving a wish for independence in Scotland but, rather, the realisation that it is closer to Scandinavia than England in its potential and culture.

McDonnell and Starmer show split on Labour's Brexit stance,0,Neutral,"A sharp split has emerged between the two chief architects of Labour's Brexit policy as John McDonnell and Keir Starmer delivered vastly different verdicts on how their strategy affected the party's performance in December's general election. McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, who is said to have convinced Jeremy Corbyn to back a second referendum, said in an exclusive interview before the budget that the party had been caught in a 'vice'trying to please voters and members. The Tories had a simple message that was 'unchallengable'ù, he suggested. Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said in a separate interview that their policy was right and it was not the sole reason the party suffered its worst election defeat since 1935. McDonnell's intervention is the first time he has given such a frank assessment on the policy he helped devise and how it may have ultimately hit Labour at the ballot box. He said the party should now drop the issue for a generation and accept that Brexit was happening. 'The reality now is Brexit is going to happen. It's can we get a Brexit that at least protects jobs and the economy. And can we establish a new relationship with Europe,'he said. McDonnell will retire to the backbenches when a new Labour leader is elected, and one of his first jobs then will be to establish connections with socialist parties in the EU to see how they can agree a policy programme for the future of the left in Europe without Britain in the EU. Days before voters went to the polls, McDonnell said he thought Labour's plan would stop Brexit supporters flocking to the Tories. He claimed the party would negotiate a 'credible and sensible'withdrawal agreement with the EU within three months of forming a government, and then put that deal to a referendum within six months. In that scenario he would have campaigned for remain, and he was part of a powerful clique in the shadow cabinet alongside Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, and Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary. However, he admitted in his interview: 'You can't buck democracy.'McDonnell said: 'We were caught in a vice. And the vice was between do we go for a full remain and lose more leave seats, or do we go for full leave and lose remain seats?'He suggested the party would have succumbed to a 150-seat Tory majority had it not struck upon a policy that straddled both viewpoints. He claimed the party managed to pull back votes from the Liberal Democrats while attempting to retain Labour leave voters with stronger policies on NHS funding. The Tory majority in the end was 80. McDonnell said it was not possible to tell for certain whether advocating for a stronger leave position would have produced a different outcome. 'If people think that's their number one issue, what better can you offer them than that hard simple message from the Tories and the Brexit party, which was unchallengeable in that sense,'he said. On Sunday Starmer confidently backed the policy he helped negotiate and said he would have gone further and pushed the leadership to tell members which side they would campaign for. Asked on the Sophy Ridge on Sunday show on Sky News if it was the right policy, Starmer said: 'Of course.'He said: 'I thought it was the right policy. I thought we should have gone on by the way and said which side we would be campaigning on if there was a referendum and I warned our party that if we looked indecisive, we wouldn't look like we were leading on this issue.'He said going into an election saying Labour would try to get another deal was the right thing to do because Boris Johnson's proposals 'would be very damaging for our country'ù. Other members of the shadow cabinet have said since the election defeat that they repeatedly warned the party not to back another referendum on Brexit and to lean more towards their leave-supporting voters. The shadow cabinet secretary, Jon Trickett, said the policy was a mistake while the party chair, Ian Lavery, said Labour ended up trying to 'foist'a remain position on working-class communities. Starmer said Brexit was only one of several reasons for Labour's election loss. He said: 'I think we all take responsibility for that devastating election loss. People brought up the leadership of the Labour party, fairly or unfairly; they brought up Brexit in different ways - what was said in the Midlands was different to what was said here in Scotland; they brought up the fact that they thought the manifesto was overloaded and they didn't believe we could deliver it all; and in a number of places they brought up antisemitism.'Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey are through to the final stage of the Labour leadership contest, where members are balloted on whom they want to succeed Corbyn.

òFighting like ferrets in a bag' as EU tries to plug Brexit cash hole,0,Neutral,"Presidents, prime ministers and chancellors across Europe will pack their bags later this week in preparation for a long weekend in Brussels. They won't, however, be taking in the baroque majesty of the Grand Place or savouring the local culinary treats. Instead, they will be preparing for that most infamous of events, a 'four shirter'ù, to use the clothes-packing gauge adopted by male diplomats to measure the length and horror of EU leaders' summits in the Belgian capital. The thorny subject this time around? Money. And the problem? Britain. The UK's withdrawal from the European Union has left a huge £75bn (£62bn) hole in the bloc's budget for the next seven years, 2021 to 2027. 'And now we are fighting like ferrets in a sack,'said one EU diplomat with a sigh. Covering items ranging from agricultural subsidies to science programmes and the EU's efforts to combat the climate emergency, the new multi-annual financial framework (MFF) needs to be agreed by the leaders and an increasingly unpredictable European parliament before the end of the year. Without agreement, everything risks grinding to a halt in just nine months' time, including the flow of cohesion funds, the cash dedicated to supporting the poorest member states. Budget discussions in Brussels are always rancorous affairs. But this one is of a different order: everyone will have to pay more. No one wants to. EU capitals are bristling for a fight when they come to Brussels on Thursday for day one. Ominously for the diplomatic corps, an end date for the summit has not been fixed, but four days of talking are on the cards. There are two main rivals in the budget battle. On one side are those who proudly describe themselves as 'the Frugals'- the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark (although there are some concerns within the camp that the new Austrian coalition government, being a bit Green now, has been lost to them, and that the Swedes are going soft). As the biggest net payers, the Frugals have been insisting on a budget of no more than 1% of the EU's gross national income. The European commission's initial proposal was for 1.1% - around £1.25tn over the seven years. Then there are the 'Friends of Cohesion'ù. 'The Friends of Corruption, you mean?'spat one EU diplomat from a Frugal state. The 15 under the FoC flag are the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Estonia, Croatia, Malta, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania, Portugal and Greece. The Frugals say that the commission's £90bn in cuts to agriculture and cohesion funding are not enough. The FoC say they are being unfairly targeted and that the richer countries should cough up some more, setting up a battle between east and west. The debate is all the more toxic as the commission has proposed that cohesion funds should also, in the future, be conditional on member states respecting the rule of law. It is a red rag to the bulls in the nationalist governments of Hungary and Poland, who are already in a battle with Brussels over their judicial reforms, among other issues. Then there is France and Germany. Berlin's main concern is that they don't come out of it looking worse than the French. In Paris, the government just worries about how much cash is going to go to its farmers, said one senior EU official. The fragmentation of the national debates leaves it impossible to say what will happen, said a second official, with even Irish politics in turmoil following the election that has made Sinn FÈin the second largest parliamentary party. Going in to the summit, the European council's president, Charles Michel, a former prime minister of Belgium, has been engaged in furious shuttle diplomacy around the capitals. Michel has put forward an alternative proposal for the budget to be 1.074% of the bloc's gross national income (£1.094tn) in an attempt to split the difference between the warring camps. 'In this negotiation, we are not expecting member states to be happy, but the degree of dissatisfaction will be key,'said a senior EU official. 'No chance,'responded a Frugal diplomat. 'There is not a lot to say, except we won't pay. And as the Rolling Stones song goes, 'òTime is on my side'.'",-0.5,Negative
The Observer view on Boris Johnson's cabinet reshuffle,0,Neutral,"Britain faces the most challenging period of its recent history. It has simultaneously to reshape its place in the international order, wholly remake its trading relationships, recast its economy and forge a new settlement between north and south, all within a few years. Yet the government that purports to be ready to meet these challenges is populated by some of the weakest political and governing talent for generations. When the dust had settled on Boris Johnson's cabinet reshuffle , the overriding impression was that conformity to Number 10's Brexit-framed diktat, in particular to the prejudices of his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is more prized than ability, however much Downing Street may protest that its ambition is delivery of 'the people's priorities'ù. The country and the Conservative party will be fatally ill-served. Brexit is the alpha and omega of this government, even if it wishes to expunge the word from the political vocabulary. The tensions surrounding Brexit had become crystallised in the dysfunctional, poisonous relationship that had developed between Sajid Javid and Number 10 and which manifested itself in the one-hour showdown between prime minister and chancellor last Thursday that led to the latter's resignation after only seven months in office. No self-respecting minister, said Javid afterwards, could accept the demand that he sack five advisers for them to be replaced by Number 10's nominees - answering to Dominic Cummings and not to the chancellor. His replacement, Rishi Sunak, has had to accept the office on the terms Javid refused and is thus surrounded by a team who report to a stronger power centre. This arrangement would be impossible in a charity shop, let alone the second most important office in the land. The reason for the coup is that Downing Street cannot accept the economic and political realities and policy consequences as relayed to them by the Treasury, which is keenly aware of two profoundly troubling economic facts. The first is that, despite the prime minister's upbeat language, the immediate economic prospects are dire and demand extreme circumspection in how the economy is managed. Stagnating tax revenues do not provide the platform for the kind of public expenditure increases sought by Johnson and Cummings as they aim to level up north and south, unless the aim to limit borrowing only for capital expenditure is abandoned. Javid had aimed to balance current day-to-day spending and revenues by 2023, with even that pledge demanding tax increases, given poor growth prospects. It was not a message Number 10 could accept, with Johnson wanting to 'ping off the guy ropes of self-doubt and negativity'ù. The Treasury's world view was that of recalcitrant Remoaners. The second is that the Treasury knows dire economic forecasts are intertwined with the reluctance of overseas and domestic companies to commit major investment in the UK with the spectre of an ultra-hard or even no-deal Brexit. If this year's negotiations with the EU - crammed into a mere 10 months - end with Britain in effect having to trade with its overwhelmingly biggest trading partner on or close to unprivileged WTO terms, which senior ministers such as Michael Gove have floated as a real possibility about which the government is allegedly unconcerned, the economic implications are serious. There can only be a slowdown in exports to the EU, mirrored by an acceleration of imports, as well as a weakening in our vital surplus in financial services, because access to Europe's markets in services on current terms will be denied. This is why the overwhelming bulk of economic forecasters predict lower growth as a result of a hard Brexit. The Treasury wants to ameliorate this prospect by pressing for a framework trade agreement with the EU that preserves as much market access as possible, especially for the crucial financial services industry. Javid had been photographed going into Number 10 last Monday with a document making the case that Britain should push for 'permanent equivalence'in the regulatory financial regime between Britain and Europe. The Treasury seeks to protect a £69bn trade surplus in financial services, fundamental to sustaining overseas investors' confidence in sterling, especially as after Brexit Britain's trade deficit is bound to widen. But this implies Britain being a rule-taker and not 'taking back control'ù. To make this case to Johnson and Cummings is to betray Brexit. The Treasury's entire perspective - pushing for a comprehensive trade agreement, trying to safeguard the City and business while managing the economy cautiously given extreme economic weakness - is the antithesis of what Cummings and Johnson believe. The City is more than capable of looking after itself in a 'global Britain'ù, while the way through any short-term economic weakness is to spend, cut taxes and borrow - straight out of Donald Trump's economic playbook. Javid may have been willing to borrow for capital investment such as HS2, but that was not good enough. He had to be made to bend to Downing Street's will - or go. The necessity to follow through on all that a hard Brexit entails was at the heart of the reshuffle, and betrayed the motives behind the moves. The foreign and home secretaries - B team politicians but ultra-loyal to the government's direction of travel - kept their jobs while those replacing sacked ministers could be relied upon to do Number 10's bidding or help further centralise power. Thus, Suella Braverman's job as attorney general will be to weaken the courts' capacity to constrain government via judicial review, a process to be fundamentally reassessed, while new Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, will be required to make none of the independent moves initiated by his predecessor, Julian Smith, which secured the power-sharing government. The new cabinet is charged with taking the country through its greatest postwar challenge. The collective bet is that concerns about a hard or no-deal Brexit can be ignored as Remoaner gloom-mongering. Yet those concerns are very real and about to manifest themselves. Careless of all precautionary action, Number 10 is centralising power to ensure its will is met. The danger is inevitably that the government is set to founder on the rocks of Brexit. All of us are set to founder with it. ",0.125,Positive
Macron sets out 10-year vision for EU with call for more integration,0.125,Positive,"Europe's middle classes will only remain reconciled to the European Union if it becomes more integrated, with an effective defence policy, a larger budget and integrated capital markets, and is shorn of vetoes that slow decision-making, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has said. Setting out his 10-year vision for Europe on Saturday, Macron said he still wanted to see the UK involved in defence, but urged European countries to recognise that in terms of social welfare, Europe had different values to the US. The continent, he said, was reaching the hour of truth, the moment when it must decide about greater integration and commonality. He warned: 'If the Franco-German tandem do not come up with a perspective for the middle classes, that will be a historic failure.'Referring to the weakness of the west, Macron admitted he was impatient, if not frustrated, to hear a German response to his call for a strategic dialogue on a more integrated Europe. Asking for a clear answer, he said the countries 'have a history of waiting for answers'from each other. 'What's key in the coming years is to move much faster on issues of sovereignty on the European level,'he said. He expanded on his controversial call for Europe to open a strategic dialogue with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, saying the only way to end frozen conflicts, including the one in Ukraine, was for Europe to work with Russia. He insisted: 'My position is not pro-Russian or anti-Russian, it is pro-European.'In a reference to the US and the UK, he said: 'I hear the defiance of all our partners; I'm not mad, but I know that being defiant and weak '¶ is not a policy, it's a completely inefficient system. 'There is a second choice, which is to be demanding and restart a strategic dialogue, because today we talk less and less, conflicts multiply and we aren't able to resolve them.'Macron said that although the current policy of sanctions and counter-sanctions was not working, he did not advocate they be lifted in the context of Ukraine. He also said he doubted Russia had ended its direct and indirect interference in democratic elections, saying the best response was to defend Europe's networks and adding: 'I do not believe in miracles, but in policies.'Macron confirmed he was willing to lift French objections - he denied it was a veto - to opening EU membership talks with North Macedonia, so long as the EU agreed to the accession process becoming less teleological, long-winded and bureaucratic. The bloc's current review of its accession procedures should do away with the idea that progress to accession was not reversible, he said. Macron was speaking after two leading German politicians affirmed Germany needed to do more to respond to Macron's offer of dialogue. The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said: 'Germany is ready to get more involved, including militarily.'He called for the 'construction of a European security and defence union as a strong, European pillar of Nato'ù. Europe needed to respond, he said, due to the sudden emergence of a geo-strategic gap to which the continent had closed it eyes. He explained: 'The real gamechanger is that the era of omnipresent American global policemen is over. Everyone can see that. It is not due to US lack of military power, but to the commitment of those responsible in the White House.'Decisions on the Middle East were being taken by countries that did not share European values, he said. In Iraq, Libya, Ukraine and the Sahel, Europe 'should not cede these crises to those who bring weapons and mercenaries, not peace'ù, he added. The German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, on Friday warned that Donald Trump's 'America First'strategy had shaken up the international order and fuelled insecurity in an unstable world. 'We are witnessing today an increasingly destructive momentum in global politics,'Steinmeier said, adding: 'Every year we are getting further and further away from our goal of creating a more peaceful world through international cooperation. 'Under its current administration, the USA rejects the very concept of an international community. Every country, it believes, should look after itself and put its own interests before all others.'Steinmeier, whose role is largely ceremonial but serves as a moral compass for Germany, said Europe needed to take more control of its own security, including through higher military spending. 'Only a Europe that is able and willing to credibly protect itself, will keep the US in Nato,'he said.

New attorney general wants to 'take back control' from courts,0.125,Positive,"Suella Braverman, a passionate Brexiter who has threatened to 'take back control'from an interfering judiciary, is Boris Johnson's surprise appointment as attorney general - the government's most senior legal adviser. Two weeks ago, the MP for Fareham published a searing attack on human rights litigation and the overuse of judicial review challenges on the Conservative Home website; a political stance likely to have found favour with No 10 insiders. Born and raised in north-west London, Braverman's parents moved to the UK in the 1960s from Kenya and Mauritius. After studying law at Cambridge University, the Sorbonne and New York City University, the 39-year-old's professional and political advancement has been meteoric. Braverman trained as a barrister in London, specialising in planning, judicial review and immigration cases. She was appointed to the attorney general's Treasury panel and represented the government in hearings. She won her south coast constituency seat in 2015, campaigned for Brexit and briefly became chair of the European Research Group of pro-Brexit MPs. Rapidly promoted to ministerial positions, she began as parliamentary private secretary to Treasury ministers before becoming a junior minister at the former Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU), but resigned in November 2018 in protest at Theresa May's proposed deal. Braverman became embroiled in controversy early last year over her declaration that: 'As Conservatives, we are engaged in a battle against cultural Marxism.'She dismissed allegations that the phrase was an 'antisemitic trope'ù. The Board of Deputies of British Jews later said they had held discussions and described her as 'clearly a good friend of the Jewish community'ù. The Johnson loyalist told her local newspaper at the December election count that the result was 'a great endorsement of Boris Johnson's leadership - he's got a very authentic manner when it comes to campaigning'ù. As attorney general she will play a significant role in both the proposed royal commission on criminal justice and the more controversial constitution, democracy and rights commission which will examine the relationship between the courts and parliament. In her Conservative Home article last month, Braverman wrote: 'Restoring sovereignty to parliament after Brexit is one of the greatest prizes that awaits us. But not just from the EU. As we start this new chapter of our democratic story, our parliament must retrieve power ceded to another place - the courts '¶ The political has been captured by the legal. Decisions of an executive, legislative and democratic nature have been assumed by our courts. Prorogation and the triggering of article 50 were merely the latest examples of a chronic and steady encroachment by the judges. 'The catalyst for this proliferation [of judicial review challenges] was the Human Rights Act. Parliament's legitimacy is unrivalled and the reason why we must take back control, not just from the EU, but from the judiciary.'In what was clearly a disapproving tweet, the Secret Barrister commented: 'An entirely fitting attorney general for a Boris Johnson government.'The barrister and former Conservative MP Anna Soubry similarly tweeted: 'Genuine concern that as a hardline, no-deal Brexiteer with little experience [Braverman] will not undertake the important role of AG - which invariably means giving firm legal advice a Govt/PM doesn't want to hear because it doesn't suit them politically.'Commenting on her appointment, Braverman said: 'One of my first priorities is to continue the government's work in rebuilding confidence in our justice system, particularly with victims.'",0,Neutral
The Guardian view on a Brexit trade deal: tricky but not impossible,0,Neutral,"Size matters in trade talks, as the UK should have learned from the first phase of Brexit. But British Eurosceptics were slow to grasp the challenges faced by a lone member leaving the single market, when the rest of the European Union can negotiate en bloc. Now that the UK is a 'third country'ù, the balance of power has shifted further in favour of Brussels. British refusal to adapt is causing bemusement and consternation on the continent. Earlier this week, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, spoke dismissively of Boris Johnson's notion of an 'Australia-style'deal. She knows that this is a euphemism for no deal at all. Also this week, Michel Barnier warned that UK ministers 'kid themselves'if they think they can secure permanent, automatic access to EU financial services markets. Brussels decides which regimes enjoy regulatory 'equivalence'and retains the right to withdraw that status unilaterally. (That is a statement of the obvious, but what is obvious in Europe often sounds like a rebuke to Conservatives.) The Treasury says it does not seek a once-and-for-all equivalence deal, just something more durable than certification that Brussels can revoke with only 30-days' notice. In theory, that leaves plenty of room for a deal. In practice, the landing strip is narrow because the two sides come at the question of regulatory divergence with different concepts of what is being discussed. The British side sees only intransigence when Brussels is wary of making exceptions and granting privileges to its neighbour. In Boris Johnson's view, neighbours should do each other favours. The prime minister says he wants a close relationship and that he does not intend to undercut the EU on basic standards. The prime minister sees divergence as a symbolic right - vital for UK sovereignty, not something a European court can be allowed to enforce. Viewed from Brussels, Mr Johnson's statements of intent are worthless, and not just because he is known to have a loose relationship with the truth. They see beyond personality to the strategic nub, where divergence only has meaning as a device to carve out a competitive edge. That is the whole point of Brexit for its ideological architects. Once the decision was made to define national sovereignty as regulatory autarky, Britain set itself on a course of economic rivalry with the rest of the EU. The law cannot be fudged and the UK's proximity to the single market therefore makes a deal harder to strike, not easier as Mr Johnson claims. This reality has penetrated parts of the government. Michael Gove recently warned industry bodies to expect the return of wide-ranging border controls when the Brexit transition period ends in December. (The government no longer aims to minimise trade friction in the short term - and wants British businesses to pay for the downgrade in ambition.) On this trajectory Mr Johnson's government is heading towards trade with the EU on WTO terms, not because it thinks that is a good deal but because that is the purest expression of the prime minister's rhetoric. That might change as the negotiation gets under way. The EU has good reason to encourage the shift, finding creative ways to satisfy the UK appetite for regulatory autonomy in principle, but with mechanisms that keep a level playing field in practice. Mr Johnson has to swallow some pride, because size still matters, but there is a lesson for Brussels too. The UK is not Switzerland or Norway. No British government could sign up to economic satellite status. If there is a deal available, it will be unlike any arrangement with any other third country. The first step towards realising that ambition would be for Mr Johnson to move on from the pretence that the strategic intimacy of the old relationship can easily be replicated in a new one. It is possible, but only on terms that the Tory party does not yet understand. ",-0.5,Negative
"UK alignment on EU standards price to pay for trade deal, say MEPs",0,Neutral,"The European parliament has called on Michel Barnier to keep Britain permanently tied to its employment, environment and competition laws as the price for maintaining free trade with the EU. In a resolution adopted by 543 votes to 39, with 69 abstentions, MEPs said there needed to be 'dynamic alignment'with EU standards across a range of issues. As MEPs gave their seal of approval for the maximalist position, the European commission for the first time wielded its powers under the withdrawal agreement to order the British government to change its domestic law, despite the country having left the EU two weeks ago. Under the terms of the transition period, during which the UK stays in the single market and customs union but none of Brussels's decision-making institutions, EU law continues to be superior to UK national law. The government was given two months by the commission to amend a levy on heavy trucks on which UK-registered drivers can get a discount. The EU's executive branch said the levy discriminated against those based in member states. It highlights the uncomfortable position for the government for the next 11 months, during which the country will be in what Boris Johnson has previously described as a position of 'vassalage'ù. The resolution, passed by the European parliament on Wednesday, called for EU regulations to continue to set the standard for British lawmakers past 2020. MEPs said there was a need to avoid a 'race to the bottom'as they backed dynamic alignment of UK law with the EU's. The MEP Nathalie Loiseau, a former French minister for EU affairs and a member of the parliament's UK coordination group, said: 'The European parliament has proposed a broad, deep and sustainable partnership that is unprecedented in scope and ambition to the UK. 'This offer comes with balanced obligations: we will not compromise on what we stand for: high standards we have to protect consumers, workers, privacy and personal data of citizens or to protect the environment.'The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain's entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a 'deep-seated hostility'towards the European project. With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home. The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted ""yes"". Margaret Thatcher, later to be leader of the Conservative party, campaigned to remain. Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the ""iron lady"" marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand 'our own money back'claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back'despite being one of the 'three poorer'members of the community. It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.† Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in 'embryo'ù. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU. Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was 'òno, no, no' to what she saw as Delors' continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch's Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered 'Up yours Delors'front page. A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of 'a single market without barriers - visible or invisible - giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world's wealthiest and most prosperous people"". Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.† Tony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers' rights. Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. 'Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,'he said in his maiden speech. 'The level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.'Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro. EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club. Anti-immigration hysteria seems to take hold with references to 'cockroches'by Katie Hopkins in the Sun and tabloid headlines such as 'How many more can we take?'and 'Calais crisis: send in the dogs'ù. David Cameron returns from Brussels with an EU reform package - but it isn't enough to appease the Eurosceptic wing of his own party The UK votes to leave the European Union, triggering David Cameron's resignation and paving the way for Theresa May to become prime minister After years of parliamentary impasse during Theresa May's attempt to get a deal agreed, the UK leaves the EU. The resolution also urged Johnson to 'immediately clarify'his government's approach to the Irish border agreement, following his repeated claims that no checks would be required on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The MEPs sought to include gender equality in trade talks, with measures to combat the pay gap, and recommended the UK should not be a net beneficiary of any EU programmes, threatening Britain's research funding. The vote came as EU member states met in Brussels to further toughen up the negotiating mandate proposed by Barnier, their chief Brexit negotiator, ahead of negotiations with the UK next month. Under Barnier's opening proposal the UK would need to commit to non-regression from current environmental, social and workers standards and would be tied into upgrading its legislation in the field of competition policy and state subsidies as EU positions develop in the years to come. France is among the member states which believes the EU needs a tougher negotiating stance. Its final position will be adopted by member states on 25 February. ",0.25,Positive
British nationals working in Brussels snap up Irish passports,0,Neutral,"More than 50 British nationals working for the European commission in Brussels have obtained Irish passports, which can help secure career progression, it has emerged. Data released by the commission shows 120 officials with British nationality have secured additional passports of an EU state since March 2017, when the official article 50 notice was given that the UK was leaving the bloc. According to the Irish broadcaster RT√â, 10% of the 569 Irish passport holders working for the commission were originally British passport holders. Anyone with an Irish parent, or a grandparent born in Ireland is entitled to an Irish passport. Securing dual nationality with another member state may improve the career prospects of British citizens working in EU institutions but it is not guaranteed. To be eligible for an EU career, candidates must be a citizen of an EU country and be entitled to full rights as an EU citizen.

The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted ""yes"". Margaret Thatcher, later to be leader of the Conservative party, campaigned to remain. Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the ""iron lady"" marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand 'our own money back'claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back'despite being one of the 'three poorer'members of the community. It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.† Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in 'embryo'ù. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU. Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was 'òno, no, no' to what she saw as Delors' continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch's Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered 'Up yours Delors'front page. A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of 'a single market without barriers - visible or invisible - giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world's wealthiest and most prosperous people"". Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.† Tony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers' rights. Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. 'Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,'he said in his maiden speech. 'The level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.'Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro. EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club. Anti-immigration hysteria seems to take hold with references to 'cockroches'by Katie Hopkins in the Sun and tabloid headlines such as 'How many more can we take?'and 'Calais crisis: send in the dogs'ù. David Cameron returns from Brussels with an EU reform package - but it isn't enough to appease the Eurosceptic wing of his own party The UK votes to leave the European Union, triggering David Cameron's resignation and paving the way for Theresa May to become prime minister After years of parliamentary impasse during Theresa May's attempt to get a deal agreed, the UK leaves the EU. However, in a notice issued after article 50 was invoked, the commission said: 'The commission has taken note of the fact that a number of UK nationals among its staff have requested or may request a change towards a different first nationality. These changes are of an exceptional nature and therefore deserve a specific handling. 'As a consequence, staff members from the United Kingdom who declare a change of nationality after 29 March 2017 shall still be considered to have kept the UK nationality as first nationality for the purpose of ensuring a balanced representation of staff within the commission, notably at middle-management and senior management level,'said an official notice. This is to ensure staff nationalities are in proportion to the membership of the union. UK nationals in the commission were not the only Britons to have sought security in dual EU-UK nationality. Last month, it emerged that 1,403 British nationals in Belgium had naturalised and have Belgian passports, up from 506 in 2016 and 127 in 2015. This is part of an EU-wide trend, with more than 350,000 UK citizens living in Britain or a member state opting for dual nationality as a post-Brexit insurance policy. ",0.5,Positive
The Guardian view on Boris Johnson's 'òlevelling up': there's no quick fix,-0.75,Negative,"After an election governments tend to do two things. First, ministers take advantage of their opponent's disarray by framing the script for the next parliament with a compelling narrative, deploying catchphrases that will make their story stick in the public's memory long after the headlines have faded. Second they administer the bitter pill of spending restraint, so that fiscal goodies can be doled out ahead of the next election. BorisJohnson is bucking the trend by doing the first but not the second. He has taken high-stakes gambles to win power. Whether his latest bet pays off will depend on how right the prime minister proves to be about both politics and economics. Mr Johnson says he wants to keep the Labour votes he says were 'lent'to the Conservatives in December's election. At the top of the new government's agenda is the idea of 'levelling up'and squashing regional inequalities. This is a desirable goal, not least in swathes of the country where people have been left feeling disenfranchised and ignored. But this will take time. There is no quick fix to tackle entrenched problems such as: why pupils in the poorest areas in the north are four times more likely to attend schools graded less than good than their London counterparts; or why men in Manchester can expect to die nine years younger than those in leafy Hampshire; or why the average northern worker produces £4 less per hour than their counterpart in the south. However, Mr Johnson is in a hurry to consolidate his grip, and the signs are that the government is preparing for a splurge. The prime minister has signalled that he is prepared to rewrite Treasury rules to ensure that the focus of this cash will be on the north of England, Wales and the Midlands. His welcome announcement that HS2 will go ahead speaks to this agenda. Such spending ought to help an economy which at the end of 2019 had ground to a halt, bringing an end to the worst decade of recovery in two centuries. Far from spurring a rethink, the 2008 financial crash accelerated the concentration of wealth and power into the hands of a few. Mr Johnson's Treasury team is said to be weighing up a big tax raid on higher earners, and perhaps even a mansion tax to pay for his 'levelling up'agenda. Wearing Labour's clothes is uncomfortable for many Tories. One Daily Telegraph reader fumed that 'Corbyn's ideas did win over the electorate'ù. The Treasury does not need to raise taxes. In the upcoming budget, thanks to relaxed spending rules Sajid Javid will have £60bn extra to spend over the next four years. Two-thirds of this will be skewed towards investment and the rest left for day-to-day spending. Claiming to be attuned to the 'people's priorities'ù, Mr Johnson won't be constrained by conventional Treasury cheeseparing. He is right to spend more and run a higher budget deficit. However, the flaw at the heart of his policies is that Britain's unequal economy is a product of Conservative thinking which remains fundamentally unchanged. Too many announcements - such as locating the House of Lords in York or seating the BBC director general in the north - appear not to be about redistributing power but a chance to deride 'metropolitan'London. Lurking behind Mr Johnson's rhetoric is an attempt to move past Brexit and the UK's defiant stance in trade talks to return to business as usual - but with no greater say for the voters than before. He has not responded to the 2016 referendum result with an idea to build a more democratic and sustainable economy. For that voters will have to look somewhere else. ",0,Neutral
Barnier tells UK: don't kid yourself about financial services deal,0.25,Positive,"Michel Barnier has warned Sajid Javid and Boris Johnson that 'they should not kid themselves'that Brussels will give a special deal to the City of London after a photograph emerged of the UK's opening negotiating position on the new post-Brexit arrangements. A briefing paper, snapped by a long-lens camera as it was taken into Downing St on Monday, suggested the UK would seek in the coming negotiations a 'permanent equivalence'regime for financial services that would last for 'decades to come'ù. Speaking in the European parliament in Strasbourg, the EU's chief negotiator scotched the chancellor's hopes for maintaining such stable access to the European market after the end of 2020, when the UK leaves the single market and customs union. 'I'd like to take this opportunity to make it clear to certain people in the United Kingdom authority that they should not kid themselves about this. There will not be general open-ended ongoing equivalence in financial services, nor other management or financial agreements with the United Kingdom,'Barnier said. 'We will keep control of these tools, and we will retain the free-hand to take our own decisions.'Negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU are due to start in the first week of March. At the end of the transition period, the British financial services sector will no longer have the right to operate in the EU as it does today. The City will instead rely on Brussels judging that the UK's regulations and supervisory systems are sufficiently robust - a so-called equivalence decision that can be overturned with as little as 30 days' notice. The document photographed outside Downing Street said that Javid would instead be seeking 'comprehensive, permanent equivalence decisions'ù, according to a report in the Financial Times. Such an equivalence deal could mean foreign companies such as investment firms and clearing houses can serve European customers largely from their home base and avoid having to set up a subsidiary in the EU. Barnier told MEPs that Brussels would not even engage in talks on the topic let alone be open to granting such a deal. He said: 'We are not negotiating on these topics, rather we are checking that there is consistency and wherever possible granting equivalence on particular sectors of the financial industry. 'That's what we did with Canada, that's what we did with the United States. It works. So I don't see why it shouldn't work with the United Kingdom.'While all the focus on Brexit talks has been on goods, the financial services chapter in any trade deal is critical for the UK. It employs more than 1 million people and contributes £127bn to the economy, according to Javid in an article in City AM on Tuesday. 'We hope to agree a chapter on financial services in the UK-EU free trade agreement that establishes a baseline for the trading relationship,'the chancellor said. 'If the EU, like us, wants a durable relationship, we should also include measures to directly address the long-term needs of industry for a reliable equivalence process.'He said this offered 'the best solution to the question of agreeing our relationship with the EU this year'and was 'important not only in the short term, but to establish the norms and ways of working with the EU that will endure for the decades to come'ù. The photograph of the briefing paper sets out two possible 'landing zones'in talks with the EU. One would involve 'selective equivalence'and a side deal committing to a 'joint declaration on cooperation'which would kick in if the deal the government hopes to conclude by the end of the year does not include financial services. The second 'landing zone'would be a 'time-limited'agreement on financial services. ",0,Neutral
Memo to British political pundits: Ireland's election isn't about you,0,Neutral,"There has been no shortage of surprises in Ireland's election results. A party historically linked to the Provisional IRA won the popular vote. A political duopoly rooted in a civil war a century earlier has, finally, ended. And nobody knows what the next government will look like. Given all this real drama, it was more than a bit curious to see the reaction from sections of the British media. After more than three years covering Brexit as if it were a football match, more than a few British pundits seemed determined to shoehorn Ireland's shifting politics into a black/white view of the world with Britain at its centre. At times, it felt as if London journalists were commenting on a different election altogether. Some of the errors were factual. A Financial Times reporter wrongly declared on Twitter that the outgoing taoiseach Leo Varadkar had lost his seat - apparently not understanding that Ireland uses a different electoral system to the UK. (Varadkar had to sweat until the fifth round of counting.) Another newspaper's election 'explainer'got the number of seats in Ireland wrong.  More often, however, the Irish election hot-takes were - well, decidedly lukewarm: Sinn FÈin's surprising success was just like Brexit, or Donald Trump. The BBC's venerable foreign correspondent John Simpson declared that Ireland, 'which has been politically stable for decades'ù, had now 'succumbed to populism'without providing any evidence of what he meant.  Other commentators, including a Conservative political strategist, declared that Irish voters had primarily been motivated by a rising tide of anti-British sentiment. (In fact, just 1% said that Brexit was their number one election issue.) Sorry guys, but not everything is about you. Yes, Brexit brought old resentments towards Britain to the fore, but this election was mainly fought on bread-and-butter politics. The much-vaunted economic recovery has not been felt by vast swaths of the population, especially those trying to find a home. The health service is a mess. No wonder most Irish voters listed housing and health as their primary concerns. Looking at the Irish election purely through the prism of British politics - or even of the rise of populism - misses a lot of the nuances of what has happened in Ireland. Having rejected Fianna F√°il in 2011 - the party of √âamon De Valera was blamed for bankrupting the country in the financial crisis - Irish voters have turned their back on Fine Gael too. The parties' combined vote looks likely to be about 43%, a record low. Sinn FÈin's surge has been remarkable. In my native county, the party topped the poll with an unknown candidate in a constituency in which Sinn FÈin had not won a seat in decades. That pattern was repeated across the country. The Sinn FÈin triumph has changed Ireland's electoral landscape - and could change its relations with Britain. A border poll on Irish unity is firmly on the political agenda. But here again, British commentators would do well to take a deeper look at what's going on. A majority of young Irish voters now say they want to see border poll soon. But more than Irish unification they want public services and better prospects. Almost a third of young people in Dublin voted for Sinn FÈin. The republicans' success ensured that a slew of leftwing candidates were also elected as Sinn FÈin's voters transferred to the Greens, the Social Democrats and other parties under Ireland's proportional voting system. The Sinn FÈin tsunami was not preordained. Many Irish voters wanted change but only alighted on Mary Lou McDonald's party as the vehicle for their disaffection relatively late in the campaign. Having performed badly in recent European and local elections, Sinn FÈin unexpectedly emerged as the alternative consensus in the closing weeks. These are the paradoxes and complexities of a dynamic political situation. Which is something that many British commentators have not had to deal with for quite a long time now. Watching RTE's excellent election coverage over the weekend, I was struck by the absence of the predictable thinktankers and partisan talking heads that often dominate British political coverage. Rather than discussing the election they wished had happened, studio guests were talking about the vote that had taken place. Maybe it's time Britain followed Ireland's lead.

The brutal truth about Dominic Cummings,0,Neutral,"Stefan Collini's trawl through Dominic Cummings' writings (The long read, 6 February) is a helpful insight into the mind of a maverick. However, in giving credence to Cummings' enthusiastic embrace of (natural) science, Collini, as a literary critic and historian, risks falling victim to his own critique of those who speak outside their disciplinary comfort zone. Cummings' understanding of modern genetics, IQ, evolutionary psychology, child development and neuroscience, as evidenced by his blog and advice to Michael Gove when education minister, is a mishmash of half-understood, controversial, and sometimes just plain wrong assertions. As Cummings argues, politicians need advice from experts, but his deference to the physical and life sciences excludes evidence from the social sciences to its peril (as witness the free school debacle). Beware the autodidact bringing gifts; truly, a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing.Steven RoseEmeritus professor of neuroscience, Open University '¢ I read Stefan Collini's article with great interest. He describes the high value Cummings places on scientific literacy and his fascination for ideas, but this alleged intellectual powerhouse lost all credibility when I read of his dismissal of the social sciences. Insights and solutions to many of society's ills have been offered by social scientists since the 1950s and earlier. The links between income and health, the roots of youth crime are all there in numerous reports, should this government need the evidence to address them. It is clear from this article that Cummings has a very selective interest in ideas. He is only interested in those that support him and not ones that look to achieve the greater good. This explains everything about this government.Hildegard DumperNailsea, Somerset '¢ Stefan Collini describes Cummings as 'undeniably clever'(though presumably not so clever that Collini can't find numerous inconsistencies in his views). However, I must take issue with his observation that Cummings 'quotes Nietzsche fairly often, but then who doesn't?'This may be the case in Collini's circle, and my friends and I speak of little else down Wetherspoon's on a Tuesday evening, but I suspect Nietzsche ('There are no facts, only interpretations'ù) is a closed book to the general populace - if not to Cummings.Bill BradburyBolton '¢ Stefan Collini must be thanked for his erudite and illuminating essay on the thinking of Dominic Cummings; those of us who have also tried reading Cummings' writings, will be keenly aware of the labour and tedium his research involved. Cummings is a historian. He must know the extent to which affairs are affected by whim, caprice, accident: the founding fathers, for instance, would never have anticipated the state of their constitution under Trump. Cummings appears, however, to believe they can be directed according to mathematical patterns, scientific systems. These work wonderfully with physical phenomena, rather less well with people. His lack of any empathetic understanding of how humanity actually operates - which may explain his lack of interest in the arts - suggests at the very least that life under the government he runs under the nominal premiership of Johnson may potentially be very brutal indeed.Michael RosenthalUpper Brailes, Warwickshire '¢ For some of those who have not read Cummings' blogs as Collini has, it has long seemed obvious that Cummings was a highly articulate chancer and mercenary for neo-liberal US billionaires. Of course his solipsistic assurance and his effectiveness in managing the leave campaign will have impressed those of lesser intellectual competence, from the PM onwards, but look at the damage his apparent advice has done to the educational system. It does not even conform to what Collini quotes Cummings as having written about what education should do, though it reflects the contempt Cummings appears to hold for ordinary people who are, after all, also members of our society, even if not on his radar. We shall see what all his smokescreen chatter about science is worth when it comes to the US trade talks and their lax food standards to be imposed on us profit-generating consumers as against the EU standards, or any of the other socially responsible restrictions on market freedom necessitated by environmental concerns. It looks as if the blog is a deliberate distraction of the public readers away from what his real objectives are. Collini has done a useful job analysing the distractions, but they add weight to the cynical interpretation that if Cummings believed what he writes and advised his political masters accordingly, we would see more respect for law and human values in government policies.John Veit-WilsonNewcastle upon Tyne  '¢ Stefan Collini's fascinating analysis didn't touch on the curious fact that Cummings trained as a historian, while showing only limited signs of understanding modern history theory, nor on his adulation for Bismarck, whose views of politics and political processes seem to be at odds with his own. Cummings the technocrat appears not to have understood Bismark's view that politics is not an exact science but an art, the art of the possible.Miles ParkerFowlmere, Cambridgeshire '¢ Perhaps it's time that 'Classic Dom'became 'Quel Dommage'.Ruth EversleyPaulton, Somerset '¢ Join the debate - email guardian.letters@theguardian.com '¢ Read more Guardian letters - click here to visit gu.com/letters '¢ Do you have a photo you'd like to share with Guardian readers?

A Dominic Cummings coup will not oust the Whitehall mandarins,0,Neutral,"The prime minister's senior adviser and 'enforcer'ù, Dominic Cummings, says he wants what amounts to a cultural revolution in Whitehall. If by welcoming what he called 'weirdos and misfits with odd skills'in a provocative podcast early this year, he meant risk-takers, can-doers, people who understand the digital world and information technology, Whitehall certainly needs them. The mandarins of permanent government need shaking up. For far too long, they have been shielded from the rigours of the outside world, protected by a formidable array of weapons, notably the Official Secrets Act, a measure designed to deter whistleblowers as much as potential spies. But their arsenal includes much more subtle weapons than criminal law. One is deployed with such little effort it can be easily overlooked. It is the use of language, a craft honed over many decades and embedded deep in Whitehall subculture. It is a weapon often used against MPs. As the late Sir Patrick Nairne, a widely respected mandarin, was honest enough to admit: 'The secrecy culture of Whitehall is essentially a product of British parliamentary democracy; economy with the truth is the essence of a professional reply to a parliamentary question.'Being economical with the truth is what the former cabinet secretary, Sir Robert (now Lord) Armstrong, admitted to when questioned during the government's attempt to suppress Spycatcher, the memoirs of former MI5 officer Peter Wright. Civil servants are careful not to commit to 'a direct lie'ù, as Sir Clive Whitmore, Margaret Thatcher's principal private secretary, once put it, but to give a 'misleading impression'ù, as Armstrong explained in the Spycatcher case. Whitehall officials can even mislead themselves as they told the Scott arms-to-Iraq inquiry. And as Ian McDonald, the Ministry of Defence spokesman during the Falklands war but later involved in promoting arms exporters, told Scott: 'Truth is a very difficult concept.'The careful use of language has been developed into a fine craft. It is essential in Whitehall to avoid making commitments and to put off decisions. (The power of delay should never be underestimated.) It is better when challenged about a policy to say it is 'under review'ù. Awkward problems are dealt with on a 'case by case'basis, conveniently leaving the government a way out. 'I hear what you say'ù, is one well-honed response, usefully combining the absence of commitment with the unspoken message to shut up. Euphemism is a useful, albeit soft, weapon to deploy. It is all part of the attempt to protect a shared comfort zone. Sir Ian (later Lord) Bancroft, head of the civil service under Thatcher, once described how much he enjoyed Anthony Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time. 'I actually believe as I get older that life is very much like the Anthony Powell novels in that you keep meeting the same people over and over again'¶'And, he might have added, you keep meeting them over and over again even after you have left the civil service. The number of officials (and senior military figures) who join private companies soon after retiring from public office in the so-called 'revolving doors'syndrome has increased significantly over recent years, perpetuating a lobby system straddling the public and private sectors behind the scenes. Cummings faces an uphill struggle. Thatcher failed to open up Whitehall, bringing in people from business and political advisers who promised to provoke radical reform. Tony Blair complained about 'the scars on my back'from his attempts to reform the public sector. Both Thatcher and Blair had big parliamentary majorities. Even if he wins where they failed and the Sir Humphreys of this world are truly put on the back foot, Cummings's Whitehall revolution is most unlikely to extend to more open government. For those now enjoying power in Downing Street and elsewhere in Whitehall- even, or especially, ministers' political advisers - that would be too much of a risk. Brexit may mean 'taking back control'from Brussels. But where will it go? Not to those members of the public who enthusiastically waved their union jacks. Not even to MPs as Johnson and his ministers have made it clear they have had enough of Commons interfering. They will not get much of a look-in, let alone influence, in the negotiations on a future deal with the EU (or Britain's commercial and diplomatic relations with the rest of the world). Despite all the populist rhetoric coming out of Downing Street, Whitehall's culture of secrecy, its control of information, will, if anything, be strengthened. Witness the recent attempts to exclude those journalists it disapproves of from official media briefings. MPs, just like the public, rely on the media to be informed and to hold ministers to account in parliament. They have one weapon in their arsenal, the vote. But this weapon is severely blunted when the government has such a large majority. Whitehall (by which I include ministers' political advisers as well as civil servants) has so many weapons at its disposal. It would be ironic indeed that as the historic democratic deficit of EU institutions is lifting, with the European parliament increasing its power and influence, Whitehall keeps the shutters even more firmly down, with the age-old British disease of official secrecy making a mockery of claims about taking back control and restoring sovereignty.

Quiet diplomacy can really get Brexit done,0.25,Positive,"As we enter the beginning of the next phase of Brexit, the sabre-rattling has been deafening, with negotiators preparing for 'tough talks'on the future relationship (Europe's British question: what comes next?, Journal, 5 February). Talking tough may be one negotiating strategy, but in order to get the best outcome, we will also need bridge-builders and peacemakers preparing the ground for win-win outcomes, compromise and reconciliation. As Quakers and former MEPs, we know that this latter job was previously done by cross-party MEPs, alongside a multitude of British and European actors, working in quiet ways to build bridges and share information. Brexit threatens these vital back-channels. Quakers have long played a quiet but instrumental role in European peacebuilding - from refugee relief after the second world war to today's Quaker Council for European Affairs advocating for humane EU security and migration policies. Today more than ever, we need to invest in our quiet diplomats.Jude Kirton-DarlingMEP for North East England 2014-20 Molly Scott CatoMEP for South West England 2014-20 '¢ Ian McEwan was exacting in his analysis (Brexit: It's done, 1 February), but what he didn't pick up on was the inadequate role of the MEPs who we voted for but who had no remit to keep us up to date with their input into EU decision-making. Somehow our politics and probably the media didn't seem to think we needed to know what was going on over there or to report on the EU's relevance in our everyday lives. No wonder the 'them and us'mindset developed, especially after Farage began his full frontal assault. Sadly, he got the publicity and the EU got the flak.

EU focuses on enlargement into Balkans after Brexit,0.125,Positive,"Less than a week after the departure of the UK, Brussels is seeking to breathe new life into the enlargement of the EU, unveiling an overhaul of the process for joining the bloc. The long-awaited document from the European commission was published less than a week after the first ever departure of a big country. One main purpose is to keep alive the EU ambition for six western Balkan nations, with a combined population of 17.9 million people. No country has joined the EU since Croatia in 2013, but Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia hope to eventually. The paper is also intended to assuage doubts about further EU expansion among member states wearied by the eurozone crisis as well as backsliding on the rule of law and persistent corruption in some EU countries. It draws heavily on a plan put forward by Emmanuel Macron, who last year vetoed North Macedonia's hopes of starting membership talks, causing despair among politicians in the region. The French president also joined Denmark and the Netherlands in blocking Albania. Good message to our #WesternBalkans friends about EU enlargement process: Today the @EU_Commission proposes a credible & dynamic plan paving the way for opening accession talks with North Macedonia & Albania (üá≤üá∞üá¶üá±). EU enlargement is a WIN-WIN situation. #geopoliticalcommission Potential EU member states have to complete 35 chapters to match EU standards in numerous areas, from a functioning public administration to fisheries to financial regulation. The new proposals mean that all countries will be required to complete fundamental reforms on democratic institutions and the rule of law before attempting more technical reforms. France complained that the EU enlargement process lacked credibility and said applicants should be required to repeat negotiating 'chapters'if they later unpicked key reforms, an idea the commission has adopted. EU enlargement had to be 'more credible'for EU member states and those seeking to join, the EU enlargement commissioner, OlivÈr V√°rhelyi, told journalists. 'It has to be more predictable, more dynamic and more political,'he said, adding that 'very many member states'had raised concerns in private, beyond countries that had voiced opposition in public. If countries seeking to join the EU could meet the criteria 'then it can actually go quicker and in a much more meaningful way'ù. The new criteria will not apply to Serbia and Montenegro, which have embarked on EU accession under old rules. V√°rhelyi said it was 'their choice'to opt into the new system, adding that he could see grounds to do so. The former Romanian prime minister Dacian Ciolo»ô, who sits with Macron's MEPs in the European parliament, described the plans as a good step forward, adding that his group 'fully supports'new impetus to EU enlargement. 'The next step, after agreeing on the new methodology, should be the opening of accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania,'he said. ",0,Neutral
UK universities will only lead the world if they keep Erasmus and EU research funds,0.125,Positive,"Brexit is a sad moment, as is always the case whenever a member of a community leaves. But for European universities, it may be felt as a particular blow. We've been overwhelmingly in favour of the UK staying in the European Union because of our strong tradition of working across borders, whether it's researchers working in international teams to make groundbreaking discoveries or students spending their formative years in the Erasmus programme.  We're also connected by a common sense of purpose and the recognition that we can do more together than we can alone. I have worked in Brussels for nearly two decades, mostly facilitating UK engagement in EU research and education programmes and fostering cross-border cooperation, and I have witnessed both the desire to work collaboratively and the tangible benefits this collaboration brings to universities and society. The good news is that this is likely to continue after Brexit, thanks to plans to keep the UK in European research funding and student mobility programmes, such as Erasmus and Horizon Europe. But the bad news is that if we want this transition to be smooth, time is short. Universities in the UK and the EU need to pressure the negotiating teams to stay on track.  Several issues are likely to complicate negotiations: Should the UK take part in all or only some areas of EU research and education programmes? How should financial contributions be calculated? How much alignment on rules do we need between the UK and the EU, for instance regarding mobility of researchers and students? This can all too easily become an exercise in petty calculations about who gives and who receives more, but knowledge is not a zero-sum game; we will all benefit from working closely together, as we have in the past.  For this reason, the sensible goal is full association of the UK to the Horizon research funding programme and Erasmus student mobility at the very least. This is what universities in Europe want.  We must also be more ambitious for the new relationship. The EU is planning to strengthen the European Research Area, as well as form the European Education Area, and the UK needs to be part of this. These areas will reflect the fact that Europe is like no other place in the world: its potential to produce transformative research, education and innovation is unique thanks to the high number of large research-intensive universities with different cultural contexts and traditions across a wide geographical area. These capabilities are bolstered by Europe's culture of cooperation, which has been shaped by the unusual possibility of working in a truly multilateral, international funding system through the EU research programmes. Europe is the only place where there is a system that allows universities from many countries to come together around many different subjects. The UK is a valuable piece of this puzzle: it has the most high-level research outputs, is a leader in new technology and is the most popular destination for mobile students. Europe will lose out if the UK is missing, and the UK will suffer if it stands on the sidelines while the EU becomes a global hub for research and education. Neither the US nor China will provide alternatives to what the EU has the potential to offer. This year will be crucial. The negotiations on the future relationship between the EU and the UK will set the foundations for continued close cooperation in research and education. Universities across the continent must be united in their aim to reach quick and comprehensive agreements on the formal structures, with priority given to continuous and full association to the Erasmus and Horizon Europe programmes. Time is short and the process will be complex, but there is will and there is a way. Amanda Crowfoot is secretary general of the European University Association ",0,Neutral

"'Speak only English' posters racially aggravated, say police",0,Neutral,"The distribution of 'Brexit day'posters that warned residents of a block of flats to speak only English is being investigated as a racially aggravated incident, police have said. The printed posters, with the title 'Happy Brexit Day'ù, were stuck to doors on all 15 floors of Winchester Tower in Norwich on Friday morning, the day the UK formally left the European Union. Addressing residents, it said the 'Queens [sic] English is the spoken tongue here'and hailed the moment 'we finally get our great country back'ù. It said those unwilling to speak English should leave the UK. The text read: 'You won't have long till our government will implement rules that will put British first. So, best evolve or leave. God Save the Queen, her government and all true patriots.'Norfolk police said all the posters had been removed and were being examined for forensic evidence. Officers were working with the council to examine any CCTV footage of the block. A spokeswoman added: 'There is no place in society for hatred and intolerance. Nobody should have to face intimidation because of who they are and it is more important than ever that we stand together in the face of hostility. We remain committed to helping people feel safe and secure as they go about their lives. 'The matter is being dealt with as a racially aggravated public order incident.'Writing on Twitter on Saturday, Norwich city council said: 'You may have seen a photo of a poster that has appeared in one of our properties. 'Norwich has a proud history of being a welcoming city, and we will not tolerate this behaviour. As soon as we became aware of this incident, we reported it to Norfolk police and they are investigating. 'We take this very seriously and encourage residents to contact us or the police if they have any concerns.'Residents said the signs were left on fire doors across all 15 floors of the block of flats before being removed by the caretaker. Mike Stonard, a cabinet member on Norwich council, told the Eastern Daily Press: 'I absolutely condemn this abhorrent poster. Whoever put it there has committed a hate crime, it is as simple as that. 'Many people voted for Brexit for a range of different reasons. However, I am sure not many of them will condone this kind of thing.'",0.25,Positive
It was all a dream: there was no way to stop Brexit,0,Neutral,"Until quite recently, many people fervently believed this day would never arrive. Just over three months ago, Brexit finally seemed to have pushed British politics to the brink of a nervous breakdown. There were tears and tantrums in parliament. There were petitions and protests outside. A litany of lawsuits was waiting in the wings to derail the whole process. Ardent remainers felt they were tantalisingly close to stopping Brexit altogether. The future looked wide open. From a second referendum to a government of national unity, from toppling over the cliff edge to beating a full retreat, almost anything appeared possible. Yet here we are - one day after formally leaving, just as the British people decided on 23 June 2016 - and all that is gone. What happened? Were the last four years a mirage? The emotions were real. It was the sense of possibility that was an illusion. In recent years, some surprising political outcomes have seemed to pass from being impossible to being inevitable without ever taking the time to be merely improbable. Jeremy Corbyn's election as Labour leader was like that: what couldn't conceivably happen suddenly couldn't be stopped. Brexit has taken us on a much more circuitous journey. Before the referendum, plenty of people assumed that leaving the European Union was out of the question. Then, in the immediate aftermath of the vote, it looked like a fait accompli. Shocking though the result might have been, the choice was clear and we would all have to live with it - just like any other election result. Yet over the following months and then years, Brexit drifted back into the realms of the improbable. There were so many potential barriers in its way, and so many people determined to raise them, that what had seemed like a done deal gradually became an open question. Opposition, which might have been expected to dissipate over time, instead grew. Rather than a result to which the losing side needed to reconcile itself, it became a historic injustice to be avenged. It was as though the Brexit referendum had torn a hole in the normal functioning of British politics. We had passed through a portal to somewhere strange - and the job was to find a way to return to the place we had left behind. The opponents of Brexit took heart from the fact that because the referendum had apparently upended the old political order - along with their own sense of order - it ought to be possible to upend Brexit. The way to undo the referendum was to treat it as a rupture in the political space-time continuum, and to repair the tear. This was a mistake. The Brexit referendum did not stand outside the normal run of British politics. It was a product of that politics. The illusion was to believe that direct democracy, in the form of a high-stakes referendum, had somehow derailed parliamentary democracy and that therefore the task was to get it back on track. But Brexit all made sense - and only made sense - as a product of parliamentary democracy. An elected government, enacting its will through parliament, made the referendum happen. Only an elected government, enacting its will through parliament, could deal with the consequences. The old rules still applied. Everything else was just for show. The show included the growing demands for a second referendum. It was a passion play, full of its own heroic performances. This demand made total sense for anyone who believed that the first referendum was an outlandish event that needed to meet its match: having passed through the portal we required some equivalent way of passing back. But if you started from the premise that we had never left politics as usual, then pushing for a second referendum was always a quixotic enterprise. There was no way to get there. Parliament would have had to agree not only that it was a good idea, but also on the question to be asked, the rules under which it was to be held and the meaning of its outcome. This was obviously impossible in the existing parliament. But any parliament that could not agree on Brexit would not have been able to agree on a second referendum. And any parliament that can agree on Brexit doesn't need one. Why did the illusion take such a strong hold over so many people? As with much else in contemporary politics, there was a generational divide. Among older remainers, for whom the result of the referendum was wildly outside the bounds of what they understood as political normality, it seemed like it had to be countered in kind, with something equally abnormal. For younger remainers, especially those in their late teens or early 20s, the last few years had been the only politics they really knew. Wasn't this - the chaos, the emotion, the sense of possibility - how it worked? No. But it's easy to see why it would look like that if that's all you've encountered. The general election of 2017 helped to perpetuate the illusion. Labour came very close to another enormous shock. It looked once again like anything might be possible. But Labour only managed to do as well as it did by parking the issue of Brexit. Both main parties went into that election promising to respect the result of the referendum. It was only when Theresa May's failure to win a majority produced a weak and vulnerable government that it seemed as though the result might have been a rebuke to Brexit itself. It wasn't. In 2017, when the fate of Brexit was not on the table, people voted in a way to make Brexit harder to achieve. But in 2019, when two years of parliamentary stalemate had put Brexit in serious doubt, they voted to make Brexit happen. The seeming possibility of stopping Brexit was an unintended byproduct of the voters having assumed it was bound to happen. Once that assumption came into question, Brexit became inevitable again. It was not only on the remain side that it sometimes felt as though everything was up for grabs. Plenty of Brexiteers were deceived, too. Within the parliamentary Conservative party the despair was palpable during the nadir of May's government. The fear was real that not only might Brexit be lost, but the party itself might be wiped out. In last spring's European elections the Conservatives polled the lowest national vote share in their history, while Nigel Farage's Brexit party was riding high. But the Tories have one great advantage at times like these. When no one knows what to do, Conservatives focus on their parliamentary survival. And since parliamentary survival is the name of the game in a parliamentary democracy - nothing about the Brexit referendum had changed that - it often works. The person who saw this most clearly was Dominic Cummings. At a low point in the fortunes of Boris Johnson's new government last autumn, when it had been defeated in the courts, was being stymied in parliament and mocked in the press - 'Classic Dom!'- Cummings gave a rare public appearance in which he said that compared to winning the referendum itself, what he was going through as the prime minister's chief adviser was 'a walk in the park'ù. It sounded shockingly arrogant. He can't have meant he knew he was going to win in the end - no one ever knows that. But it did mean that he knew the only way to win. He had no choice but to focus on the fact that the existing parliament would never agree on how to stop Brexit, and to get to a new parliament his opponents would have to give him a general election under circumstances that did not suit them. The rest was just noise. Cummings was convinced that the really hard part had been to win the referendum itself, given that the old rules still applied. He had needed to shock the existing system. Engineering a successful public vote to take Britain out of the EU in the face of establishment opposition - including in parliament, where most MPs were strongly opposed to the idea - was truly an outrageous achievement. But since the old rules still applied, turning the referendum result into reality through parliament was far more straightforward. All he had to do was reabsorb the shock back into the existing system. The status quo would take care of the rest. The iconoclast could safely reinvent himself, if only for a few months, as an upholder of the established order. Even the failed prorogation of parliament, which probably generated the most passion of all, was another distraction. Cummings wasn't really trying to get round parliament. He was just trying to get parliament to function like it used to. With hindsight, we can see that the illusion Brexit might be stopped made it easier for Brexit to happen in its current, harder form. Opportunities were missed to moderate it. If Labour MPs who were tempted to vote for May's deal early last year had actually done so, we would have had a softer Brexit than the one that is now looming. But hindsight creates its own illusions. May's deal became softer as she became weaker in parliament; her weakness in parliament made it much harder for Labour MPs to support her deal. Those who considered it were accused of 'complicity with Brexit'ù. Propping up a wounded prime minister under those circumstances looked like treachery. For all the sound and fury, few politicians felt they had much of a choice. They were boxed in by the growing intensity of sentiment on all sides, as much as they were by parliamentary arithmetic. From the day of the referendum result, Brexit was probably inevitable. It sounds fatalistic. But it doesn't have to be: if the old rules still apply, then from today everything changes again. Up until this moment, the Brexit vote was something that parliamentary politics needed to acknowledge - it had to be swallowed, somehow. But now it's been swallowed, it ceases to be an event that any government is required to accommodate. It becomes something that this government owns. It also ceases to be the people's responsibility. It's now Johnson's responsibility. This means the will of the people can no longer be so readily invoked in the face of parliamentary opposition. The people didn't make his deal and the people didn't pass this legislation. The people aren't going to negotiate the future relationship either. It's on Johnson and his ministers and his chief adviser. So the opposition is free to let rip. It's true that the people chose this government and this prime minister at the last general election. So isn't it still ultimately the voters' responsibility? But that's not how parliamentary politics works. The voters don't own the consequences of their choices at election time. They reserve the right to blame the politicians they pick for everything that subsequently happens. We don't choose the policies in a representative democracy. We choose the politicians. And if anything goes wrong, it's the politicians we will get to pillory. As it passes from unspecified future event to messy present reality, Brexit has gone from being something that almost nothing could derail to something that almost anything could. Coronavirus? A global recession? A trade war between the US and China? None of these is about Brexit, but any of them could make Brexit a much more precarious business. If that happens, we will know who to blame. It will be Boris Johnson's fault, even though none of that is really his fault - unlike the referendum result, which really was his fault, and for which he could never be made to shoulder the blame, no matter how hard people tried. If we want an idea of how things might go from here, one possible parallel is with the Iraq war. Of course, in that case there was no referendum beforehand. But there were huge street protests, passionate opposition, massively divided public opinion and a widespread sense of looming calamity. It couldn't be stopped, because the opposition could not muster enough support in the one place that mattered: parliament. Both of the two main parties were full of doubters, but it proved impossible to make those doubts decisive in the face of a prime minister with a large parliamentary majority determined to forge ahead. The Liberal Democrats, who became the vehicle for parliamentary opposition, never had the numbers to make the difference. The voting public, who had elected the Tony Blair government that did the deed, somewhat reluctantly re-elected that government in 2005. But the voters never blamed themselves for what happened. They blamed their rulers for having lied to them. They took their time, but when they got the chance the people took their revenge, in part by ejecting Labour and helping the Liberal Democrats into coalition government. In some ways, the people have been taking their revenge ever since. One of the long-term consequences of the Iraq war and the mistrust it sowed in the British political system was Brexit. Revenge in such cases can be a dish served very cold indeed. The long-term consequences of Brexit - the Brexit that this government is now undertaking on the people's behalf but no longer in their name - are likely to be equally profound. Some governments will eventually be broken by it, perhaps even including the current one. Once the people had voted for it in the referendum, Brexit was bound to happen in some form. But now that it is happening in its present form, the people are free to think again. The last four years created the impression that British politics had entered a new space of possibility. That was an illusion. The real possibilities start today. '¢ David Runciman is professor of politics at Cambridge University ",-1.125,Negative
The special bond between Ireland and the UK will not be undermined by Brexit,0,Neutral,"Today marks an end and a beginning. Forty-seven years after both Ireland and the UK joined the European Economic Community, the latter has chosen to leave and to take a new path. It is a sombre day for some in the UK and a positive one for others. Whatever your perspective, it's clear that the decision to leave the EU will bring change. In Ireland, we will always regret that our closest neighbour and partner will no longer sit with us and the other member states around the EU table in Brussels. We still don't have the full picture of the final terms of the UK's future relationship with the EU, but we know it will not be the same. What's clear to me, as it has been to successive Irish governments, is that Ireland's bilateral relationship with the UK is, and will remain, of vital importance. It is based on deep ties of friendship and family, our common European heritage and values - ties that are deeply cherished. Our two nations are so deeply intertwined as a result of generations of personal contacts and interaction. Some 700,000 people from the island of Ireland live in towns and cities the length and breadth of Great Britain. Several millions more are Irish citizens by descent. Tens of thousands travel back and forth between the UK and Ireland every single week, and the London-Dublin air corridor is the busiest in Europe, the second busiest in the world. The common travel area, which has long enabled profound connection between our countries, was last year protected through a memorandum of understanding between both governments. British and Irish citizens will continue to move freely to live, to study, to work in any corner of these islands. British citizens resident in Ireland will be free to vote in our upcoming general election - a reciprocal privilege afforded to Irish citizens in the UK. These deep networks and this freedom of movement drive an economic and trading relationship between Ireland and the UK worth £1.1bn per week. Our desire to continue to foster such close ties will not change, although the level and intensity of this bilateral relationship will inevitably be shaped by future EU-UK arrangements. The closer the relationship between the EU and UK, the easier it will be to keep our two countries close. An approach based on partnership was central to the restoration of the power-sharing executive and assembly in Northern Ireland last month. That kind of cooperation, enshrined at the heart of the Good Friday agreement, has developed gradually, over decades, and it was underpinned by our common EU membership. But even as the UK leaves the EU, protection of the Good Friday agreement remains a shared priority for both our governments, as was acknowledged in the withdrawal agreement. As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday agreement, as a jurisdiction sharing the island of Ireland and as an EU member state, Ireland will play its part to ensure that the withdrawal agreement will work for the people of Ireland, north and south, for the UK and for the EU. Preparations are of course now under way for the next phase of negotiations: the future relationship. Ireland will continue to pursue its interests vigorously in this phase. At the same time, we will advocate for an ambitious deal that works to the benefit of all. And while we will miss the UK, it will continue to be an important and natural partner for the EU.  We will find ways to work together to advance our shared ideals on the global stage. The joint political declaration underlines our common determination to protect the rules-based international order, the rule of law and democracy, high standards of free and fair trade and workers' rights, and consumer and environmental protection, and to cooperate against internal and external threats to our values and interests. While today will undoubtedly usher in change, some things will remain constant. The geography of these islands, our extraordinary people-to-people interaction, and our trade - these will all endure. The UK and Irish governments will remain steadfast partners in supporting peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.  Our nations' relationship is a vital one, of rare complexity and intensity. No matter what challenges lie ahead, Ireland is committed to firm friendship with the UK - our neighbour and partner in the peace process - both now and in the years to come.

Keir Starmer calls on government to give EU citizens voting rights,0,Neutral,"Keir Starmer has called for all EU nationals in the UK to be given full voting rights as the clock ticks down to Brexit. The Labour leadership hopeful is calling on the government to give the 3 million EU nationals security after years of doubt and the sense they are only being 'tolerated'in the country, he claimed. EU nationals cannot vote in general elections but can in local government elections, police and crime commissioner, and local and regional mayoral elections. In a piece for the Guardian, the shadow Brexit secretary wrote: 'The government should give all EU nationals living in the UK full voting rights in future elections. 'The way the 3 million have been treated over the last three years is shameful. We were never just 'òtolerating' EU citizens living in this country. 'They are our neighbours and friends and families. To see their status in doubt devastates not just our sense of justice but of fellowship.'His intervention 24 hours before Britain leaves the EU is likely to appeal to remain supporters, who make up the bulk of the Labour party membership. He has been criticised previously for having been the joint-architect of Labour's Brexit policy, which has been cited as a major factor in their catastrophic defeat in December . Starmer argued for a second referendum and has faced criticism from those who fear he is not well-placed to win back the leave supporters whovoted Tory at the 2019 election. Stephen Barclay, theBrexit secretary , is due to return to the backbenches after the Whitehall Brexit department is dissolved, which makes Starmer's role unclear. Starmer also wrote that after Brexit , the leave-remain divide affecting the country must come to an end. He said: 'Defining people by how they voted in June 2016 merely upholds a divide that we must overcome. There are no leavers or remainers anymore. In 2024 there will no leave seats or remain constituencies.'He will also call for the Labour party to move on from the Brexit debate too, saying: 'I will move our party on from the division of the past and remake our party as a democratic movement that faces outwards towards the country not inwards on itself.'",0.875,Positive
The Guardian view on Huawei and 5G: the risks are real,-0.25,Negative,"The lead-up to Britain's formal departure from the European Union, at 11pm on Friday, has made headlines mainly due to a somewhat bathetic row over Big Ben and church bells. But in Downing Street, the fraught navigation of a post-Brexit landscape began in earnest this week, with a new kind of crisis over sovereignty. Boris Johnson's decision to allow the Chinese tech company Huawei a substantial role in supplying Britain's 5G network is his first key geopolitical move, raising vital questions over data security. The green light to Huawei was given in the teeth of concerted opposition from the US and some of the prime minister's own backbenchers. America has warned that the company's participation in 5G networks would represent a major security risk to the west, given its close relationship to the Chinese state. Huawei has already been excluded from 5G networks in Japan and Australia on the grounds that control of vital infrastructure could fall into the hands of a potentially hostile power. One Republican senator said on Tuesday that 'London has freed itself from Brussels only to cede sovereignty to Beijing'ù. Such talk is overblown; sovereignty also involves Britain exercising a right to make its own decisions without transatlantic bullying. But Mr Johnson undoubtedly faces a tricky meeting with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who arrives in London on Wednesday for talks with the prime minister. Earlier this week, Mr Pompeo described the Huawei decision as 'momentous'and suggested that future intelligence-sharing between Britain and America could be disrupted. Mr Johnson has the backing of his security chiefs, who believe the risk posed by Huawei, which has operated in Britain for over a decade, is manageable. He also hopes to forestall the inevitable fallout by building in restrictions to Huawei's future access and influence. The company has been designated a 'high-risk vendor'ù, excluded from 'core'activities of the 5G network, and its share of the market has been capped at 35%. Those limitations are sensible, but they do not eliminate risk. In Australia it was judged that the 5G era would collapse the distinction between core and periphery digital activity, making it impossible to police. In essence Mr Johnson has therefore signed up to a 'known unknown'ù, authorising Chinese participation in vital national infrastructure where future vulnerabilities are impossible to assess. There will be a need for constant and ongoing vigilance, especially if China continues to develop its authoritarian and domineering tendencies, at home and abroad, under the leadership of Xi Jinping. Washington has hinted that this decision may deplete stocks of goodwill ahead of post-Brexit trade negotiations that have become totemic for the government. The prime minister will hope that such talk was merely a case of playing hardball. But the decision to risk Donald Trump's ire, at such a sensitive moment, is revealing. The power of tech-driven growth and to propel Britain to the sunlit uplands is a prime article of faith in Mr Johnson's inner circle. Taking Huawei out of the 5G equation would have significantly delayed the introduction of high-speed internet across the country. That was a price the prime minister and his advisers were not willing to pay, even if that meant queering the post-Brexit pitch in trade terms. Mr Johnson has taken a gamble. On balance, given the advice of his own intelligence services, it was justifiable. But it is not, on any front, risk-free. ",0,Neutral
Brexit: EU to start talks with UK over future relationship on 3 March,-0.125,Negative,"Negotiations on the UK's post-Brexit relationship with the EU will start on 3 March, more than a month after the UK's departure from the bloc, the Guardian can reveal. As a British minister attended an EU meeting in Brussels for the final time after 47 years of membership of the bloc, sources disclosed that officials led by Michel Barnier and Boris Johnson's Europe adviser, David Frost, would embark on the vital talks in the first week of March with a challenging 10-month deadline. The UK is due to leave the EU on Friday at midnight central European time - nearly four years since the referendum. The prime minister has said he will not extend the transition period past 31 December 2020. Until then, the UK will stay in the single market and customs union. A leaked internal document from the EU member states, seen by the Guardian, notes that without a deal by the end of December 2020, there will be a 'cliff edge'in many areas and 'no return to the status quo'ù. The former European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker had said the negotiations on the future relationship would start on day one after the UK's exit but preparations on both sides of the Channel were delayed by the general election. Chris Pincher, the UK's minister for Europe and the Americas, said after his general affairs council meeting with peers among the 27 other member states - the last by a British minister in an EU setting - that it was a 'historic week'when the 'government will deliver on its promise'ù. Pincher said the UK was leaving the bloc's institutions as a 'sovereign equal'but that it would not be leaving Europe with which the country had a shared 'history, civilisation and values'ù. Once the talks on the future relationship start in earnest on 3 March, it will be access to fishing waters and the EU's demand for a 'level playing field'that are likely to pose the biggest obstacles to success. Johnson is expected to give a speech next week spelling out the British negotiating position. The EU does not have a zero-tariff, zero-quota, traditional free-trade agreement with any country in the world. Brussels is demanding guarantees that the UK will not steal an unfair competitive advantage. The bloc has staked out the uncompromising position that the current fisheries arrangements should largely continue. During a visit to Brussels for a meeting of ministers, AmÈlie de Montchalin, France's secretary of state for European affairs, said the talks could become complicated if the UK failed to recognise the EU's red lines. She said: 'For us, if there are no clear guarantees vis-√†-vis citizens and businesses. If there is no level playing field or fair conditions, the trade openness of the EU will not be total. 'The degree of openness of EU trade will depend on the level of convergence we reach. So, if Boris Johnson wants a deal in 11 months with zero quotas and zero tariffs, we must have guarantees of zero dumping and therefore of a level playing field. 'It's a fairly simple negotiation. However, we can make it complicated if we are inconsistent. It is impossible to imagine a completely new trading system in 11 months which would require a different normative framework for each area. It's not realistic. So we're going to deal with realistic things.'Brussels' opening negotiating position will be adopted by EU ministers at a meeting on 25 February. Before then, the two sides will be in 'scheduling and scoping'discussions to prepare for the unprecedented negotiation after the end of the UK's 45 years of EU membership. A senior EU official said the bloc 'will be tough on a level playing field'ù, adding: 'We will not budge.''We might have a conversation about how we keep to a minimum level of standards but we will not move on the need to have them,'the source said. The final political act in the UK's exit from the EU will take place on Wednesday evening when the European parliament is due to ratify the withdrawal agreement. ",0,Neutral
"'Get Ready for Brexit' campaign had little effect, says watchdog",-0.5,Negative,"Boris Johnson's government spent £46m on a 'Get Ready for Brexit'campaign in October, but demonstrated little evidence it left the public better prepared, Whitehall's spending watchdog has found.The National Audit Office said ministers chose to run a £100m campaign - the most expensive of four options - to tell all UK businesses and individuals how they should prepare for leaving the EU. The campaign was launched as the 31 October deadline for leaving the EU approached. But the evidence shows that the proportion of UK citizens who reported that they had looked or started to look for information, did not notably change, auditors said. Auditors said the numbers of people looking for information about Brexit did not notably change as a result - ranging from 32% and 37% during the campaign, to 34% when it stopped, having spent just under half of the allotted money. The campaign was halted three days before the UK was supposed to leave after the EU granted another extension. The report increases concerns over the government's spending leading up to the 31 October deadline set by the prime minister to leave the EU with or without a deal. It comes as the government prepares a new 'Ready to Trade'campaign on 1 February, the day after the UK is due to formally leave the EU. Auditors found the Cabinet Office's business case did not demonstrate increased impact for the proposed spending on the campaign compared with lower-cost alternatives. Auditors said it was 'not clear'it left people 'significantly better prepared'ù. The Cabinet Office, which is in charge of Brexit preparations, said it had to launch a campaign in the run-up to the October deadline or risk 'significant and unnecessary disruption'ù.The department estimated the campaign reached 99.8% of the population, with every member of the public having the opportunity to see the range of billboard, print, TV and online adverts 55 times.The campaign encouraged people and businesses to visit the government's main gov.uk website to answer questions and receive advice on preparing for the UK's exit from the bloc.Among those specifically targeted were British citizens who were intending to travel to Europe in the days and weeks after Brexit and businesses that exported to the EU.Gareth Davies, the NAO's chief executive, said: 'At short notice, the Cabinet Office successfully corralled multiple government departments to work together effectively and launched this complex campaign at great speed.'However, it is not clear that the campaign resulted in the public being significantly better prepared.'ùIn response, the government said the watchdog had acknowledged the campaign increased public awareness of the action it needed to take to be ready to leave the EU.'Not undertaking the campaign would have risked significant and unnecessary disruption to businesses and to people's lives,'a spokesperson for the cabinet office said. Responding to the report, the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said it was 'a colossal waste of taxpayers money'which was effectively part of the Conservative election campaign. 'This damning report shows what we knew all along: the Conservative government's 'òGet Ready for Brexit' campaign was an expensive propaganda stunt designed ahead of the election to help no one but Boris Johnson stay in Number 10.'Once again the Tories are misusing their powers at the expense of our democracy. Given how poorly this campaign performed it should be referred to the Electoral Commission and be included as part of the Tory general election spend,'she said. The UK will leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on Friday 31 January. ",0,Neutral

Boris Johnson's Brexit bill cleared its last hurdle after the government overturned five House of Lords amendments. The Queen gave it her royal assent, making it law, and Conservative MPs cheered the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act. In Brussels, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the European commission and council presidents, signed the withdrawal agreement with the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, in attendance. 'Things will inevitably change but our friendship will remain. We start a new chapter as partners and allies,'Michel said. After it had crossed the Channel, the British prime minister then added his signature to the agreement in Downing Street, hailing a 'fantastic moment'that he said would end years of 'argument and division'and prove a positive change for the UK: We can now move forward as one country - with a government focused on delivering better public services, greater opportunity and unleashing the potential of every corner of our brilliant United Kingdom. In Davos, however, Sajid Javid had to tone down his comments the previous week to the effect that business leaders had better get used to life outside the single market and customs union. The UK would not diverge from EU regulations 'just for the sake of it'ù, the chancellor promised. Businesses were not overly reassured: the Institute of Directors warned it needed time to prepare for a new relationship with the EU by December, and demanded the government urgently publish its objectives for the next stage of the talks (the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, later said this would happen by early February). Meanwhile, it emerged that the 'straightforward'document that Northern Irish businesses will need to complete to send goods to Great Britain after Brexit (and which Johnson has said firms can throw in the bin) was in fact a complex form that includes 31 data elements. Barnier and the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, warned in Dublin that a united EU would continue to protect its members' interests in the 'very challenging'upcoming talks. Varadkar separately told the BBC the EU was likely to have 'the upper hand'ù, and could use leverage over the financial industry to extract concessions on fishing. Pascal Canfin, a leading French MEP and close ally of the president, Emmanuel Macron, reiterated that any attempt by the British government to seek full access to European markets without alignment on core EU standards for nature protection, climate, workers' rights and state aid was 'absurd'and would be voted down. Barnier later rammed home the message, and also firmly rejected Johnson's claims that there would be no checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland after Brexit, saying the UK had agreed to them and they were 'not dispensable'ù. And British hopes of maintaining a post-Brexit flow of data with the EU, seen as vital for security and the economy, risked being jeopardised after the Netherlands raised questions over the UK's poor record in protecting personal information. Brexit Day will be celebrated by leave voters on Parliament Square in London, and a clock counting down the last hour will be projected on to No 10 Downing Street, but 31 January will not be marked by any official pageantry. As soon as the clock strikes 11pm (midnight in Brussels), the UK will no longer be a member of the EU and British citizens will no longer be EU citizens. Its 73 MEPs will no longer sit in the European parliament, British ministers will no longer sit in European council meetings. Few others will notice much difference for the time being because the UK will remain part of the single market and customs union until the end of the transition period in December, so free movement of goods, people, services and capital will apply. What happens after December 2020 remains unclear; the future relationship between the EU and its first ex-member remains to be negotiated. Much will depend on how far the UK government wants to diverge from the EU rulebook - whether or not it will abide by a 'level playing field'ù. Formal talks are likely to start in early March. David Frost, the prime minister's chief Europe adviser, will lead trade negotiations with the EU on his behalf, at the head of a 40-person taskforce reporting into Downing Street.

Brexit adviser David Frost to lead UK trade negotiations with EU,0.125,Positive,"Boris Johnson has appointed David Frost, his chief Europe adviser, to lead trade negotiations with the EU on his behalf, with no apparent role for Liz Truss, the trade secretary. Frost will be the direct counterpart of Michel Barnier, the EU's negotiator for the future relationship, with civil servant deputies from the Foreign Office and Treasury. He will lead a 40-person task force, reporting into the Johnson's Downing Street, now that the Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU) is due to shut down on 31 January. It leaves no role for Truss amid speculation her department could be rolled into the business department as part of expected changes to machinery of government next month. Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, will lose his role on Friday at 11.01pm and the DExEU civil servants are being redeployed. However, he may be handed back a job in the impending reshuffle, which is linked to changes in Whitehall departments. There is speculation the FCO may gain control of the Department for International Development, that the Department for Trade could merge into the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and that energy could be made into an independent department again. There are also rumours that the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport could be wrapped into other departments. ",0,Neutral
Fast-track 'global talent visa' to be launched days after Brexit,-0.25,Negative,"The government has announced it will launch a 'global talent visa'on 20 February to encourage scientists, researchers and mathematicians to come to the UK, with no limit on how many people can be accepted. In addition, Boris Johnson said he was making available a £300m package for research into advanced mathematics. It will double funding for new PhDs and boost the number of maths fellowships and research projects. With Brexit day approaching on 31 January, the prime minister said: 'As we leave the EU I want to send a message that the UK is open to the most talented minds in the world, and stand ready to support them to turn their ideas into reality.'The fast-track visa is a replacement of the old tier-one 'exceptional talent'visa route that allowed applicants to be endorsed by the Royal Society, Royal Academy of Engineering, the British Academy, Tech Nation or Arts Council England. Applications were previously capped at 2,000 per year but the limit was never reached. Under the new scheme, the UK Research and Innovation funding agency will also be able to recommend applicants. Applicants will not need a job offer before arriving in the UK under the visa and it will provide an accelerated path to settlement for all scientists and researchers who are endorsed. Christine Jardine, the Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokeswoman, dismissed it as a 'marketing gimmick'ù. She said: 'Boris Johnson is showing that he fundamentally doesn't understand what makes our science sector so successful. Changing the name of a visa and removing a cap that's never been hit is not a serious plan.'",0,Neutral
Brexit secretary says UK will set out trade talk aims by early February,0,Neutral,"The UK will set out its negotiating aims for trade talks with the EU by early February and will not diverge from Brussels' rules for the sake of it, Steve Barclay has said. The Brexit secretary, whose job will become defunct when the UK leaves the EU on 31 January, set a more moderate tone than some of his colleagues who insist the UK will be looking for no alignment with the EU after Brexit. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he said the broad aims for trade talks would be set out within the next month, with Boris Johnson expected to make a speech revealing his approach. Barclay said: 'The key issue is that we will have control of our rules, we will not be a rule-taker, we will not diverge for the sake of diverging, we start from a position of alignment. But the key opportunity is that we will be able to set our standards, high standards, on workers' rights, on the environment, on state aid as part of that trade policy.'He argued the UK and the EU would be able to negotiate a zero-tariff and zero-quota deal even while Britain was insisting on some degree of regulatory divergence. 'We're coming out of the single market, we're coming out of the customs union. We're not just going to diverge just for the sake of it - we need to look at where the opportunities are. 'But it is true that we are going to have control of our approach to regulation and that's the very essence of Brexit: that we can do things differently, particularly where, for example, there is innovation, there is new technologies, there's things where we want to move quickly. Brexit at its very core is that we will have control of our laws, our regulation and that is why we can't be a rule-taker. We need to have that opportunity.'Earlier, Priti Patel sounded a different note as she focused on divergence. The home secretary told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday: 'There is no disagreement in government at all: we are clear - we are leaving.  'In terms of divergence, we are not having alignment. We will be diverging. We want to take control of our laws, money and our borders. And to do that we will not be rule-takers - we will be setting our own laws and that is a fundamental feature of leaving the European Union.'Last week Sajid Javid alarmed businesses by saying in an FT interview that there would not be alignment with the EU after Brexit. The chancellor insisted firms must adjust to new regulations. However, he toned down his comments later in the week to say there would only be divergence where it made sense to do so.

'Fantastic moment': Boris Johnson signs Brexit withdrawal deal,0.25,Positive,"Boris Johnson has formally signed the EU withdrawal agreement, smiling as he described it as a 'fantastic moment'for the country. His enthusiasm came in sharp contrast to the sombre tone of EU officials, who earlier added their signatures to the document before it crossed the Channel. With a week before the deadline of 31 January, the agreement is now concluded and talks are due to begin over the future relationship between the UK and Brussels. Johnson said the document's signing, which took place in Downing Street, would end years of 'argument and division'and was a positive change for the UK. 'We can now move forward as one country - with a government focused upon delivering better public services, greater opportunity and unleashing the potential of every corner of our brilliant United Kingdom, while building a strong new relationship with the EU as friends and sovereign equals,'he said. The pictures of Johnson signing the official agreement after more than two years of negotiations came after a more sober photographic moment for Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the leaders of the European commission and council respectively. In images made available of the signing ceremony in the EU's Europa building on Friday morning, the bloc's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, can be seen standing behind the two presidents. Michel, who as president of the European council will now chair meetings of 27 rather than 28 heads of state and government at the regular summits in the Belgian capital, said in a short statement: 'Things will inevitably change but our friendship will remain. We start a new chapter as partners and allies.'Von der Leyen tweeted: 'Charles Michel and I have just signed the agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, opening the way for its ratification by the European parliament.'The signed copy of the agreement was sent in a diplomatic bag to Downing Street for the prime minister's signature. On Thursday the withdrawal agreement received royal assent from the Queen. The document, which runs to nearly 600 pages, includes agreements on citizens' rights, the UK's £33bn worth of financial obligations to the bloc and the Northern Ireland protocol, establishing the arrangements for maintaining an open border on the island of Ireland. The European parliament's constitutional affairs committee backed the agreement on Thursday by 23 votes to three, setting up the final act next week when a plenary session of the EU parliament will vote to ratify the deal. Under the agreement, the UK will leave the EU at midnight central European time on 31 January. The UK will remain in the EU's single market and customs union, but none of the decision-making bodies, until the end of 2020. Johnson has said he will not take the option available to him in the withdrawal agreement of extending this transition period. The prime minister has said the 11-month period available without further extension is 'ample'time to reach agreement on a comprehensive deal. The EU's negotiating position, known as a mandate, is due to be adopted on 25 February by EU ministers attending a general affairs council, and formal negotiations will then begin on the future relationship. A political declaration on the outlines of the future relationship, which has already been given the political seal of approval in London and the EU capitals, will set the parameters of the talks as the two negotiating teams seek to replace the terms of the UK's 45-year membership with new arrangements.

Many in the north backed Brexit. They will soon begin to feel the costs,0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson and his ministers have made huge promises for the United Kingdom after we leave the European Union next week, particularly for 'the north'- that unfamiliar land which can now be mined for Tory votes, if no longer for coal. Conservative MPs elected in former Labour strongholds have pledged to 'hunt like a pack'for infrastructure improvements - of which there has been no sign over the past decade of Tory government. The north is promised bounty from the 'shared prosperity fund'- the cynically named, back-of-an-envelope replacement for EU structural funds, which for decades have invested billions in Britain's regions to encourage economic revival. Transformation is promised for when Brexit is 'done'ù, yet there is still no acknowledgement that the most severe economic threat to the north is Brexit itself. The risks highlighted by government impact assessments - which Theresa May was so reluctant to publish - remain, with the north and Midlands facing the greatest peril due to the significance of their trade with Europe. And the chancellor Sajid Javid's insistence that Britain will diverge from EU industrial and social standards puts the risk to the regional economy at the more serious levels calculated by those assessments. Blighted as many areas have been by job losses and severe public spending cuts, it is nevertheless a caricature to depict the north and Midlands as barely rebuilt since the mines, shipbuilding and other heavy industries were dismantled under the Thatcher government in the 1980s. Efforts have been made over three decades to regenerate deindustrialised areas - including investment, consistently, from the now-disappearing EU funds that are specifically targeted at deprived areas of Europe. British policy has been patchy, never enough, and was further undermined from 2010 by Tory governments withdrawing swathes of funding, and abolishing regional development agencies. Yet the modern industries that have been established during this period, of which car manufacturing is the strongest example, have based their operations on Britain being a member of the EU. The north-east, a small region by population and still pockmarked by decline, has hosted the growth of Nissan, and the 30,000 jobs in its supply chain, since the Japanese car giant was first attracted to Sunderland in 1986. The impact assessments found that this region, with its high-quality manufacturers principally exporting to Europe, faces losing the most: an 11% hit even with a trade deal, if Johnson achieves the incredible and strikes one by the end of this year. If there is no deal, and full barriers and tariffs are erected with Europe, the projected hit is 16%. The north-west - where Leigh, Burnley and Blackpool South voted for Johnson but where there are still strong chemicals, machinery and transport export industries - faces an 8% economic decline, rising to 12% if there is no trade deal. The damage to the West Midlands, east Midlands, and Yorkshire and Humber is projected to be at least 5%, and up to 13% for the West Midlands if there's no deal. These downturns would affect companies in all sectors, putting hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk - such as in the ceramics industry, which still directly employs 22,500 people, many in its traditional Staffordshire heartland. The new year has already delivered a bracing blow to 283 steelworkers in South Yorkshire, where Liberty Speciality Steels cited 'issues around Brexit'among its difficulties when announcing the redundancies. Johnson's new MPs have gushed about knocking on doors in Sedgefield, Blyth Valley and Redcar, and finding people impatient for the Brexit they voted for in 2016. But when the MPs talk to people involved professionally in their constituencies' economic development, they will find them almost unanimously alarmed by the prospect of leaving the EU. In the north-east, the region's CBI, Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses, Entrepreneurs' Forum, Northern TUC, local authorities and its four universities signed up to a call for continued access to the single market - which seems impossible now - in order to lessen the economic damage. Nissan itself, which employs almost 8,000 people directly in Sunderland, gradually escalated the seriousness of its warnings, before saying emphatically last October that a no-deal Brexit would make its UK operation unviable. The day after Johnson's election victory, a company spokeswoman said it is 'still waiting for clarity on what the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU will look like'ù. The Japanese government has repeatedly issued similar warnings on behalf of 1,000 Japanese companies based in the UK, saying some are already halting investment and looking to move operations to Europe. A survey cited by the Nikkei Asian Review found that more than 70% of Japanese manufacturers in Britain are already 'feeling a negative impact from Brexit'ù. The efforts of UK business organisations, trades unions and other experts to explain the EU's benefits and the risks of leaving have been bulldozed by three-word slogans, preceded by years of misinformation, all gleefully fuelled by the current prime minister. He may never be held to account for that, or for his new pledges to the north, but as he now moves to get Brexit done, his promises are finally set to collide with reality.

UK could tap into Africa's $24bn market for off-grid solar power,0.125,Positive,"UK investors could seize a $24bn investment opportunity by helping to connect millions of people without access to electricity to off-grid home solar power systems. The market for pay-as-you-go home solar packages is expected to boom in Africa, where millions of homes are using mobile technology to rent low-cost solar panels. UK companies have played a leading role in helping more than five million households sign up to pay-as-you-go home solar systems in the past four years. But with 600 million people without access to an electricity grid, there is huge potential for future investment. A report by Kleos Advisory, published during the first UK-Africa Investment Summit in London, has found that the commercial opportunity from off-grid solar panels could generate about $24bn (£18bn) a year. The market is growing rapidly since the collapse in the cost of solar panel technologies and the emergence of mobile banking and affordable financing in the continent's fast-growing economies. Households that earn an income are increasingly using mobile phones to rent small-scale solar panels, and ultra-efficient electric lighting strips and appliances to access electricity for the first time. Once the solar panels are paid off, households own the equipment outright and in effect have free energy. Many then choose to upgrade their packages to add televisions and electric cookers. The off-grid solar market is expected to grow rapidly, in part because eight of the world's 15 fastest-growing economies are in Africa. Tedd George, the author of the report, said the combination of solar technology and affordable financing was 'driving an economic transformation in Africa, making the 'òunbankable' bankable and embedding African consumers in the digital economy'ù. UK companies including Azuri Technologies, which commissioned the report, and Bboxx are racing to corner the market for off-grid solar in Africa with the help of private investment and major international companies. Azuri sells its home solar systems in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Nigeria, and Bboxx is active in Kenya, Togo, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Mali, Rwanda, Senegal, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria. The scale of the off-grid solar market across Africa has emerged as UK investment leaders consider future investment in the continent after Brexit. Tony Blair said the summit this week 'should open a new chapter in Britain's relationship with Africa'to one based on 'economic cooperation rather than simply an aid-based, donor-recipient relationship'ù. The former Labour prime minister said: 'If we can use the UK-Africa Investment Summit to become a true economic partner to African countries, it would be of great strategic benefit to the continent and to the UK.'",0,Neutral
"Never mind getting Brexit 'òdone'. For civil servants, the work is about to begin",-0.25,Negative,"We will finally leave the European Union on 31 January. Big Ben won't toll after all, but a giant clock will be projected on to No 10. Some will celebrate; some will mourn. And the government seems to hope that we will breathe a collective sigh of relief and then move on. It's almost as if Brexit has become a distraction, something to be got out of the way. The next five years, we are assured, will be about other things. It's true that Brexit may not dominate the headlines in quite the way it has done over the last few years. But even if the surface remains calm, beneath it there will be a whole lot of furious paddling. For Brexit will be the dominant driver of the underlying business of this government. Its handling of Brexit is more likely than anything else to define its legacy. A change as profound as our exit from the EU, for good or ill, entails huge and lasting consequences for this country; we are really only now, finally, at the starting gate for sorting out what that will mean. The impact of this change will reverberate deep into government. This is without doubt the greatest challenge the British civil service has faced in a generation. The scale is vast: the negotiation of our future relationship with the EU will, in its totality, be the biggest negotiation ever undertaken by the UK. Alongside the EU deal, the government will be pushing hard to demonstrate at least one of the hoped-for opportunities of Brexit by concluding trade deals with other countries. Each trade negotiation will be a complex deal in its own right, and the interaction between any one of these and the EU negotiations will take forensic coordination, as well as hard political choices. Brexit will require significant change to the UK legal order and regulatory state, not least as the UK civil service and UK regulatory agencies pick up the responsibilities previously managed from Brussels. The more the government wants to diverge from EU regulation, the more complex this agenda becomes. On the economic front, new trade barriers with our major trading partner will make thousands of UK businesses less competitive in their main market. Whitehall will have to be agile and smart to work out how to counteract this drag on the government's ambition to invigorate growth rates across the UK. Brexit will require a recalibration of the UK's diplomatic outreach. Whether that's re-establishing British credentials in international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, boosting missions in Brussels and elsewhere in the EU or adjusting our relationship with other trading partners, this will require substantial additional commitment of resources and diplomatic capital. Within the UK itself, Brexit complicates the functioning of our own internal market, as the devolved governments take up the powers in devolved areas, such as agriculture, fisheries and the environment, that were previously managed from Brussels. Alongside the byzantine complexities of the Northern Ireland deal, Whitehall will have to re-engineer its relationship with the devolved governments to ensure the UK internal market is not compromised through the emergence of different standards on different sides of the UK's internal borders. That will require agreement between the four governments of the UK to work together. All this will require more civil servants - one of the unintended consequences of Brexit. There are already more than 25,000 civil servants working on Brexit, and that number will rise as we actually leave the EU. But the civil service will certainly be up for the challenge. There will be some nervousness about what lies ahead - and some disruption if the government carries through its reported plans for major changes in the way departments are structured. We know that my old department, the Department for Exiting the EU, is due for the chop at the end of the month. Handled well, this will release the brilliant capability built up in DExEU to support Brexit-related work across government. But it will be critically important to retain a sufficient cadre of DExEU officials who have deep knowledge of the EU machine and Brexit and all it entails at the centre of government to help coordinate what will be an immensely complicated negotiation with the EU. The civil service will cope with that disruption of structural change and get on with the work it has to do. The notion that it has somehow dragged its feet on Brexit is nonsense. I know from my own experience in DExEU of the huge commitment made by thousands of civil servants across government to drive forward the mammoth task of getting us ready for Brexit. The jamming of the process through political paralysis was just as frustrating for civil servants as it was for the rest of the country. After three and a half years of intensive engagement with Brexit, the civil service has a pretty good idea of the massive task that lies ahead. The same may not be true of many in the political class or the country more generally. Brexit done on 31 January? Yes - but only in a literal, legal sense. The truth is, we're just getting started.

The government has offered no justification for pursuing a hard Brexit,0,Neutral,"Estimates of the economic cost of a hard Brexit vary, but it is generally agreed that this form of Brexit will be much more economically damaging than one where the UK seeks close alignment with the EU, its biggest trading partner.  How does Sajid Javid and the entire Johnson government justify the hard Brexit it so evidently embraces (Brexit: Javid comments on non-alignment with EU prompt warnings of price rises, 18 January)? How will a race to the bottom serve the common good, or benefit business? To which EU regulations does the government take exception, and why? Andrea Leadsom has reduced weekly contact with the UK's five largest business groups to a monthly meeting with a wider group. This is how our government regards business. It is prepared to sacrifice jobs, and our common interests, on the altar of its ideology. It knows that certain business sectors will face an existential threat because of its policy, and it claims that they have had since 2016 to prepare for it. We need to know who will benefit from this government policy, and how. The government should be continually challenged to justify its approach. It isn't enough for minsters to tell business there will be no alignment. It needs to say why. It needs to explain how Britain will prosper by turning its back on its major trading partner. It needs to explain how Britain can prosper as a single nation in a world of increasing protectionism. Every MP must act in the nation's best interests. The government needs to justify the economic and human loss that its approach is bound to deliver. It has not done so, except in the vaguest of terms, and with slogans and soundbites. There are two words that strike terror in the heart of Johnson's government: honesty and transparency. It's time for both.Adrian BaskervilleSoberton, Hampshire '¢ Sajid Javid is naive to claim that 'we will not be a rule taker'ù. In a trade deal with the US, he must expect that it will dictate which standards apply. We should learn from the Canadians' painful experience of trade deals with the US. Anyone who thinks EU regulations are an assault on the sovereignty of the UK should brace themselves for the 'brave new world'of Johnson's and Javid's trade deal with the US.Peter SwannEmeritus professor of industrial economics, University of Nottingham '¢ What will happen in so many areas of our lives after Brexit is anyone's guess. A gentle transition so we all end up wondering what all the fuss was about, or chaos on the roads with trucks queuing for hours and indecision and panic in boardrooms across the land. My confusion was only confounded by the chancellor's statement that we will no longer be aligned with EU regulations and standards after Brexit. A big question for many of us is what EU regulations are to be retained? Will we be inundated with US chlorine-soaked chicken? Will we have to search labels for the dreaded phrase 'genetically modified'ù? Will we adhere to the EU regulations on climate change and workers' rights? According to the House of Commons library, the EU Withdrawal Act means that 'In practice the UK is retaining EU regulations, decisions and tertiary legislation and elements of the EEA agreement (as they existed on exit day).'My understanding is that parliament will, in due course, consider which of the EU regulations and laws should become UK domestic law. So it seems that we must wait to see the result of deliberations in parliament before we know the true implications of leaving the EU. Only time will tell.Eileen PeckBenfleet, Essex '¢ Sajid Javid insists that there will be short-term problems but the UK will be in a better position in the long term if we exclude any alignment with the EU after Brexit. Sadly, people eat food and use medicines in the short term. When people lose their jobs, telling them the UK will be better off in the long term is not helpful when the ensuing poverty means they are no longer able to put food on the table. Where will the jobs come from if we cannot access the market that accounts for over 40% of our trade? How far away is the long term? How do we survive the short term while waiting to arrive at the long term? We are heading towards the economic buffers just as there is a real prospect of a worldwide recession.

What delights will be laid on for a joyful nation at the forthcoming Festival of Brexit?,0,Neutral,"Perhaps all anyone needs to know about the Festival of Brexit, which really is going to take place in 2022, is that its earliest recorded champion is Jacob Rees-Mogg. Love Jacob, scourge of the liberal metropolitan elite, and you'll love his idea of fun. 'A Festival of Brexit would be excellent,'he said, early in 2018. 'There should be a huge celebration and in the spirit of friendship of our European neighbours we should drink lots of champagne to say that although we may be leaving the European Union, we don't dislike Europe.'And the brand? Unspecified, though for peers we know Mogg insists on 'the highest quality'ù. Despite the best efforts of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), which subsequently renamed the Moggfest a 'Festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'ù, then, yet more hygienically, Festival 2022, the earlier name appears, being accurate, to have stuck. So the principal task for its newly appointed director, the event professional Martin Green, will be selling the fiction that a crass, xenophobic, hideously timed and inherently divisive event, conceived of purely as a trumpeting of the country's Moggian - ie immigrant and metropolitan elite-free - destiny, can also bring us, as Green puts it, 'joy and hope and community'ù. You almost feel for Green (whose track record includes, as well as his Olympic hiring of Danny Boyle, the tragicomic Beijing segment featuring a red bus and Boris Johnson). Even the managers of the Millennium Dome, that monument to all doomed national festivities, were never asked to separate the endeavour from the year 2000. Nobody asked Green, when he supervised Hull's time as City of Culture, if he wouldn't mind staging it in Huddersfield (though actually, for poorer people in Hull, that might not have made much difference). But the great You Lost Get Over It Festival could also, we gather, be about 'healing and coming together'ù. How? 'Of course, I'm not the one who is going to answer the question,'Green has said. 'The great creatives of this country will.'Come in, then, any individuals who recognise themselves in Dominic Cummings's recent caricature: 'Oxbridge English graduates who chat about Lacan at dinner parties with TV producers and spread fake news about fake news.'You're needed to clean up after his buses. Perhaps the metropolitan elite really does abound in great creatives who are willing, desperate or privately Brexity enough to stage a national triumph over the metropolitan elite. They might be able to re-enact some battle or other, what with Noel Gallagher, Roger Daltrey, Michael Caine and £120m for fireworks. Imagine, too, a massive blue passport on the fourth plinth; dog shows in every abandoned library; a new Wetherspoon literary prize for the novel that most helps readers - NB Ian McEwan - take pride in Britain. Other great creatives may believe, more honourably, that they can ignore or transcend the politics, endure Remainer insults about bread and circuses and finally supply experiences more reminiscent of the impressive, often intensely moving events that commemorated, over five years, the centenary of the First World War. Researchers at British Future have commended, as a model for the new festival, that project's 'reach and resonance across different sections of society, crossing divides by politics, geography, age, ethnicity and class'ù. But given the government's determination - against British Future's advice - to celebrate its triumph in 2022, the anniversary of Irish partition, amid continuing post-Brexit divisions and disintegration, similar divide-crossing would demand unprecedented levels of creative genius. Nobody, not even the miserabilist cynics ritually denounced by professional choreographers of national pride, objected to remembrances for the war dead. How many of the disappointed 48%, however resigned to the outcome, will welcome the chance to forget old principles and come together with Mark Francois? How shall we celebrate our losses of citizenship? Would it help if the Queen parachuted in? What brilliant cultural intervention - be it theatre, exhibition or a volunteer army - will transform the end of free movement, a stalled economy, shrivelling union, international ridicule and the extinction of the postwar European dream, into something as cynic-crushing as Danny Boyle's Isles of Wonder? The new James Bond? If the squabbles over bell ringing have served any purpose, it's surely as a hint to the DCMS officials obediently bleating about 'a moment of national celebration'that will 'help attract new inward business and investment'to learn, while there's time, from an earlier misadventure in 'arts, culture, design and tech'ù: the dome. Its begetter, Michael Heseltine, talked up 'selling ourselves and our country'ù. The heritage minister, Virginia Bottomley, said: 'It will unite the nation.'Tony Blair, having aggressively defended the indefensible, later regretted not building a hospital instead: 'It wasn't really a suitable project for government.'But the aptest warning may be the event's opposite, Fanfare for Britain, devised, in defiance of political dissent, to celebrate Britain's entry into the Common Market. The programme, including a Covent Garden gala, football and a 'Miss TV Europe'contest, also anticipated current demands on the church: a controversial service of thanksgiving was staged in Coventry cathedral. 'The Fanfare was a flop,'writes Robert Saunders in Yes to Europe. 'Wembley Stadium was half empty, events were sparsely attended and the government was accused of squandering £350,000 of public money. Opinion polls, which had shown a slender majority for entry in January, quickly turned sour.'That a more skilful generation of planners may surmount similar challenges cannot, however, detoxify the new project. Throughout Johnson's leadership campaign, supporters cited, as though it were some prized premiership indicator, his alleged Olympic feats: ie he was mayor when Danny Boyle delivered on an earlier achievement by New Labour, specifically by Tessa Jowell. Supposing they can frustrate Rees-Mogg, dodge jingoism and deliver an intelligent, non-embarrassing, basically Brexit-free Festival of Brexit, the great creatives in question will find that this doubles, like it or not, as a triumphal arch for Boris Johnson.

Brexit: Javid comments on non-alignment with EU prompt warnings of price rises,-0.375,Negative,"Businesses have predicted price rises after the UK chancellor, Sajid Javid, said there would be no alignment with EU regulations once Britain's exit from the European Union was made official. In what is being seen as an opening salvo in the next stage of negotiations, Javid said the Treasury would not lend support to manufacturers that favour EU rules as the sector had had three years to prepare for Britain's transition. In an interview with the Financial Times, he said: 'There will not be alignment, we will not be a rule taker, we will not be in the single market and we will not be in the customs union - and we will do this by the end of the year. 'We're '¶ talking about companies that have known since 2016 that we are leaving the EU.'His remarks will be seen as confirmation of a strategic departure from Theresa May's deal in which she envisaged close alignment with the EU, in an effort to reduce friction at the border for traders. But they will alarm business leaders in key sectors including car manufacturing and agriculture who fear the price of non-alignment will be more complex trade barriers for those who export and import with the rest of the EU. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) on Saturday said alignment supported jobs and competitiveness for many firms. The group's director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, said business 'recognises there are areas where the UK can benefit from its future right to diverge from EU regulation'but urged government 'not to treat this right as an obligation to diverge'ù. 'For some firms, divergence brings value, but for many others, alignment supports jobs and competitiveness - particularly in some of the most deprived regions of the UK,'she said. The co-executive director of the British Chamber of Commerce, Claire Walker, said that while business communities were prepared to be pragmatic about coming changes to regulation, 'uncertainty around the extent of divergence risks firms moving their production elsewhere'ù. 'The government must clearly communicate these changes in a timely way and provide substantial support to help firms adapt,'Walker added. 'Otherwise they will struggle to make the most of new opportunities as Britain sets its own trading policies.'The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said Javid's remarks showed Tory promises were 'not worth [the] paper they were written on'ù. In a tweet, he added: 'Fears now made real about food price increases and threats to jobs in motor industry and manufacturing. Right ideology overriding common sense.'Labour MP David Lammy described it as a 'disaster for business'ù. 'It's catastrophic for workers and the public services which depend on them too. Brexit will hurt most those communities it claimed to help,'he said. Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy conmittee, described Javid and the government's new position as 'more nonsense'ù, adding: 'Of course we need a high degree of alignment with our closest trading partners.'Javid once said the UK's best economic place was to remain in the EU and the single market. In May 2016, a month before the referendum he said the only thing guaranteed about leaving the bloc was a decade of 'stagnation and doubt'ù. 'Just like the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and IMF head Christine Lagarde, I still believe that Britain is better off in. And that's all because of the single market. 'It's a great invention, one that even Lady Thatcher campaigned enthusiastically to create. The world's largest economic bloc, it gives every business in Britain access to 500 million customers with no barriers, no tariffs and no local legislation to worry about,'he said in an article in the Daily Telegraph. Last week the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, warned that the price of non-alignment would be friction in trade. 'The more divergence there is, the more distant the partnership has to be,'she said. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator has also warned that the UK will not get a tariff-free, quota-free trade deal with the EU unless it accepts level-playing field rules on issues such as the environment. Javid admitted that some businesses may not benefit from Brexit, but added that the UK economy would ultimately continue to thrive in the long term. 'Once we've got this agreement in place with our European friends, we will continue to be one of the most successful economies on Earth,'he said. But the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said that no regulatory alignment with the EU after Brexit could lead to price rises. Its chief operating officer, Tim Rycroft, said the chancellor's comments represented 'the death knell for frictionless trade'ù. He told the BBC Today programme on Saturday: 'Food and drink manufacturers will be deeply concerned by the chancellor's suggestion that there will not be regulatory alignment with the EU post-Brexit. 'It will mean businesses will have to adjust to costly new checks, processes and procedures, that will act as a barrier to frictionless trade with the EU and may well result in price rises.'Chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, Mike Hawes, also expressed concern: 'Automotive trade between the UK and EU is uniquely integrated and our priority is to avoid expensive tariffs and other 'òbehind the border' barriers that limit market access.'He said the car industry needed as early sight as possible of the government's objectives given the potential disruption involved. Javid will have the opportunity to sell his vision for Britain's economy after Brexit when he travels to Davos next week for the World Economic Forum. Negotiations on the future relationship are expected to begin formally after 25 February when the EU has formally agreed its negotiating goals. It is not clear whether the UK will publish detailed negotiating objectives, which is the convention in trade talks. Javid was upbeat about the economy, saying he wanted to boost growth rates to between 2.7% and 2.8% a year - the average for 50 years after the second world war. But last week, Carney told the FT he thought Britain's trend growth rate was much lower at between 1% and 1.5% . ",0,Neutral
Boris Johnson saves face over failed bid for Big Ben Brexit chime,0.5,Positive,"Boris Johnson has announced plans to project a giant clock face on to Downing Street on the evening of 31 January, in a bid to move on after a backlash over his failure to get Big Ben to bong for Brexit. Diehard Brexiters, including Conservative MP Mark Francois and Brexit party MEP Richard Tice, had reacted furiously to news that Big Ben would not ring out to mark the UK officially quitting the EU at the end of this month. Francois said earlier in the week that it was 'inconceivable'that 'the most iconic timepiece on Earth, which is Big Ben'ù, should not be used to mark Brexit. Asked about the controversy on Tuesday, the prime minister said the government was 'working up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong'ù. Several crowdfunders were set up to help raise money, one of which had amassed more than £227,000 by Friday afternoon. But in an increasingly heated and farcical atmosphere, it subsequently transpired that the government had no such plan, and the House of Commons commission had no way of accepting public donations. In a bid to draw a line under the row, No 10 has now arranged a light show, featuring a clock counting down the minutes until 11pm - midnight Brussels time - when Britain will formally leave the European Union. Union flags will fly in parliament square, the scene of lively pro- and anti-Brexit protests over many months; and a commemorative coin will finally go into circulation - a previous iteration having been melted down, when Brexit was postponed. Government buildings on Whitehall will also be lit up for the occasion, and Johnson will deliver a televised address to mark the moment. The costs of the celebration will be borne by the taxpayer. Despite Johnson having won the Tory leadership with the backing of hardline Brexiters and expunging many moderates from his party, he now insists he is keen to heal the divisions between leavers and remainers. The row about Big Ben's bongs has raged all week. The House of Commons commission, which organises the running of parliament, had said the bell was 'unlikely'to sound at 11pm on 31 January, the moment Brexit officially happens, in part due to the estimated cost of £500,000 to make it happen. Work needed would have included restoring the clock chime mechanism, testing it, building a temporary floor in the belfry to allow the work to take place and delaying other restoration work for several weeks. The new Speaker of the Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, who chairs the commission, said, 'you're looking at £50,000 a bong'ù. The cabinet will meet outside London on the week of 31 January, in a bid to highlight the government's plans for 'levelling-up'regions outside London - and throw the focus forward to the future. Johnson will claim that the UK's formal departure from the EU at the end of this month fulfils his election pledge to 'get Brexit done'ù. But it also marks the start of a race against time to secure a free trade agreement with the EU27 in time for the end of the transition period, in December. The withdrawal agreement bill, which incorporates the Brexit deal struck by Johnson in Brussels last November, has been making rapid progress through parliament since the Conservatives won an 80-seat majority at last month's general election.

Downing Street kills off plans for Big Ben Brexit bong,0,Neutral,"The hopes of diehard Brexiters to hear the chimes of Big Ben sound at the moment the UK leaves the EU appear to have finally been dashed by Downing Street, as it indicated this will not happen even if the public raises the £500,000 needed to pay for it. According to Boris Johnson's spokesman, Commons authorities - who warned on Tuesday of the high cost of completing the complex restoration of the clocktower - have said there could be difficulties in accepting public donations. On Tuesday, the prime minister said the government was 'working up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong'ù. However, it transpired that there was no such plan, and the House of Commons Commission, which organises the running of parliament, said the bell was 'unlikely'to sound at 11pm on 31 January, the moment Brexit officially happens, in part due to the estimated cost of £500,000 to make it happen. Work needed would include restoring the clock chime mechanism, testing it, building a temporary floor in the belfry to allow the work to take place and delaying other restoration work for several weeks. After it emerged that No 10 had no mechanism to raise the money, several crowdfunding pages were set up, and one of these has so far raised nearly £70,000. But speaking on Thursday, Johnson's spokesman indicated the Brexiters' dream seemed doomed even if the sum was raised. 'The House of Commons authorities have set out that there may be particular difficulties in accepting money from public donations,'he said. 'The PM's focus is on the events which he and the government are planning to mark 31 January.'Asked if people should thus not bother giving to the crowdfunder, he replied: 'I'm just reflecting that the parliamentary authorities have set out some potential problems and our focus is on the events that the government is currently working on.'Downing Street has promised to unveil a package of events to mark Brexit, but has yet to give any details. The programme is expected to be relatively low-key, with an emphasis on avoiding perceived triumphalism on what is still a hugely divisive issue. ",0.125,Positive
"900,000 EU citizens in UK yet to apply for settled status",0.25,Positive,"An estimated 900,000 EU citizens in the UK have yet to apply for settled status, which most will need to remain in the country long-term after Brexit. The data comes a day after the European parliament raised concerns that EU citizens risked discrimination after Brexit in seeking housing and employment. Home Office statistics for December show that just over 2.7 million EU citizens and their family members have applied for settled status, a special immigration category set up for nationals from member states. The figures underline a huge take-up of the scheme, which was launched nationally in March 2019, but also show the scale of the task that still lies ahead for the Home Office. Although there is no official data on how many EU citizens live in the UK, it is estimated to be between 3 million and 3.6 million. The Liberal Democrats said the figures raised concerns as they showed 'more than 1 million EU citizens have now been given the weaker pre-settled status'which is allocated to those who have been in the UK less than five years. Lawyers have raised concerns that the Home Office may be issuing pre-settled status by default to some citizens who do not, at first glance, seem to qualify for settled status. They have urged EU citizens not to accept pre-settled status, under which they can reapply for settled status, if they have been in the country for longer than five years. The Lib Dem home affairs spokeswoman, Christine Jardine, said: 'Boris Johnson promised to automatically guarantee their rights in law, but today's figures show that his government's settled status scheme is anything but automatic. 'Unless the government changes course, tens of thousands of EU citizens will be left without legal rights in less than 18 months - at risk of eviction, detention and deportation.'Nicolas Hatton, the co-founder of the 3million campaign group, said: 'It's infuriating to see Brandon Lewis gloating about the number of applicants, while refusing to address the main issue of vulnerable EU citizens facing the full force of the law if they do not manage to apply successfully by the June 2021 deadline.'Lewis, the security minister, said he was pleased with the response to the scheme and urged EU members to put the same effort into guaranteeing the status of British nationals living in their countries beyond Brexit. He said of EU citizens in the UK: 'The UK is their home and the EU settlement scheme has already granted status to 2.5 million people so they can stay. 'We have done more than other EU member states to support EU citizens and it's time other countries made the same generous offer to the million UK nationals who live among them.'EU nationals have until June next year to apply to the Home Office for settled status (SS). According to the data, just over 300,000 of the 2,756,100 people who applied for settled status, are still waiting for a conclusion from the Home Office. EU nationals have until June next year to apply to the Home Office. So far, 58% of applicants were granted settled status and 41% were granted the more precarious pre-settled status, which allows people to stay in the UK for a further five years. The Home Office said six applications were refused on suitability grounds. EU fears over the future of its citizens in the UK after Brexit have mounted since Lewis told a German newspaper last October that EU nationals risked being deported if they failed to apply for settled status.

"Britain's EU citizens 'òat risk of discrimination' after Brexit, say MEPs",-0.25,Negative,"The European parliament has said EU citizens living in the UK after it leaves the bloc risk discrimination in jobs and housing, because the government will not issue physical documents under the settled-status scheme. In a resolution backed by a resounding majority of MEPs in Strasbourg, the parliament said the British government's 'conflicting announcements'about special status had caused 'unhelpful uncertainty and anxiety'for EU nationals who had made the UK their home. EU fears have mounted since the Home Office minister Brandon Lewis told a German newspaper last October that EU nationals risk being deported if they fail to apply for special status, the scheme to secure their rights as UK residents, by the end of 2020. MEPs are especially worried about the design of settled status, an e-registration system, which does not provide EU27 nationals with papers or ID cards. The absence of documents, the resolution said, increased the risk of discrimination against EU27 nationals by prospective employers or landlords 'who may want to avoid the extra administrative burden of online verification or erroneously fear they might place themselves in an unlawful situation'ù. One parliament source said the absence of physical documents spelled 'complete Windrush trouble for citizens' rights'ù, a reference to the scandal in which Commonwealth-born citizens were denied work, healthcare, benefits and even deported to countries they hardly knew, despite spending decades as tax-paying legal residents of the UK. The EU is also concerned about a decision by Boris Johnson's government to change the design of the independent monitoring authority, which is being created under the withdrawal agreement to safeguard the rights of EU citizens. The parliament said the government needed to ensure that the authority would be 'truly independent'and up and running on the first day after the UK leaves the transition period. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told MEPs on Tuesday that the European commission would be 'particularly alert'to difficulties in obtaining the new residency status. 'I have and will continue to insist in particular on the importance of the UK putting into place a strong independent monitoring authority,'he said. 'An authority that must be able to act rapidly and fairly when faced with complaints of [European]Union citizens and their families.'The resolution was passed with 610 votes, including those of British Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green MEPs. Only 29 MEPs voted against, mostly members of Nigel Farage's Brexit party. A further 68 MEPs abstained, including British Conservative MEPs. The government, which has launched a multi-million-pound advertising blitz intended to show the ease of securing settled status, had received nearly 2.6m applications by the end of November. More than 2.3m of those cases had been concluded, with 59% granted settled status and 41% granted pre-settled status, a category that applies to EU nationals who have lived in the UK for under five years. Pre-settled status gives people the same rights to live and work in the UK, but means they must reapply for settled status and maintain continuous residence. Only five applicants have so far been turned down for any form of status. UK government sources argue that the scheme has been unfairly criticised; they have highlighted the contrast between the cost-free UK process and the three-figure charges facing UK nationals trying to secure their rights in some EU member states. The withdrawal agreement does not require the UK government to give papers or ID cards to EU27 nationals, and government sources say discrimination by employers or landlords would be illegal. The European parliament also pledged to monitor the situation for 1.2 million British residents in the EU. Many face a slew of bureaucratic hurdles, such as minimum income requirements for self-employed people, costs and charges of getting documents, as well as uncertainty about their status because of delays after applications. Barnier said the commission would do its 'utmost to ensure that the rights of 1 million British citizens living in the 27 member states are guaranteed; that each and everyone of them is properly informed and supported'ù. The MEPs have also urged EU leaders to explore 'how to mitigate'UK citizens' loss of EU citizenship rights. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament's Brexit coordinator, has previously urged a special EU citizenship scheme for British nationals, but the idea has been dismissed by decision-makers as a political and constitutional non-starter. Verhofstadt has called on MEPs to back the Brexit withdrawal agreement, the final legal step in Britain's formal EU exit. He released his formal recommendation on Wednesday, advising MEPs to back the deal on 29 January. 'The withdrawal of the UK is a regrettable moment for the European Union and for our integration process, but we can only respect the sovereign decision of the British people,'the text stated. It added that the divorce agreement 'organises the separation with the less [sic] harm possible for both parties'ù.  A Home Office spokesperson said: 'We have done far more [for EU citizens] than any other EU member state has done for British citizens, and it's time they adopted a similarly generous approach. We have already provided certainty to 2.5 million people who have been granted status through the EU settlement scheme. It's free, there's plenty of support available, and it provides a secure digital status, which can't be lost, stolen or tampered with.'",0,Neutral
"UK-US trade deal under threat unless Iran stance changes, says Trump ally",0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson risks jeopardising a free-trade deal with the US unless he pulls the UK out of the Iran nuclear deal, a leading Republican voice on Iran has said. The warning by Richard Goldberg, until last week a member of the White House national security council (NSC), highlights the dilemmas UK foreign and defence policymakers will face as Britain tries to steer its own course between Washington and Brussels after Brexit. Goldberg told the BBC: 'The question for prime minister Johnson is: 'òAs you are moving towards Brexit, as your supporters of Brexit really do not like the nuclear deal, want you to get out of the nuclear deal '¶ what are you going to do post-31 January as you come to Washington to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the United States?''Goldberg, who was in charge of countering Iranian weapons of mass destruction at the NSC, said: 'It's absolutely in his interests and the people of Great Britain's interests to join with President Trump, with the United States, to realign your foreign policy away from Brussels, and to join the maximum pressure campaign to keep all of us safe.'He made his remarks after France, Germany and the UK agreed to put the Iran deal into its dispute-resolution mechanism, the first step towards an eventual European withdrawal from the deal. But the three European countries stressed the move was designed to persuade Iran back into compliance and rescue the deal from collapse. Johnson had caused controversy hours ahead of the announcement by calling for a 'Trump deal'to replace the nuclear deal, but the Foreign Office said afterwards the prime minister was only advocating the replacement of the existing deal if Washington and Iran were able to negotiate a better one. Trump said in a tweet that he saw Johnson as backing his strategy.  The episode highlights how Johnson will have to straddle the conflicting pressures from Europe and Washington in search of an independent yet relevant foreign policy. The most immediate point of pressure is Iran, but a succession of other issues confront the prime minister. The US is not averse to using its considerable bargaining muscle by linking what appear separate issues. Washington wants the UK to abandon the nuclear deal and reapply economic sanctions. Once outside the EU, the UK will formally be able to apply its own sanctions but the practical impact on Iran will be minimal since US penalties are already so vast and are imposed extra-territorially requiring EU firms to comply. A UK rejection of the deal would also be a rejection of what Europe has seen not only as a triumph of multilateral diplomacy but also that Iran is more likely to reform through engagement than capitulate through 'the catastrophic success'of sanctions. The UK believes hardliners are boosted by external pressure, not weakened. A crunch point may come in October when the UN has to renew an arms embargo on Iran, something China and Russia will veto. The opportunity to negotiate a UK-US trade deal may be dependent on the completion of Brexit but talks are under way. US officials have learned to say in the election that healthcare and food standards are off the table, but the ease of the talks will depend on the wider political relationships. The US will also be watching to see how much the UK aligns itself in broader regulatory terms with the EU as it would like to see the weakening of the EU as a trading bloc. A deregulated Singapore-on-Thames may not be Johnson's goal, but many Republicans would welcome a competitor to the EU. US officials this week sent a fresh warning to the UK saying it would be nothing short of madness for the UK 5G infrastructure to be tied to the Chinese state-linked technology firm Huawei. Decisions are imminent in the UK and across Europe. Senior officials in Washington have repeatedly said that the Trump administration would reassess intelligence sharing with the UK in light of such a move. It has been reported that the chancellor of the exchequer, Sajid Javid, a key swing vote in the cabinet, has some influence behind the Chinese tie-up. The US could press the issue through sanctions - its foreign policy weapon of choice - with Congress looking to raise the threshold before US firms can trade with Huawei. At the same time, China has threatened counter-sanctions against countries that make arbitrary decisions to exclude Huawei technology. The UK is due to join five other European countries by unilaterally introducing its own digital services tax on largely US internet firms in April, a further point of confrontation. France is in the frontline of this battle as its equivalent law is already in force and the US has threatened retaliatory tariffs. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, is due to hold talks with his US counterpart at the Davos summit next week and is prepared to shelve his own tax, but only if the US will swing behind a worldwide tax on tech firms. If France and the US cannot reach an agreement, the UK will either have to back down on its own plan or find itself in line for punitive US tariffs. ",-0.125,Negative
Brexit weekly briefing: UK and EU all smiles but faultlines obvious,0.625,Positive,"Welcome to the Guardian's weekly Brexit briefing, which, after more than three and a half years and nearly 170 instalments, will be landing in your inbox for the very last time on 4 February, after Britain formally leaves the EU. Full live and daily coverage of the negotiations on the future relationship between the bloc and its first ex-member will, of course, continue in the Guardian as talks advance, while our Brexit Means '¶ podcast will provide monthly in-depth insights. As Britain gradually disengages from the EU, the Guardian's European coverage will be developing and deepening. In the meantime, tap into the continental conversation on our Europe Now pages here, and subscribe to our fortnightly Europe newsletter. Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen had a 'positive'exploratory meeting on the next round of Brexit talks, making a concerted effort to put the divisions of the past three years behind them. The new president of the European commission said the two sides should focus on mutual interests, and both leaders reportedly agreed that there could be common ground on the climate crisis, human rights and security. But the British prime minister, who has made it clear he does not want the UK to remain aligned with EU rules and regulations, said he was aiming for a fast Canada-style free trade agreement and would not be requesting an extension to the transition period. Von der Leyen said in a speech before the meeting that such a timeframe was essentially impossible if Britain wanted a comprehensive agreement, and reiterated that the UK would not be allowed to have its cake and eat it: The more divergence there is, the more distant the partnership has to be. Without free movement of people, you cannot have free movement of capital, goods and services. Without a level playing field on environment, labour, taxation and state aid, you cannot have highest-quality access to the world's largest single market. Meanwhile, the prime minister's Brexit bill cleared the House of Commons, passing at third reading by a majority of 330 to 231 and heading to the House of Lords, where peers could give it a more challenging hearing but are unlikely to block its passage. But in signs of potential problems ahead, MEP's expressed 'grave concern'about the UK government's attitude to the 3.3 million EU citizens in Britain, and the UK was accused of behaving 'like a bunch of cowboys'after a confidential EU report accused it of 'deliberate violations and abuse'of the Schengen Information System database. Croatia's prime minister, Andrej Plenkoviƒá, whose country is taking over the presidency of the EU, said the EU would block the City's access to EU markets if Johnson tried to exempt the UK from its laws, while Northern Ireland's new customs arrangements would not be ready by the end of the year, an expert report said, exposing the UK to EU legal action. The Johnson-Von der Leyen meeting may have been all smiles but the faultlines - and not just over the impossibility of reaching a comprehensive deal covering all aspects of the future relationship in just 11 months - are clear: By the end of June, the EU will need to unilaterally decide on equivalence in 26 areas in the financial services sector in order to allow the City to continue to operate largely as it does today for EU clients The British fishing industry wants radical change from the common fisheries policy under which nearly 60% of fish in UK waters is caught by EU-based boats; the large European fishing nations insist on their historical rights of access. A 'zero tariff, zero quotas'deal on goods will require UK alignment with EU environmental, labour, social and state aid rules, which Johnson has rejected. Von der Leyen made clear the alternative implies fundamental change for the UK car and pharmaceutical industries.  'Festival of Brexit'boss says £120m event will prove cynics wrong. UK 'committed'to maintaining Erasmus+ exchange scheme. Brexit 'deepening inequalities among UK nationals in France'ù. MPs vote to drop child refugee protections from Brexit bill. Brexit: Australian trade minister 'can't imagine'visa-free travel deal with UK. EU trade chief foresees 'financial services for fishing'Brexit bargain. In the Guardian, Mujtaba Rahman identifies the two major stumbling blocks ahead and argues a low-alignment deal now seems likely but comes with great risks: First, Downing Street insists it will not extend the transition in any circumstances. The EU's 27 member states will only agree on the commission's mandate to negotiate on their behalf by the end of February. The cabinet and Whitehall will also need time to settle on a final policy. Ratification of the deal will probably take two to three months. In a best-case scenario, that leaves March to September - seven months - to strike an agreement. It's an understatement to suggest this might not be long enough '¶ The challenge Johnson is setting himself is immense. The risk of a no-deal cliff edge at the end of the year will remain a key concern. Second, many at the top of government see diverging from EU rules as the big prize of Brexit. While legislation enshrining existing EU standards in the areas of workers' rights and the environment is likely, it's doubtful this government will agree to follow EU rules in the future. Could Johnson prove more pragmatic? Perhaps, but probably only when talks reach a climax in the autumn. The government could be tempted to follow EU rules in sectors such as aerospace, pharmaceuticals and chemicals. But this is not a given. A scrappy, relatively unambitious, low-alignment trade deal is arguably the most plausible landing zone. The risk of tariffs, not just regulatory barriers, is real.

EU trade chief foresees 'financial services for fishing' Brexit bargain,0.25,Positive,"The EU's trade commissioner has suggested there could be a last-minute trade-off with Brussels offering the City of London access to European markets in return for European fleets retaining their fishing rights in British waters. The UK's financial services sector will lose its automatic right to serve Europe-based clients at the end of the transition period and the EU will need to negotiate access to UK waters for its fishing boats. Phil Hogan, the former Irish minister who is now trade commissioner in Brussels overseeing the next stage of the Brexit negotiations, told the Irish Independent: 'There certainly will be trade-offs, particularly at the end of the negotiations. The EU will be seeking concessions on fishery access and the UK will very probably be seeking concessions on financial services.'Hogan, a longstanding critic of prominent Brexiters including Boris Johnson, described claims that the EU would be put under pressure to seal a deal by parallel UK-US negotiations as 'fairytale economics'ù. Negotiations on the future relationship between the EU and the UK after 31 January, the scheduled date for Brexit, are expected to start in early March once both sides have settled positions on the main issues. EU diplomats were presented with the main principles of the free trade agreement on Monday in which 'access to waters and quota share for fisheries'would be made 'within the context of the economic partnership'ù. Speaking in Luxembourg on Monday, Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, reiterated that the British government would also need to sign up to a series of commitments on state aid, environmental and labour standards to allow tariff- and quota-free trade. She said: 'Great Britain is our friend, the Brits are our friends, it is a friendship that has been growing for a long time but we have to break new ground with each other, and here it applies as well: it is the decision of Great Britain how close or distant of the biggest single market in the world they want to be. 'The closer they are, meaning a level playing field, the more they are ready to respect the European rules, the easier accession to the European single market will be. The further away, the less there is of a level playing field, the more difficult their access to the European single market will be. It is a decision Great Britain has to make and in the negotiations we will have to sound out the scope that we want to use to then determine the negotiations accordingly.'Last week, Andrej Plenkoviƒá, Croatia's prime minister, whose country is taking over the presidency of the EU, conceded that Brussels would be unashamedly 'political'and could threaten to block the City of London's access to European markets if Johnson tries to exempt the UK from its laws. He also warned of the risk of skirmishes at sea similar to those during the 1970s cod wars if a deal on fishing rights was not secured. Asked whether the EU would use its power to switch off the City's ability to serve European clients, to gain leverage in the coming negotiations with Britain, Plenkoviƒá said: 'I wouldn't go into the vocabulary of weapons but what I have learned in international and European negotiations [is] that all arguments and considerations are treated as political.'",0,Neutral
Look to Preston for an answer to Labour's - and Britain's - woes,-0.875,Negative,"Since Labour's resounding election defeat in December, it has become something of a truism to say the loss of its 'heartlands'was many years in the making. Across the north and Midlands, the slow burn of mine closures and deindustrialisation left a decisive void in the party - not only in an economic sense, but also politically. As industry vanished so did the local unions, working men's clubs and labour societies that once offered working people genuine opportunities for democratic participation. Brexit filled this space, offering people a version of the sense of identity, inclusion and control that Labour has since failed to create: some argue that the party's attempt to replay and therefore counteract the referendum may have lost it the 'working-class'vote for good. Yet this breezy homogenisation of the north and Midlands fails to take in the complex geography of Labour's defeat. Why the party continues to thrive in some seats in the midst of heavy defeats elsewhere has barely been covered - a detail surely more important to Labour's recovery than the endless self-flagellation encouraged by many politicians and commentators. Take Preston, a leave-voting bloc of the party's now destroyed 'red wall'ù, and a crumbled bastion of the 'left behind'north - only this wilfully simplistic story does not hold. Under the guidance of the radical Labour councillor Matthew Brown, Preston has democratised its public institutions and invited people to participate in decision-making at all levels of the city's economy. And guess what? Labour held the seat by a healthy margin. Although Labour's share in Preston dropped a little from 2017, it retained much of the vote recovered under Jeremy Corbyn and was still higher than at any other point during the 21st century, while other Labour strongholds in Lancashire such as Heywood and Middleton turned blue for the first time - the culmination of a decline that began in 2005. In so many ways, Preston is indicative of the seats lost by Labour this election. After Margaret Thatcher came to power, the city could only watch as deindustrialisation tore through its democratic fabric. Consolidated under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown's cosmopolitan, big city brand of Labourism, the party's growing obsolescence soon became apparent: between 2001-11, Preston saw a stark decline in Labour's share of the vote. Then, in 2011 - abandoned to austerity by the coalition government - Preston council decided to undertake a radical experiment, now known affectionately as the 'Preston model'ù. The concept, based on the idea of community wealth building, has sought to create a collective and inclusive economy kept in the hands of the city's inhabitants. Through worker co-ops, public enterprise, community land trusts and public planning initiatives, Preston council has not only jumpstarted the city's economy, but turned a place emblematic of the ravages of neoliberalism into what one study calls 'the most improved city in the UK'ù. These positive economic results translated into a boost at the ballot box for Labour at the 2015 election, and by 2017 the party had returned its share of the vote to the highest point since 1997. This should give pause for thought. Perhaps it wasn't simply the nationalist tenor of Brexit that galvanised such ardent commitment from leave voters, but the sense of participation instilled by the vote itself. Labour can blame its loss on nationalist sentiment, rising populism and a hostile press - all of which have no doubt played an increasing role in British politics over the past four years. Or the party can focus on what Brexit continues to reveal: a gulf in political participation waiting to be filled. While Brexit fills this gap in only the most superficial ways, Preston shows how communities can have genuine political agency. Extending autonomy to local institutions, devolving decision-making to the grassroots, cultivating engagement in civic life at the local level - what would this look like on a national scale? This is the question that Labour must answer over the next five years. Crucially, Labour does not need to be in national government to make this happen in towns across the country - it just requires bold local councillors who are willing to venture into new territory. Not only does Labour still run many local administrations, but further cuts under Boris Johnson may actually offer an incentive for councils to move to the direct and radical forms of localism that Preston has pioneered. If continued austerity makes radical local government an attractive option, then the climate crisis makes it an urgent necessity. To stand a chance of mitigating disaster, a green industrial revolution can't wait for a Labour government in five or 10 years; it must begin now in local communities. This would involve, for instance, the development of communally controlled renewable energy, which would allow people around the country to fully partake in the green movement as opposed to being bystanders. It will be no mean feat to revitalise a culture of participation in the places which have been left to build their futures from the scrapheap of 20th-century capitalism. But this is what Labour must do - or face decades in the wilderness as the right continues to capitalise on the alienation and despair that led so many to vote to leave the EU. While constituencies all around them were being lost, Preston remained red in December because, as one Labour councillor said, the city is genuinely taking back control. Preston shows that where Labour cultivates participatory democracy it can still win - it must now do this on a far larger scale.

The Guardian view on the Brexit talks: time to get real,0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson's fascination with the life and times of Winston Churchill is well known. So it was clever of the European commission's new president, Ursula von der Leyen, to recall on Wedneday how, in 1946, the prime minister's hero once made the case for a 'United States of Europe'ù. Churchill's famous intervention helped build the momentum that led to the formation of the European economic community. Ms Von der Leyen, in a speech which preceded a Downing Street meeting with Mr Johnson, said that his postwar call for a new European family remained the best case made for the union. But she acknowledged that, three and a half years after the prime minister successfully campaigned for Vote Leave, the divorce deal between Britain and the EU was 'done and dusted'and it was time 'for the best and oldest friends to build a new future together'ù. A confirmed anglophile, Ms Von der Leyen's charm offensive came ahead of crucial talks on what shape that future would take. The warmth of her words was disarming and effective. But Churchill's position on the United Kingdom and Europe was perhaps a little more complicated than her speech implied. Britain, he wrote in one essay, 'is with Europe, but not of it'ù. It is 'linked, but not comprised'ù. Working out what that might mean, in the context of Brexit and the 21st-century global economy, is a fair summation of the task ahead for Mr Johnson. In charge of a parliamentary majority that gives him licence, Britain's future prosperity depends on the conclusions that he reaches. The country must hope that in the months ahead, behind the inevitable prime ministerial bluster and can-do bonhomie, a sense of sober realism will kick in. At this stage, there is scant evidence of that. By writing into law that Britain must exit the agreed transition period by December, Mr Johnson has needlessly imposed a timetable that limits the scope of what can be achieved in the coming negotiations. His claim that a new cliff edge will give Britain leverage in Brussels and EU capitals is specious. It is far more likely that humble pie will again be consumed in Downing Street, as it was last autumn when the prime minister caved at the 11th hour on the principle of a customs border in the Irish sea, in order to 'get Brexit done'ù. For businesses desperate to retain close and fluid relationships with Britain's biggest and closest trading partner, that could be no bad thing. Ms Von der Leyen made it clear again on Wednesday that the UK's freedom to economically diverge from the EU will come at a high price in tariffs, quotas and customs barriers. There will be no squaring this circle. If he is wise, Mr Johnson will acknowledge this and calibrate demands accordingly. If he agrees to close regulatory alignment in vital sectors such as cars, aerospace, chemicals, food and drink, and pharmaceuticals, a basic free trade deal may be possible by December. But the status of Britain's service economy, which generates the bulk of the country's wealth, is unlikely to be resolved by then. The same goes for the politically fraught areas of agriculture and fishing, and the implications of the government's stated intention to end the free movement of EU citizens into Britain. The alternative to a bare-bones deal would be to crash out, hobbling the economic prospects of a supposedly free and 'global'Britain. But Mr Johnson's majority means he has sufficient room for manoeuvre to ignore the siren calls from his party's Brexit theologians. To follow their advice would be a very high price indeed to pay for 'taking back control'ù. ",0.75,Positive
The Guardian view on Trump's war: UK goes from poodle to lapdog?,0,Neutral,"A British prime minister flies back from a Caribbean holiday where he has been, courtesy of millionaire friends, sunning himself on yachts while the Middle East is in flames and Britain in the grip of a security crisis. Britain's key ally is accused of war crimes on foreign soil in a fight with Iran and its regional proxies. European opinion has quickly solidified around the idea that both sides show restraint. The British response is to defy this advice and endorse a belligerent US administration's approach. Deja vu? It certainly should sound familiar. The year was 2006 and the British prime minister was Tony Blair. His stubborn refusal to call for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon dealt, by his own account, a 'fatal blow'to his premiership. Boris Johnson could console himself that history does not quite repeat itself. He ought not to. Today's crisis in the Middle East is much more dangerous and volatile than the one faced by his predecessor. Unlike Mr Blair, the current Downing Street incumbent is unproven in war. Mr Johnson is also dealing with a far more unstable, narcissistic and bullying president in the shape of Donald Trump than Mr Blair did. The fact Mr Trump did not think it necessary to inform Britain of his rash decision to assassinate Qassem Suleimani - Iran's second most important leader after Ayatollah Khamenei - ought to tell Mr Johnson how little the White House thinks of him. Because the prime minister refused to return home early, his foreign secretary ate his own words in public. Dominic Raab was given a dressing down by his US counterpart after first siding with Europe over the almost certainly illegal killing of the thuggish Suleimani. It was disappointing to see Mr Raab replace his temperate response with self-serving US propaganda. There appears barely any credible evidence of an imminent threat to the US from Suleimani or his Iranian-backed militias. Mr Trump has succeeded in replacing the media focus on his impeachment with the fallout from his lethal strike. This will not be inconsiderable: the Iraqi parliamentary vote for a motion calling for the ejection of US troops from the country is a taste of things to come. Mr Trump lacks the imagination to see the issues involved in the Middle East. The killing of the Iranian general is just another example of the failure of his 'maximum pressure campaign'on Iran. His idea that crippling economic sanctions would force Tehran to capitulate only saw its leadership make bold military moves against both Arab rivals and western interests while restarting key parts of its nuclear programme. Mr Trump projects the image of a strongman. Yet his actions have weakened the US strategic position in the Middle East. The national interest is not a guide to Mr Trump's action. What matters is personal political advantage in a US election year. To stoke his evangelical base he presents his rivalry with Iran as a clash of civilisations. It is appalling that he thinks a legitimate military response is to commit war crimes by levelling Iran's historic monuments. Mr Trump fears a public who already hold his policies responsible for tensions with Tehran. Whatever the Iranian retaliation it will be a messy outcome with no easy way for Mr Trump to pin the blame for war on anyone but himself. Mr Johnson faces the first test of Britain's post-Brexit foreign policy posture. Unlike George W Bush, Mr Trump won't offer the British prime minister a way to sit out any upcoming war. He does not give help for free. He expects a quid pro quo. Jumping into the trenches with the US over a war Britain does not want may be the price Mr Johnson has to pay for a post-Brexit US-UK trade deal. There is a certain truth about the danger of any British prime minister swinging away from conventional wisdom and from British public opinion. Mr Blair was derided because it was said he let Britain become America's poodle. This time the country risks ending up as its lapdog. ",0.875,Positive
"We've built a world that feels cold, yet our desire to connect is very much alive",0,Neutral,"It was decades ago now, but it's still one of the most oddly memorable conversations of my life.On a long, slow train rattling north, with nothing to do but watch the rain, the guy sitting opposite began persistently trying to talk to me. Like most young women who have learned the hard way to be wary of strangers pestering for attention, I was standoffish. But curiosity took over when he said, bluntly, that he wasn't remotely interested in picking anyone up; he was just bored, and liked talking. So that's what we did, for hours and hours, since he turned out to be very good at it. When the train eventually pulled in, we didn't swap numbers - it was a conversation strictly of its time - but I still think about it occasionally on long, boring journeys, before getting a phone out and scrolling silently like everyone else. It's a rare person who can cheerfully bust the social taboo about talking to strangers without any trace of entitlement or sinister intent, but life would be more interesting if more of us knew how to do it. And that's why I can't be as cynical as I probably should be about a campaign launched this week to heal bitter national divides by encouraging Britons to talk to each other. The call for a 'decade of reconnection'after years of polarisation got a predictable pasting on social media, where some saw a veiled demand for remainers to surrender and stop fighting Brexit. But that's missing the broader point of a campaign backed by the likes of Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis, who successfully brings together thousands of strangers in a muddy field every year, and an assortment of religious, cultural and political names as well as the heads of the leave and remain campaigns. All anyone is being asked to do is to start a conversation they wouldn't otherwise have had - maybe with a friend from whom they've drifted apart or a neighbour they don't know - on the grounds that even tiny social overtures can have a surprisingly big impact on how we feel. Obviously, it takes more than a bit of small talk over garden fences to unite a nation fragmented now by so much more than politics. More people live alone than did so a generation ago, and the rise in freelancing means more of us work alone too. We socialise increasingly through screens, firing off texts instead of bothering to call, while social media platforms designed to bring people together have unwittingly given loudhailers to those who would divide us. Worldwide, populations have shifted from small communities where people know each other into anonymous big cities. Without ever meaning to do so, humans have built a world that can feel cold, lonely and fragmented. But behind this depressingly familiar story of atomisation lies growing evidence that our desire to connect isn't dead after all. Millennials may be endlessly accused of burying their heads in their phones, but they are also driving a surge in collective experiences, from festival-going (up 23% in the year to 2018, according to UK Music) to the surprise return of political rallies under Jeremy Corbyn. Even pubs are bouncing back, with numbers rising for the first time in a decade. Podcasts are no longer just a solitary pleasure, enjoyed with headphones firmly plugged in, but sociable live events recorded in front of a crowd. Freelancers sick of typing alone in their kitchens all day have spawned a vast hidden network of Facebook communities for trading gossip, encouragement and help in chasing invoices, sometimes spilling over into real life meet-ups. A campaign arguing that people are happier when they do things with and for each other may well be pushing at a surprisingly open door. True, the 'tube chat'campaign of a few years back flopped in its attempts to make Londoners talk to each other on public transport. But even city dwellers who would normally die rather than make eye contact with strangers still happily consent to being kettled in vast numbers by the Thames for the New Year's Eve fireworks. They would get a far better view at home on the telly - it's not really about the fireworks, but being part of something communal. Meanwhile, there's a whole other country out there in which it is positively rude not to chat to bus drivers or to wish a happy 2020 to anyone you pass on a New Year's Day walk to the pub. When we first moved to the sticks I found all that mildly unnerving, but with time it has become comforting; the same can be true in otherwise struggling small towns where a sense of community lingers. And if all this sounds fluffy, the reason the Blair and Cameron governments wrestled in different ways with the idea of increasing so-called social capital is that fostering goodwill and mutual trust within communities has surprising benefits in the real economy. The behavioural economist David Halpern, who advised both prime ministers on promoting pro-social behaviour, used to argue that high social trust is a more powerful predictor of national prosperity even than skill levels. Low trust, however, is destructive. What's the point of paying your share, reducing your carbon footprint or generally being a good citizen if you don't believe others are doing the same? Where everyone has struggled, of course, is in turning appealing theories of social capital into practical policies that actually work - and there's no guarantee that this latest attempt to reconnect will succeed where others have abruptly fizzled out. But if there's ever a moment to suspend cynical disbelief, it's after a burnt-out decade that millions of us would rather not repeat. Wherever my temporary train friend is now, I hope he's still talking. '¢ Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist ",0.5,Positive
Keir Starmer calls to rebuild party as 'force for good',0,Neutral,"Sir Keir Starmer, the favourite to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader, has called for the party to become a 'trusted force for good'as up to nine rival candidates consider whether to stand next week. The shadow Brexit secretary is seen as the candidate to beat following a YouGov poll showing he has a commanding lead over nearest rival and Corbyn ally Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary. Commissioned by the Economic and Social Research Council's party members project, the poll asked Labour members to list likely contenders on order of preference, with 31% opting for Starmer, 20% for Long-Bailey, and 11% listing Birmingham Yardley MP Jess Phillips as their first choice. In his first comments since the release of the poll, Starmer refused to officially confirm that he would stand, instead telling Sky News: 'The most important thing is that the Labour party is rebuilt, we learn the lessons of the last general election, reflect on them, and address them. But we need the Labour party as a trusted force for good.'The poll's findings, which did not include either affiliated or registered supporters, have prompted some concern among MPs and members who believe Starmer, the member for Holborn and St Pancras, is the wrong candidate to win over seats in the Midlands and the North that were lost to the Tories in the general election. Neil Coyle, MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark and a supporter of Phillips, said 'another white bloke from Islington'was not going to win back Labour's lost heartlands. Long-Bailey, the MP for Salford and Eccles, has been seen as the candidate to continue Corbyn's transformation of the party. Ian Lavery, Labour's chairman, said that he is still considering his options despite speculation that he may drop out to ensure that Long-Bailey has a smooth path. A spokesman said Lavery has been 'inundated with requests from Labour members and supporters asking him to stand'ù. Lisa Nandy, the MP for Wigan is expected to make a decision this weekend after being urged to stand by union and party members. The only candidates to declare so far are the shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and the shadow treasury minister Clive Lewis. Yvette Cooper, the former welfare secretary who has long been touted as a possible leadership candidate, is expected to rule herself out of the contest. A friend told the Guardian: 'The party membership is currently looking for someone who has been in Jeremy's shadow cabinet not someone who has been in the actual cabinet under Gordon Brown.'Others considering whether to stand include David Lammy, the Labour member for Tottenham, and Dan Jarvis, the Sheffield City mayor. The contest has to take at least five weeks, according to party rules, but the actual timetable will be decided by a meeting of the party's national executive committee on 6 January. Some on the left of the party have grown increasingly concerned that Starmer could be buoyed by a 'centrist insurgence'of registered supporters - members who pay a one-off fee to vote in the leadership contest. A party source said that members of the party's ruling body which is dominated by Corbyn supporters are being asked to open registration for a limited period. 'There is real concern that there could be an influx of people who don't share the party's values,'the source said. Under Labour's preferential voting system other candidates would be successively knocked out. The YouGov poll does not include affiliates such as trade unions and registered supporters, who have also been able to vote in previous elections. Exact rules for this contest are still being finalised. ",0.25,Positive
Let's be friends: Boris Johnson's new year message to remainers,0.5,Positive,"Boris Johnson has pledged to represent remainers and work with them as 'friends and equals'ù, in a New Year's Day message in which he sounded upbeat about the UK's fortunes in the 2020s.  The prime minister, who is seeing in the new year on the private Caribbean island of Mustique, said he was 'acutely aware'that millions of people did not vote for him despite the Tories' landslide election victory. In a statement full of familiar election slogans that he was 'getting Brexit done'and the deal with the EU was 'oven ready'ù, Johnson also thanked those who do not see themselves as natural Conservatives for backing him at the polls on 12 December.  He said: 'I know that many of you do not consider yourself natural Tories and may only have lent me your vote. I am humbled by your support and will work every day to keep it. I am also acutely aware that there are millions of people who did not vote for me and were disappointed by the result. 'If you are one of them, I want to reassure you that I will be a prime minister for everyone, not just those who voted for me. I know that you love this country no less, simply because you voted for another party or wanted to remain.'As part of his overtures to remain supporters he said he wished to work with them as 'friends and equals'ù. He has spoken since his election victory of running a 'people's government'ù. Johnson has so far surrounded himself with Vote Leave figures, including his top team of political and media advisers. His chief adviser and strategist, Dominic Cummings, director of communications, Lee Cain, and press secretary, Robert Oxley, all ran the successful campaign group to exit the EU in 2016. The prime minister's drift towards a hard Brexit was regularly criticised during the election campaign by Labour, especially over his insistence not to extend the transition period beyond 2020, which could lead to a no-deal scenario, and for not properly protecting environmental and workers' rights. Overcoming division in the country and moving forward was another theme of Johnson's message, which was filmed to be shared on social media. 'That distinctive sound you may have heard at midnight as the bongs of Big Ben faded away was not the popping of champagne corks or the crackle of fireworks from your neighbour's garden. 'Rather it was the starting gun being fired on what promises to be a fantastic year and a remarkable decade for our United Kingdom,'he said. His 'oven-ready'Brexit catchphrase was also redeployed. 'That oven-ready deal I talked about so much during the election campaign has already had its plastic covering pierced and been placed in the microwave,'he said. Beyond leaving the EU, he said one of the first bills to be passed through the Commons in 2020 would be legislation on NHS funding, that enshrines in law the injection of an extra £34bn a year. Other domestic priorities include raising education standards and getting Britain back up the international school league tables.  ",0,Neutral

'I was jolted by the realisation that this young, lone, insignificant little person got fed up with the establishment and gave the world a shove - - and the world moved,'wrote Bob Braddock from Chattanooga Tennessee.

"Brexit discourse contributed to death of Jo Cox, says bishop",0,Neutral,"The Church of England's first black female bishop has said the debate around Brexit damaged society and contributed to the death of the MP Jo Cox. Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the former chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons, said the arguments around Brexit had had a harmful effect both on parliamentarians and on society as a whole. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World at One on Tuesday, she said: 'The discourse that we've had over the last three years [has] been pretty damaging. Damaging not only to parliamentarians [but also to] the wider community and society as a whole. It's been very, very damaging and of course I have always believed that the kind of discourse that we had contributed to the death of Jo Cox. 'I really believed that then and I still believe it today. So yes, we needed to change the discourse.'When the host, Sarah Montague, asked: 'Do you mean the way that politicians spoke to each other contributed to the death of Jo Cox?'ù, Hudson-Wilkin said: 'The way that we related to one another over this wretched topic contributed. If you think about what the person was shouting when he inflicted harm on our dear sister Jo, you will know that the language that we were using with each other contributed to that.'She continued: 'Parliamentarians may not be shouting Britain First with a gun in hand or another kind of weapon, but we have to be careful about the way we use language. We might go and have a drink with each other afterwards or a cup of tea or whatever, somebody out there who is not all together there may do something else.'Hudson-Wilkin took up her post as bishop of Dover last month.

The populist right fought a dirty culture war. Labour failed to fight back,0,Neutral,"In the post-election rows about Labour's heavy losses, Brexit is ever-present. The party lost 2 million of its 2017 voters to parties that had chosen one side of the European divide more explicitly. Hundreds of thousands of other Labour voters likely stayed at home. But less examined is the impact that Brexit had on this election simply by being a part of our political culture for so many years. Without downplaying the failures of the Labour party campaign or its leadership, it's important to remember that the four-year Brexit saga has helped to create the political and social atmosphere in which a populist rightwing party was primed to win. People voted to leave the EU for many different reasons, but the Brexit expected next year is an oligarch-financed populist-right project. However hard some tried to find socialist alibis after the referendum took place (and took Labour voters with it), the impetus for it came from the nationalist right, stoking fears over immigration and yoking these to anti-establishment resentments. High-profile leavers could have focused, post-referendum, on a blueprint for EU departure, but energies went into constructing a majoritarian narrative around the 'will of the people'ù. The 48% who voted remain were cast as the Brexit-sabotaging elite, alongside immigrants, 'citizens of nowhere'ù, city-dwellers, Brussels bureaucrats, parliament, the judiciary, liberals, 'woke'leftists and the media. This narrative was mainlined into social media-boosted rolling news cycles. In scores of exchanges in TV and radio studios, I felt the futility of trying to hold back the tide of illiberal assaults from Brexit campaigners and their newspaper cheerleaders. They would fire off a scattergun of populist right slogans - putting progressives in a quandary over which was worse: chewing up broadcast time in rebuttals, or leaving false and incendiary claims unchallenged. (Of course, some leave advocates made the case without deploying such language - but as a TV producer once told me, they were in short supply.) The nativist right relishes a good 'betrayal'narrative - which is why Johnson and his Brexit brigade were so keen to label the law blocking no deal, enacted in September, as a 'surrender act'ù. It's why shutting down parliament - and playing with the notion that the judges who forced it to re-open were biased - was necessary, creating the optics of antagonism between the system and 'the people'ù. Amid disruption, chaos and confusion there is often a yearning for an authoritarian leader who can promise to get things done. Last year some even made this point precisely: at least strongmen actually deliver. This is what Labour was coming up against. It is not to airbrush failures of leadership to suggest the Brexit-ification of political life helped to shape the fury and disappointment so many Labour canvassers encountered nationwide during the election campaign. The Brexit discourse amped up the right's sense of wounded national pride, which found its perfect antithesis in a Labour leader so often accused of not being patriotic. And while these critiques of Corbyn were in ready supply, it is worth recalling that Boris Johnson was not characterised as anti-British, even while he attacked national institutions such as parliament, threatened public service broadcasting, or misled the Queen. The toxic atmosphere of this general election was also evidenced by the sheer variety of falsehoods coming from the Conservatives. One BBC News article gave the impression that all political parties were peddling mistruths during the election campaign from its headline. But the article actually revealed that 88% of the Conservative party's most widely promoted social media ads contained misleading information, according to a First Draft study. The amount of equivalent falsehoods in Labour ads? 0%. One Conservative campaign leaflet sent to Labour battlefields stated that immigration was putting pressure on the NHS, which Corbyn's plans to 'extend freedom of movement'would exacerbate. Following the Conservative election win, there has been a spate of race-hate attacks and far-right demagogues have lined up to join the party. How can the left counter a dirty tricks culture war with the populist right? Labour wanted to shift the conversation on to economic ground, creating a different 'us'versus 'them'by pitting the billionaire few, who benefit from the current financial system, against the many who don't. But the trouble is that this focus on class inequalities could not find sufficient purchase in a political conversation already saturated with rightwing antagonisms. As Labour found out to its cost, if the left does not challenge and dismantle such nativist forces, it risks getting bulldozed by them instead.

"To Johnson, the Brexit spoils. And the amnesia",0,Neutral,"Back of the net,'shouted an unidentified Tory MP as the majority of 124 for the second reading of the Brexit withdrawal agreement was declared. That got a few cheers, but not many. After all, it had been the most open of open goals. It had all been too easy. A bit like watching Liverpool take on a team of under-11s. And even then, some of the under-11s had started playing for the other side, as 30 Labour MPs either voted with the government or abstained. If anything, there was a slight feeling of anticlimax in the chamber as MPs departed for their Christmas break. Not to mention a sense of deja vu. Boris Johnson had opened the debate by saying that now was the time to end the dither and delay. Rather forgetting, yet again, that few politicians had done more to prevent Brexit happening over the past three and a half years than him. He had twice voted against Theresa May's own Brexit deal, which had been - on his own previous admissions - substantially better than his own, in order to further his own career. But that was part of a prehistory now consigned to oblivion. 12 December had marked a new Year Zero in British politics. One in which the world must be rewritten in the image of its new Supreme Leader. The Once and Future World King. Anyone who dared to mention either that Johnson had described his Brexit deal as one to which no UK prime minister could possibly agree, or that it had actually already passed its second reading once before, was at risk of being disappeared. The truth was sinking fast and before long there would not even be a ripple on the surface to show it had even existed. 'It is time to come together and get Brexit done,'he said. It was time for the nation to be reinvigorated and to forget the old divisions of leave and remain. The downside to all this was that they were to be replaced with the new divisions of losers and winners. And it was about time the losers just sucked it up. Boris may talk the talk on healing, but every smirk, every casual aside, betrays his baser, primal instincts. His first reaction is always to gloat. He is a man entirely without humility. Anyone who challenges his sense of entitlement is to be crushed. Yes, there were one or two changes to his previous withdrawal agreement bill that definitely hadn't been passed in October, he conceded. The bit about safe passage for children of refugees had needed to be canned. Not because he had anything against children, mind. Rather because it was always useful to keep them as bargaining chips. It's what the kiddies would have wanted. Same with workers', food and environmental rights. Far too important to be left aligned with the EU when there was a chance of watering them down for a US trade deal. And as for the guaranteed end to transition that made a no-deal Brexit a real possibility at the end of next year, everyone deserved the chance to be poorer. We were in a new space-time continuum. Up was down and down was up. And there wasn't a damn thing anyone in the Commons could say to change that. Not that many were minded to do so. They were too busy drinking the Kool Aid. It was a debate characterised mostly by absence. An absence of thought and an absence of personnel. All the true one nation Tory MPs who used to expose the flaws in Boris's Brexit have been erased from the Commons. As Johnson now goes unchallenged, so he appears at best only half interested in his own arguments, having long since taken for granted that he would win. He looked like a man who was phoning it in and could scarcely be bothered to even acknowledge the concerns of the Scottish National party and Northern Irish MPs. It now feels like almost an inevitability that the union will break up at some point in the next 10 years. Jeremy Corbyn was also operating on low power mode. He has been ever since the election, but this time he had an excuse. Because there was literally nothing he could say to make a difference. There were faintly despairing speeches from Labour's Hilary Benn, Matthew Pennycook and Keir Starmer but the Tory benches were almost a total IQ-free zone. As Owen Paterson, Mark Francois and Liam Fox were only too happy to prove, since they are too stupid to remember that this was a Brexit deal to which they too had been vehemently opposed for more than three years. But to the victors, the spoils. And the amnesia. Boris stood triumphant, surrounded by sycophants and crowned in laurels. He was Caesar. The autocrat, disguised as a man of the people, whose prescription for blue-collar Conservatism was old-fashioned, establishment paternalism. Brexit was done. Even if it wasn't. And anyone who dared whisper the word Brexit again after 31 January would be arrested for thought crimes. Boris had hoped he would feel more elated than this, but instead he could only feel disappointment closing in. He had gained the world, but had long since lost both his family and his soul. His narcissism would inevitably destroy him. In the beginning is my end. Now the light falls.

They came from south Asia to help rebuild Britain. The racism they saw then is back,0.5,Positive,"I don't know what it is to be British any more.'This from a man who is a professor at a prominent university and part of the British establishment. So how did it come to this? For the past five years I have been interviewing the generation that came from the Indian subcontinent to postwar Britain. These early pioneers arrived with as little as £3 due to strict currency controls. They are now elderly people. I have watched as they have grown older, frailer, their voices weaker. Some have died. Their stories are an overlooked part of British history. It's important to record them before it's too late. From 1948 until the early 1960s, these former subjects of the British Raj automatically became British citizens. They came here for a better life, and to rebuild the country after the second world war. Many worked the difficult shifts that no one else wanted - in the mills, factories, foundries and new public services. Many bore children here. Roots were laid ever deeper with each generation. My BBC Radio 4 series Three Pounds in My Pocket has charted the social history of British south Asians from the 1950s onwards. The current series looks at the 1980s. The decade saw a new kind of Britishness expressed by the second generation, alongside concerns over integration. And dramatic events - such as the publication of The Satanic Verses and the Indian army's storming of the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the holiest shrine for Sikhs - saw the British south Asian community start to fragment, largely along religious lines. In the final programme I unpack the 'Asian'part of British south Asian, and explain why it's often difficult to give a succinct answer to that loaded question: Where are you from? You may have moved from one country to another during the partition of British India. You may identify with a region more than a country - say Punjab, Sylhet, Mirpur or Gujarat. Or the country you were born in may have become a new country twice over. But what I was not expecting was for some interviewees to find the 'British'part of British south Asian harder to define in the current political environment. Runi Sayeed came to Britain in 1968 from Dhaka in what would become Bangladesh. She was a teacher. Recently, she'd got off the bus with her husband, and was walking down the street when a passer-by shouted at her: 'Why don't you go back to your country? Why are you here?' Sayeed's daughter Farah was furious. 'She's lived 50 years of her life here and only 24 of them in Bangladesh. So being made to feel acutely foreign again feels unacceptable. But it seems to be what's happening.'When Farah says 'again'ù, she means the outward racism she and her mother experienced almost daily in the 1970s and early 1980s. Farah feels the racist attitudes she thought had subsided, or at least were no longer voiced, are resurfacing in the public realm. And it started for them after the Brexit vote. Research suggests there was a rise in racially motivated hate crimes after the 2016 referendum. While exact demographic breakdowns aren't available, a significant minority of British south Asians voted for Brexit. But almost everyone I spoke to for the series felt it represented a turning of the tide. Amandeep Madra, who works for a global pharmaceutical company, says it's not just post-Brexit. Donald Trump telling congresswomen to 'go home'resonated strongly with him. It 'was what you saw daubed on a wall or what you heard being screamed at you'ù, he says. And you can joke that home is Southall or Northolt, 'but it still cuts really deep'ù. The professor who told me he no longer knew what it was to be British is Gurhurpal Singh. He is a gentle, thoughtful man. He dislikes talking about the personal and prefers to speak as an academic, referencing data and evidence. So I was taken aback by his candour. He has spent nearly all his life in Britain. He came with his parents as a young boy from the Indian Punjab in 1964. He grew up in Leicester when to have a different skin colour invited trouble. He suffered physical attacks and saw the National Front marching in the street. Yet he says since the referendum he feels more rootless than ever. Over his lifetime there was progress. Laws criminalising racism were enacted, minority political representation increased and cultural expression grew. He thought things could only improve, that it was a one-way road. He now feels that was just a theory 'sold by liberals to migrants who came here '¶ And it's been proven that radical reversals occur.' Five years ago when I embarked upon recording testimonies of those who came to Britain so many decades back, I did not expect to hear them talk like this. The things Singh said saddened me. He has spent nearly all his life in this country - making significant contributions - and he says he now no longer knows how to relate to contemporary Britain. The political climate has changed towards minorities - it's not only Brexit, or Trump's rhetoric. Racism became a central election issue. The two main political parties stand accused of antisemitism and Islamophobia. The Windrush scandal showed that, however long the first generation are here, you could still be sent back. People from ethnic minorities feel this all acutely, even if they have been here for decades. They are all the 'other'ù. They have heard these racial slurs before, recognise this hostility. They just didn't think they would have to live through it all again. '¢ Kavita Puri is the presenter of the Radio 4 series Three Pounds in My Pocket.

Labour must not just accept Brexit but embrace it,0,Neutral,"Modern Britain has been shaped by two events: the banking crisis of 2008 and the Brexit vote eight years later. The reason Boris Johnson is sitting in No 10 is that the Conservatives have learned the right lessons from these episodes and Labour has not. The Tories have understood that their response to the financial meltdown - a prolonged period of austerity that squeezed living standards - was unpopular and wrong. They also twigged that Brexit was a revolt against austerity and free-market economics more generally - so they have embraced the decision to leave the European Union and positioned themselves as the party of intervention and the working classes. Labour got the first part of this narrative but not the second. In this general election it sought to divorce austerity from Brexit - with disastrous results. Labour won seats in 2017 when it said it would respect the referendum result, but saw its 'red wall'breached when it moved steadily closer to remain. Having chosen not to listen to what voters in its former heartlands were saying, Labour now seems bemused to find that they have migrated to a party that did. Labour's Brexit stance was not the only reason it lost the election. The number of seats won by the party has fallen, with one exception, at every election since 1997. Corbyn bucked the trend in 2017 and although he only managed to emulate Gordon Brown's performance in the defeat of 2010, there was hope that Labour could avoid becoming as politically irrelevant as the social democratic parties in Germany and France. But to do so Labour had to keep its broad electoral coalition together. The problem in doing so became evident as the campaign wore on. Voters in the former industrial parts of the country are not mugs. They could see that Labour's stance on Brexit had moved from respecting the referendum result in 2016, to telling the public to have another think (and to come up with a different result) in 2019. And when canvassing returns showed the likely loss of seats in the red wall, Labour made matters worse by coming up with a string of panicky, and expensive, electoral bribes. To many voters, these seemed an insult to their intelligence, which indeed they were. All of which leaves Labour in a terrible place. It is not just that the Conservatives are in power for at least the next five years. It is not even that seats once thought impregnable have been lost. It is the failure - for a second time in a decade - to be able to exploit conditions that looked tailor-made for a party of the left. The financial crisis marked a watershed for global economic liberalism, because its fundamental tenet - that markets worked best when governments took a back seat - came under scrutiny. Brexit was one of the ways in which the pushback against the orthodoxy manifested itself, but much of the remainer left in the UK has been unable to grasp this. Instead of seeing Brexit as a vote for a different sort of economy, it has demonised leave voters as nativists and racists. It decided early on that no matter what form Brexit took, it would be worse than the status quo. This was a curious argument, because it presupposed that nothing ever changes: that there would be no new policies, no attempts to improve on what currently exists, no attempts to respond to any short-term problems that Brexit might cause. By this token, Labour's national investment bank and its Keynesian infrastructure programme would have made no difference either. Brexit has already been a catalyst for change. It has forced the government to spend rather than cut. The Conservatives are committed to increase both the minimum wage and have pledged to use the money saved by scrapping a planned reduction in corporation tax to spending on the NHS. The need for state intervention in the economy is now accepted: regional policy is back in vogue. So Labour's remainers face a choice. Option one is to move straight from supporting a second referendum to arguing for rejoining the EU. This is an entirely negative strategy and relies on UK voters looking at the dismal growth across the Channel and saying: 'We want what they are having.'It seems a tad unlikely. Option two involves grudgingly accepting that Brexit is a reality and that Labour's approach should be to make the best of a bad job. This would be a continuation of Corbyn's triangulation strategy and have the same baleful result. The message sent to leave voters would be the same as it has been consistently from remainers since 2016: you got it wrong, you idiots. This doesn't seem to be a particularly good way of rebuilding the red wall either. Strategy three is the hardest for remainers to swallow but it is the only option that offers a way back for Labour: embrace Brexit and argue for a left version of Britain outside the EU. This could take many forms: a devolution of power to local mayors; a new deal for the north; state support for green industry that would provide well-paid jobs in every constituency. It means exuding optimism that things can get better rather than telling people who are struggling, but not destitute, that only state handouts can alleviate their misery. The choice is simple: start putting together a post-Brexit progressive project or have a monster sulk and watch the Tories make the political weather.

The Guardian view on the Queen's speech: glitter but no gold,0.125,Positive,"A mere nine weeks have separated the previous Queen's speech from the one that was delivered by the monarch on Thursday from the throne at Westminster. Boris Johnson's government was the author of both, and parliament has barely had time to sit during the gap in between. So it might have been reasonable to assume that the two speeches - each of which sets out a Johnson government's legislative agenda - contained fundamentally the same programme. In fact they were significantly different. The difference is explained by one thing: the result of the general election in between. The October speech was a political stunt launched in defiance of a divided parliament, designed to force the issue of Brexit so that Britain could leave the EU by 31 October. Its object was to cast critics of the government's Brexit strategy as blockers and wreckers. It contained nothing concrete about fundamental subjects such as social care and climate change. It was a disgrace. This week's speech can certainly not be described as gimmick-free. Large parts of it are also constructed around vague generalities which have not yet hardened into legislative plans. But it is far heavier on substance and strategy than its predecessor. This all reflects Mr Johnson's emphatic election victory and his working majority. These have opened up new priorities as well as some of the old ones, and now he has the votes to deliver. Brexit remains the top item of Mr Johnson's business, now as before. It was the first item in the new speech and it was followed, on Thursday afternoon, by the re-presentation of the government's withdrawal agreement bill, which received a formal first reading. It gets its second reading on Friday. This procedural rush sets a very bad precedent. Bills are normally published at least 10 days before second reading, and for good reason. They ought to be studied before they are discussed. The new bill deals with the most major issue facing Britain. Proper parliamentary process should have been followed. There could be no clearer sign of the government's intention to teach parliament a lesson and to clip MPs' wings than this. Everything in the Queen's speech is focused on two complementary messages. First, that the Brexit gridlock of the last parliament is over; and second, that Mr Johnson's domestic priority is the post-Brexit needs of the areas captured from Labour last week. But Brexit is not over. And the detail of the bills foreshadowed this week remains to be held up to the light - not least on immigration, employment and the environment. Nevertheless, the speech's main theme, that prosperity must be redistributed across the country, is right. Its focus on the NHS, infrastructural investment, schools, social care and fighting crime points the way clearly enough. Mr Johnson underscored some of this in his own speech later. But he did so in a boastful and hyperbolic posh-boy address, full of grating claims to head a people's government and silly promises of a new golden age. It was understandable in some ways, but deeply ill-advised in others. Optimism and Jeremy Corbyn have helped Mr Johnson get where he is today. He now also needs to remember that he is not much trusted, even now, by many who voted for him. Confidence must be earned. He must also recognise the challenge from Scotland, underlined by Nicola Sturgeon on Thursday, which cannot just be met with snobbish insults. Mr Johnson needs to deliver. The Queen's speech suggests he aims to do that. But the prime minister's own speech shows he faces an uphill battle, not least against himself, if he is to do it. ",0,Neutral
Labour gifted Boris Johnson his 'òBrexit election'. We can't be so inept again,0.25,Positive,"Listening to Labour colleagues on the media over the last week, I have repeatedly heard the refrain that the problem we faced last Thursday was that 'this became the Brexit election'ù. To which I can only say: I look forward to their tweets of shock when next Wednesday's lunch features turkey and brussels sprouts. Let's be clear: this was always going to be the Brexit election, the first genuine single-issue election in 119 years. Back then, in 1900, the Tories were cynically capitalising on their early success in the Boer war to try to win another thumping majority over the Liberals. It was also Labour's very first election, and we went into it with noble domestic ambitions far distant from the South African veldt. Provision for the aged poor. Better houses. Useful work for the unemployed. Adequate maintenance for children. The nationalisation of railways. And the establishment of social and economic equality between the sexes. Worthy priorities indeed, but we only won two seats, while the Tories stuck to their single issue and claimed a majority of more than 130. At least then, we never had a choice. Calling an election was entirely in the government's gift. But this time, we have no excuse. Boris Johnson proposed an election at a time of his own choosing, on an issue of his own choosing, and we went along with it - like crackers voting for Christmas. The Liberal Democrats agreed to it because they thought it would work in their favour, and Labour because we imagined we could change the subject. That was a total delusion. I wrote to the leader's office warning it would be 'an act of catastrophic political folly'to vote for the election, and explained exactly why we should not go along with it. I argued that the single issue of Brexit should not be enough to give Johnson a five-year mandate to enact his agenda on every issue. Instead, I said we should insist on a referendum on his proposed deal, to get the issue of Brexit out of the way before any general election. When I raised this at the shadow cabinet, and spoke forcefully against an election, some colleagues nodded along, but the loudest voices were pro-leave colleagues insisting that we should vote with Johnson. So we wilfully went into a single-issue election with no clear position on that issue and, as every pollster predicted, we were brutally squeezed by all the other parties with an unequivocal policy on Brexit, all of them sharing a clear strategy to eat into Labour's base. All over the country, we could see ourselves going backwards, despite the incredible hard work of our brilliant volunteers, councillors and candidates. They saw this result coming a mile off, and were amazed that the people running the campaign could not. Worst of all, while we tried to focus on the implications of Brexit for the NHS, the Tories more successfully tied Labour's ambiguity on the issue to their other main argument: that Jeremy Corbyn could not be trusted with the levers of power - a complete contrast with 2017, when his clear principles and authenticity had been major assets. People can argue that our position should have been more pro-leave or more pro-remain, but the reality is we should never have allowed a Brexit election, which was Johnson's obvious strategic goal from the moment he took office. The question now is: how do we fight back from here? The answer is certainly not to have some great ideological debate between left, right and centre. Neither is it to set this up as a battle between leave and remain, north and south, or indeed men and women. When did we stop being for the many, not just half of us? It won't earn raucous cheers at a rally, but our starting point should instead be to ask ourselves: where is the strategic thinking in our party? Who has a proper plan for the future? Say what you like about New Labour after 1994, and it's known that I disagree with much of what it did, but credit where credit's due: that team had deep political insight and absolute clarity of purpose, boiled down to a five-point pledge-card. It would never have voted to give Johnson the Brexit election he craved. When I faced Johnson for the entire two years he was foreign secretary, the only ministerial job he previously held, my strategy was to focus relentlessly on five key issues where there were huge differences between Labour's policy and his, and where his position was indefensible: the Northern Ireland border; the war in Yemen; Donald Trump; human rights; and climate change. I took the fight to him every day, and pummelled him every week. Each time, the mask slipped, and we saw the real man - a mendacious, lazy, dangerous charlatan, unable to hide behind the tiresome smokescreen of bluster he usually relies on. He hated it, especially coming from a woman. So when the Labour leadership contest begins, whoever is standing - and I hope to be one of the candidates - the first question shouldn't be about their position on Brexit, or where they live in our country. The first question should instead be: what's your plan for taking on Johnson over the next five years? And do you have the political nous and strategic vision to reunite our party, rebuild our machine, gain the trust of the public, give hope to our declining towns and smaller cities, and never again waste the opportunity to take back power? Goodness knows, we've been taught a painful enough lesson in how to prosecute a successful political strategy by Johnson over the last five months. And if you're a Labour voter seized with gloom - or a Tory gleaming with complacency - just remember that in 1906, six years after the last single-issue election, the Liberal opposition won a majority of 124, with the Tories losing 246 seats. Why? Because the Tories were totally divided over trade policy and because their 'single issue'of the Boer war had turned into a disaster. Will history repeat itself now as the Tories grapple with the reality of 'getting Brexit done'ù? Well, history has a tendency to do that. And when the next election comes, I'd certainly like Labour to have a leader and team in place with the strategic vision to foresee and exploit Johnson's failings. Because if we can overturn that Tory majority, we can start focusing on the pledges from that 1900 Labour manifesto, which are now more than a century overdue - on elderly people, on housing, on the unemployed, and on child poverty. That's the prize. Let's keep our eye on it. '¢ Emily Thornberry is the Labour MP for Islington South and Finsbury, and the shadow foreign secretary ",0,Neutral
What Johnson has to drop to get a quick trade deal after Brexit,0.25,Positive,"Boris Johnson's decision to outlaw an extension to the Brexit transition period is being widely seen as a purely political gesture. But it is a high-risk approach, which Theresa May's former Brexit adviser Raoul Ruparel has said will lead to a 'narrow and shallow'deal. 'A very narrow and shallow deal would not be very different to no deal and you would likely have to take some political pain to get it,'said Joe Owen, Brexit programme director at the Institute for Government, referring to the concessions Johnson's would probably have to make. The EU has already said a bare-bones trade deal would be conditional on the UK accepting the EU's rules on level playing fields on workers' and consumers' rights, state aid and environment protections, something the Conservatives have so far refused to countenance. The UK may also have to make concessions on EU demands to continue fishing access in British waters. Emmanuel Macron has warned Boris Johnson that the UK must remain 'loyal'to EU standards after Brexit for British companies to maintain access to the European market. 'That could mean using quite a lot of political capital for short-term gain, which would allow Johnson to say he got a deal,'said Owen. The right to export goods to the EU, cars and agriculture in particular, without tariffs of quotas. '¢ Security: agreement to share police and security services intelligence between the EU and the UK. This would include European arrest warrants, which allow police forces to pursue criminals and terrorists across borders. '¢ Services including financial services, the biggest single contributor to the British GDP, and international TV channels which broadcast across the EU. '¢ Intellectual property: this includes protections for copyright and trade marks for businesses that sell into the EU. '¢ Aviation: a deal that would secure the right for airline to fly from the UK to an EU member state is considered doable. However, a deal to allow a British airline to fly from one EU country to another would be far more complex and likely to be pushed into the future. '¢ Science research funding: the UK has been a major beneficiary of programmes such as Horizon2020. Ongoing cooperation would not be part of a trade deal leaving universities and research hospitals unable to apply to part of EU-funded collaborations. '¢ Data: Brexit potentially affects all personal data transfers between the UK and EU member states.

Now Britain's navel-gazing has to end. It's time to keep our aid pledge to the world,-0.25,Negative,"We are standing at a pivotal moment in the UK's relationship with the rest of the world. As parliament reassembles post-election, nations around the world, both within the EU and beyond, are waiting to see what direction the UK will take. The past three years have been dominated by Brexit. By deals forged and then lost. By a string of votes in parliament. By demonstrations and debates and disunity. Whatever side of the fence you fall on, it's hard to disagree that our country has lost its united national purpose. Looking from the outside, many nations - even while accepting the referendum result - have been truly puzzled and dismayed by our handling of it. We cannot afford another three years of navel-gazing. While digesting the impact of the election on pressing national issues, it's time that Britain confounded that puzzlement abroad and reaffirmed its place as an outward-facing, global leader. And there's no better place to do that than within international development. The UK has a long and proud legacy of supporting and investing in the world's most vulnerable communities. From Bolivia to Bangladesh, our investment has saved the lives of millions, and is helping them reshape and rebuild shattered communities. But while we've made huge progress in reducing extreme poverty worldwide, there is still a long way to go. Climate change is taking hold, natural disasters are becoming more deadly and frequent than ever before, new wars are erupting and mass displacement is growing. The world is becoming a more dangerous place, especially for children. They can't wait for Britain to get its act together. I served as minister of state for the Department for International Development (DfID) until earlier this year; I've seen first-hand what a difference aid makes. With the full backing of a parliament that is often bitterly divided on other matters, we helped deliver £30 million to rebuild hospitals, schools and other vital buildings destroyed by Islamic State in Iraq. As a result, families torn apart by the terror group's brutality have been able to start moving back home. Aid is more than just platitudes by governments. It transforms lives. It's because of this proven success that we can't back away from our international commitments. In southern Africa, the worst drought in more than three decades has put a record 45 million people across 16 countries at risk of food shortages. Aid agency World Vision has estimated that put together, this is enough people to stretch around the world one and a half times. Across the globe, the impact of quakes, tsunamis, typhoons, floods and droughts is slowing economic growth, undermining development and trapping millions of people in poverty. Just this year, Mozambique suffered its two most severe cyclones on record within weeks, while devastating floods tore through Asia. These crises need urgent intervention if we are to avoid thousands of needless deaths. I hope the government will not make a hasty decision on merging DfID and the Foreign Office. A standalone DfID has been excellent for the UK's reputation abroad, and those who work for it truly represent global Britain. As we enter this new season, my message to our new political leaders is this: use that unity between parliament and people as an anchor for rebuilding our national purpose, and demonstrate that we will not forget the world's poor. They're counting on us. Alistair Burt is a former minister of state for international development and former Conservative MP.  ",0,Neutral
So Boris Johnson is going to 'òdo' Brexit - but what are the actual options?,-0.625,Negative,"Brexit is 'oven ready'and will be 'done'on 31 January of next year. True enough. Except, of course, virtually nothing will actually change - except that we lose our voice and vote, and what remains of our influence on the future course of the EU. We'll still be in the single market, free movement will continue, as will our financial contributions, and there will be no tariffs or customs checks, either between Dublin and Calais or in the Irish Sea. Instead, we will enter an uneasy interregnum, the so-called 'transition'period - really a standstill period. So what happens next? A trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020, as per the Conservative manifesto promise, a pledge repeated by Michael Gove on Sunday. The manifesto also included a promise that there would be no extension to this period. And, according to No 10 sources quoted in the Sunday Times, the deal would be on terms dictated by the hardline Brexiteers, meaning no 'level playing field'provisions that would stop the UK setting its own course on labour rights, environmental protection and state aid. There's just one problem. There's no chance of the EU agreeing to such a deal. No level playing field - not to mention concessions in other politically sensitive areas, such as fisheries - means no trade deal. So that appears to leave the government with two unattractive options. First, no trade deal at all, with the transition period ending at the end of 2020. This wouldn't be no deal; the withdrawal agreement, including citizens' rights, our continuing financial obligations and the special arrangements for Northern Ireland, would still bind both sides. But it would be the hardest of hard Brexits for British business, with tariffs, customs controls and a cliff-edge exit from the single market. The long-term economic damage, according to both the government's own modelling and independent estimates by UK in a Changing Europe, - in a report that I worked on - would be up to 8% of GDP, or £2,500 per head. On the plus side, we'd get our fish back, although we'd have to eat them ourselves rather than sell them to the rest of Europe as we mostly do now. And, perhaps most damaging of all, there would be a full customs and regulatory border, with tariffs and more, in the Irish Sea. So if this hardly seems appealing, what's the alternative? Once again, we're entering into a negotiation with a much larger and economically more powerful partner, and with the guillotine of a hard (albeit largely self-imposed) deadline. The outcome seems obvious: a deal, but on the EU's terms. Those are best summed up by my former, and ever-pessimistic (or, as he would put it, realistic) colleague Ivan Rogers, the UK's former ambassador to the EU: 'A quick and dirty tariff- and quota-free deal, involving stringent level-playing-field conditions and an agreement on fisheries - their [the EU's] key objectives, not the UK's.'But while economically somewhat less damaging overall, this would have some major drawbacks. For some industries, such as the automotive and chemical industries, not to mention tradeable services, tariffs are the least of their Brexit-induced problems - the impact would still be severe. And perhaps more important than the economic impacts would be the administrative ones. With transition ended and a deal in place, free movement will end, and the prime minister will have no excuse for not implementing a new immigration system. The problem is that hardly anyone thinks such a system can be delivered in a year. Still worse, it seems highly unlikely that the UK will be ready, either economically, administratively or politically, to implement the new arrangements for Northern Ireland. So is Johnson caught between a rock and a hard place? Yes, but remember he's been here before. As recently as October, it seemed his choice was no deal or political suicide. And yet he found a way through. He agreed to the EU's proposals in substance - the borders of the single market will be in the Irish Sea, not on the island of Ireland. He accepted a deal that he and the hardline Brexiteers had previously claimed - with some justification - would mean a part of the UK will remain, from a trade and regulatory perspective, in the EU. But the EU also blinked. When it came to it, it preferred to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and make some token, but politically important, drafting changes, to sticking to its public line and forcing a cliff edge for its own businesses that trade with the UK. So what would that look like this time? The withdrawal agreement is clear: unless both sides agree to an extension by July, it can't happen. And the UK is also now clear: there can be no such extension. There is no obvious way through, either legally or politically. And yet, when November comes, and we're faced with another cliff edge, and another deadline, will either side want to force us over? Recent history says no. Of course, it won't be called an 'extension'ù, and what happens next won't be called 'transition'ù. Both political and legal flexibility will be required on both sides. But the fundamental interests of both sides in preserving the status quo will remain. So I'm willing to make a bet - with the aforementioned Rogers, no less - that come January 2021, one way or another, the UK will - more than four years after the referendum - still be in the single market. In little over a year, we'll find out who was right. '¢ Jonathan Portes is a senior fellow at UK in a Changing Europe ",0,Neutral
Unions colluded in the fiction that Corbyn's plan was going to win power,0,Neutral,"So, although more than 17 million people voted for parties that wanted a second referendum compared with fewer than 15 million who did not, on 31 January Britain will leave the EU on Boris Johnson's terrible deal. What he presents as an irrefutable, unarguable validation of Brexit is in truth a democratic travesty. When Brexit goes wrong, as it will, there will be a reckoning - if a sufficiently viable opposition exists to force it. Tactical voting had some successes, but so precipitate was the drop in the Labour vote and so resilient the Tory one that it was overwhelmed. Looking back, it is obvious that the Labour party should have joined the Remain alliance to avoid splitting the Remain vote, and its point-blank refusal to do so should not have been accepted so tamely. The country would have been voting for what it needs: staying in the EU at a perilous moment in world trade in order to secure vital economic growth, while launching a wholesale programme of national reconstruction and the resetting of its broken capitalism. The Tory party - not the Labour party - would be facing questions over its purpose and future. But even to write this paragraph is to recognise its impossibility. Simple majoritarianism is embedded in our political culture, and it was never going to be challenged by Jeremy Corbyn, in this context a supreme conservative, and a significant part of the Labour party. Instead, the mission on 12 December was to seek a mandate in a winner-take-all system for their radical socialist manifesto. The building of a broad coalition in today's very particular circumstances, along with the overt political compromises, was not the political project. It was anathema, particularly to the sect that had won control of the Labour party. The paradox is that, had the party had an electable would-be prime minister it would not have needed the Remain alliance. The double paradox is that had Corbyn been part of it and thus potential leader of even a putative interim government, its vote share would have nosedived. Our country may be quietly liberal, tolerant and good-natured - but it is also quietly and deeply patriotic. For too many, particularly in the working class, a vote for an apologist for the IRA and Hamas, an indulger of antisemitism and a convinced pacifist was an unpatriotic, anti-British act - however much they might sympathise with the direction of economic and social policy. Johnson might be a narcissist, a twister, a liar and a toff - but in his witty one-liners and breezy optimism they recognised him, however rogue and untrustworthy, as a member of the English officer class, on the battlefield, at least. Corbyn, in contrast, would have been at home as a conscientious objector. You can respect that position. But a majority of the British will never elect such a man their prime minister. A more surefooted Labour movement would have recognised this brutal truth from the beginning. Time was when the leadership of the trade unions, genuinely in touch with popular values, would have simply vetoed Corbyn's candidature - or seen their error and dispatched him and his coterie. In this respect, Len McCluskey and the group at the top of Unite who backed Corbyn so uncompromisingly are also part of the crisis now engulfing Labour. They did so because they believed he would lead them to the promised socialist land - of which the 2019 manifesto was the quintessential expression, although on Friday McCluskey said it contained an 'incontinent rush of policies'ù. I do not doubt Corbyn's decency and his devotion to peace. But if you want to win a British general election with our toxic rightwing press, the precondition is a plausible leader and a feasible programme of government. Corbyn and Corbynism were neither. The danger now is that his followers will take no responsibility for what happened, lionise him as a martyred messiah and turn the 2019 manifesto into an unchallengeable icon. It is no such thing. It is true that no member of the liberal left can seriously challenge its laudable ends - a much more equal society, a transformation of our economic base to meet the environmental emergency and radically improved public services based on inclusion and universalism. But the trouble was the means. This was an indiscriminate, fantastically expensive statist push on all fronts - alongside some measures, like wholesale semi-confiscatory nationalisation, unnecessary to achieve the stated ends. There was no recognition that a vibrant, purpose-driven private sector is an indispensable part of any economic structure - and no attempt was offered to conjure it into being. Instead, the state and its agencies were to become Britain's economic drivers. It stretched credibility to the limits. All this can and must be recast, especially as Johnson attempts to develop a wholly unthought-through 'one-nation'prospectus, while preserving the powerful nexus of private equity and hedge fund operators who prey so destructively on British business and finance. They are his funders. Labour - and the Lib Dems who once again mistakenly retreated from a substantive critique of Britain's capitalist structures - must have a credible alternative. Nor must the Corbyn clique be allowed to blame Brexit for the cataclysm. There are two million more Remainers than Leavers, the Tories own the Leave vote and Brexit is about to become deeply unpopular as it becomes clear that Johnson's promises lead to the hardest of Brexits, with the spate of plant closures and disinvestment accelerating. Nor is there a majority in the country for a one-sided trade deal with the US. The right position in both principle and practice is to remain pro-EU, even though the country may be hyper-weary of the Brexit deadlock. Equally, Labour must be constitutionally creative. The Corbynite proposition that all Scotland wanted was Corbyn-style socialism was total nonsense. Only a full-blooded new federal deal has the remotest chance of saving the union - and enfranchising left-behind England. Is any of this possible? It may be that the McCluskey, Momentum and Corbynite hold on Labour is impossible to challenge. In which case it will be broken as an electoral force. Parties do not have God-given rights to prosper. Nor do countries. Britain, like declining civilisations before it, could be locked in an irresistible downward vortex. Unless a viable Labour party can be created fast, Britain is entering the same pit. '¢ Will Hutton is an Observer columnist ",-0.5,Negative
Don't look to Labour to defend the institutions Johnson seeks to destroy,0,Neutral,"A defeat as crushing as the centre-left suffered on Thursday night leaves it at the mercy of its opponents. Of all the necessary mental adjustments, this will be the hardest to make. The world of the 2010s is over. From 2010 to 2015, the Conservatives were in coalition, and the Liberal Democrats could moderate their excesses. From 2015 to 2019, the Conservatives had a small majority and then no majority. Backbenchers and rebel alliances were free to dictate policy as if we were reliving the 19th century. Opposition could be felt and heard. Now the Remain cause, or the hope that Britain can have a Brexit that protects jobs and living standards, the fine projects to reform the constitution and combat global warming, relieve poverty and reduce inequality, are dead and gone without hope of resurrection. In case you've forgotten or are too young to have learned, defeat can be total in Britain. Long before anyone cared about Donald Trump or Viktor Orb√°n, the late Lord Hailsham described Britain as an 'elective dictatorship'ù. A prime minister could win a large majority on a minority of the votes and party discipline, an enfeebled second chamber, and the corrupt arts of patronage would ensure the government got its way. The point about dictatorships, elective or otherwise, is that they decide whether to be enlightened or repressive. It's the Tories' choice now, not yours or mine. 'I have always depended on the kindness of strangers,'says Blanche Dubois in A Streetcar Named Desire as she is carried off to the asylum. The left's defeat means Britain now depends on the kindness of Tories as they carry us away. A hopeless dependency it is likely to be because, if you can shake the arrogant belief that we are exempt from the squalid movements that are shaping the world, you can make a good case that Johnson will follow other strongmen and use his power to crush dissent. He has already tried to shut down our supposedly sovereign parliament because it would not let him have his way. When Channel 4 politely pointed out that Johnson was ducking campaign debates, he threatened to review its licence. When the BBC highlighted his failure to submit to scrutiny, he threatened to abolish the licence fee. The Conservative party pumped out lies in the election campaign and put up fake Twitter accounts with the brass neck of a fraudster. The dangerous lesson they have learned from their victory is that they can subvert institutions, display a contempt for parliamentary democracy, lie without restraint and - guess what? - there is no political price to pay whatsoever. An ominous passage in the Conservative manifesto says the new government will 'need to look at the broader aspects of our constitution: the relationship between the government, parliament and the courts; the functioning of the royal prerogative; the role of the House of Lords; and access to justice for ordinary people'ù. There's talk of making it harder to scrutinise the security services and limiting the judicial review of ministers' decisions by judges to ensure 'it is not abused to conduct politics by another means'ù. Does this mean Johnson can now claim he has a mandate to bulldoze opposition? Will he want to be remembered as the prime minister who abolished The Archers? His friends from his days in journalism say he's never believed in anything very much and is a liberal at heart. I don't buy it. Johnson may decide to hold on to his new electoral coalition by pandering to fears about Muslims and crime, as Trump would advise. He can appeal to working- and middle-class voters by becoming a home counties Nicola Sturgeon and turning the Conservatives into the English National Party. Perhaps I am wrong, although his willingness to purge authentically liberal Conservative MPs suggests I am anything but. The point about a total defeat remains that we are reduced to speculating on what is in Johnson's heart, assuming he has a heart, and making ourselves dependent on his moods and whims. Power and the ability to shape or even influence events has passed decisively from us. The normal constraint on the elite is the fear that the opposition will supplant the government. It doesn't exist in England. No Tory will fear the rancid rabble of student politicians who make up the Labour leadership, and not only because they failed so abysmally last week. Although they say they hate the Tories, the far left cannot oppose them because they share too many of their worst instincts. Brexit set the pattern. Labour could not lead on the greatest issue of our age because its leader thought in all seriousness he could be 'neutral'ù. It would not expose Johnson's false claims that he could 'get Brexit done'because it was too conflicted to talk about Brexit at all. The same will apply to a Conservative assault on the institutions of liberal democracy. The far left will not defend the independence of Channel 4 and the BBC because they no more believe in a free press than the right. (You may have noticed that Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters are as eager to attack the BBC as the most morally compromised Telegraph columnist.) They don't recognise the independence of the judiciary or civil service either. They believe they are the tools of the bourgeois state, and cannot defend what they have never supported. The conventional thing to say after a defeat of this magnitude is that we must pick ourselves up and return to the battle. You can guarantee that someone will mount the stage and say we must remember how we felt on Thursday night and resolve never to feel that pain again. Indeed we must. But given the far left's death grip on the throat of the Labour party and the failure of the Liberal Democrats and Greens to break through, no one can describe what a comeback would look like or how it would work. This is the best definition of a total defeat I know.

A victory won by Brexit lies does not make those lies true,0.5,Positive,"The Chinese proverb is 'be careful what you wish for'ù. My own adapted version is 'be careful what you vote for'ù. I make no apology for having devoted so many columns to what on Thursday became the lost cause of Remain. The pro-European cause in this country has, alas, suffered from a colossal failure of leadership. The failure to make the case for our EU membership goes back a long way, as does the drip-drip of the vile anti-European campaign in the Murdoch press, and the obvious suspects in other sections of the media. The sequence of events was well brought out in Denis MacShane's prophetic book Brexit - How Britain Will Leave Europe in 2015. (What lies in store is outlined both in MacShane's latest volume, Brexiternity, and Sir Ivan Rogers's recent magisterial lecture at Glasgow University.) As MacShane wrote in 2015: 'The referendum on Europe is not on the benefits or cost of EU membership, but a wider protest about economic and social change which appears inside Britain to produce as many losers as winners.'It was always easy to blame 'Brussels'for policies that became controversial, even when those policies were initiated by successive UK governments themselves. One of the leading perpetrators of lies about Europe was, of course, the Telegraph's former Brussels correspondent himself: Boris Johnson. Johnson is such a master of what his putative hero Winston Churchill called 'terminological inexactitudes'that nothing he claimed during the campaign or the morning of his victory can be taken at face value. 'One-nation Conservatism'ù? Governing for the interests of those northerners who have 'lent him their votes'ù? Pull the other one! How does that compare with his plans for deregulation, closer alignment with Trump's America, and the opportunities for profiting from Brexit to which his financial backers look forward? As Rogers said in his Glasgow lecture, Johnson's claim that we will 'not suffer any downside in terms of market access into easily our biggest market for goods and services '¶ is clearly untrue. It does not get any truer through endless repetition.'The nation has been the victim of a gigantic con trick on the part of the Leave campaign. The nonsensical propaganda about 'getting Brexit done'was finally too much for the counsellor in the British embassy in Washington who resigned recently because she could no longer face peddling a misleading line. But back to failures of leadership: Jeremy Corbyn's failure was on an epic scale. Reputedly a Leaver himself, he made a huge mistake in thinking that, by equivocating over the referendum, he could somehow please those supposedly natural Labour voters in the Midlands and the north who had voted Leave in the referendum. The election showed that too many of them merely laughed in his face. It seems that the election was also a referendum on Corbyn. There has been, and will continue to be, endless speculation about the reasons why the electorate distrusted him even more than Johnson. But historically there seems to me a simple, fundamental cause, whatever the deficiencies in Corbyn personally. In the early 1980s the sensible centre of the Labour party fought the extreme left - then known as the Militant Tendency, not Momentum - and saw them off. The late Denis Healey played a crucial role, as did Neil Kinnock and Roy Hattersley. And the moderate left in Britain and continental Europe watched the failure of President Mitterrand's experiment with 'socialism in one country'between 1981 and 1983 and learned the lesson. Among those who learned the lesson was Mitterrand himself. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown also took note. Alas, this time the extreme left captured the Labour party, with the results we now see. For reasons that I fail to understand, Corbyn and his allies, such as Seumas Milne, believe that the EU is some kind of capitalist conspiracy. Despite the many doubts about Corbyn himself, if he had not equivocated and campaigned vigorously in favour of Remain and a referendum with no ifs or buts, there might well have been a hung parliament and deals which could have contained Corbyn's wilder plans. Also, the hapless Jo Swinson should not have made the strategic mistake of ruling out the second referendum her party had previously espoused. However, we are where we are. The Brexit and Conservative party is going to 'deliver'Brexit. But so far from 'getting Brexit done'ù, the election result means that Brexit has only just begun. Is the British public bored by Brexit talk? I am sorry, but there is a lot more boredom in store, and goodness knows how much economic damage from leaving the single market - the creation of which was, ironically, considered by Kenneth Clarke as Margaret Thatcher's greatest achievement. Happy Christmas! ",0,Neutral
"Scottish independence vote a 'democratic right', says Sturgeon",0.5,Positive,"Nicola Sturgeon is to publish a blueprint next week for a new Scottish independence referendum but Boris Johnson has rejected any moves towards a fresh vote. The first minister said the Scottish National party's 'overwhelming'election victory in Scotland, where it won 47 of the country's 59 Westminster seats with 1.2m votes, gave her a clear and undeniable mandate to hold one. Sturgeon said she would publish the 'detailed democratic case'for the transfer of the legal powers from Johnson's new Conservative government, which has to authorise the Scottish parliament to stage any referendum that changes the UK's constitutional structures. 'This isn't about asking Boris Johnson or any other Westminster politician for permission. This is instead an assertion of the democratic right of the people of Scotland to determine our own future,'she said in a short victory speech in Edinburgh, where she declined to take questions. But Johnson moved quickly to head off her challenge, restating in a telephone call to the SNP leader on Friday evening his implacable opposition to a second referendum. A Downing Street spokesperson said the prime minister had reiterated 'his unwavering commitment to strengthening the union'ù. 'The prime minister made clear how he remained opposed to a second independence referendum, standing with the majority of people in Scotland who do not want to return to division and uncertainty. He added how the result of the 2014 referendum was decisive and should be respected.'The SNP's landslide, winning 45% of the popular vote, resulted in defeat for Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, as well as seven Conservative MPs - leaving the Tories with six Scottish seats - and the near wipeout of Scottish Labour. Despite winning 510,000 votes across Scotland, Labour was left again with a single MP, Ian Murray in Edinburgh South. Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, refused to hold a press conference on Friday and will face questions within the party about his future. He called an emergency meeting of Labour's Scottish executive committee in Glasgow on Saturday. Leonard eventually released a statement at 5.30pm on Friday, describing the results as 'devastating'ù. Insisting that he was now looking ahead to the 2021 Scottish parliament elections, Leonard said his party must listen to voters: 'Constitutional issues have played a major role in our defeat. It is clear that we must do more to win back the trust of people on both sides of the Brexit and Scottish independence debates. 'But more importantly, we must bring people together. The only future for Scotland, and for Scottish Labour, will be found in bringing together our communities on the basis of the overwhelming common interest that working people have - whether they are yes or no [on independence], leave or remain.'The Lib Dems took four seats, including that of North East Fife, where Wendy Chamberlain unseated the SNP's foreign affairs spokesman Stephen Gethins after heavy tactical voting against the SNP by Tory supporters. A final seat was won by the former SNP candidate Neale Hanvey, who was sacked after nominations closed for making antisemitic posts and who defeated Jeremy Corbyn's shadow Scottish secretary, Lesley Laird, in a Fife seat once held by Gordon Brown. Sturgeon said the scale of the victory proved again that a large majority of Scots wanted to remain in the EU, three years after the country voted against Brexit by 62% to 38%. The election was a 'watershed moment'ù, she said. 'Westminster has ignored the people of Scotland for more than three years. Last night, the people of Scotland said enough,'Sturgeon said. 'It's time for Boris Johnson to start listening. I accept, regretfully, that he has a mandate for Brexit in England but he has no mandate whatsoever to take Scotland out of the EU.'She made a direct appeal to EU citizens - a group expected to be given a vote in any independence referendum, saying the SNP would protect and champion their interests. 'I will fight with everything I have to protect your right to call Scotland your home.'Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Tories' interim leader, admitted their loss of seven seats was a disappointment but denied he was downhearted by a 3.5% fall in support for the Conservatives in Scotland. 'The story across the whole of the UK was the collapse of the Labour party,'he told a press conference in Glasgow. Carlaw said he had spoken briefly to the prime minister on Friday morning. Johnson would challenge Sturgeon's claims there was now an undeniable mandate for a referendum, by presenting 'a unifying agenda that will put strengthening the union at its heart'in his Queen's speech next week. Carlaw accused Sturgeon of deceiving voters. 'Up until 10pm last night [it] was about stopping Brexit and stopping Boris. Nonetheless, the SNP is reverting to form and deciding to take the vote it won yesterday as a free pass for a referendum next year,'he said. Sturgeon avoided claiming the results were a mandate for independence: most opinion polls beforehand showed a narrow lead for those voters who want to remain in the UK. One poll days before the election cut support for independence by five points, to 44%. However, a number of polls had also shown that support for independence would shift above 50% if Johnson were to win an election and implement Brexit - a stance Sturgeon will now want to carefully build on. She will emphasise the deep political differences between Scotland and England and argue that any moves to enforce Brexit across the UK proves there is a substantial democratic deficit that can only be solved with independence.

This defeat leaves Labour support unrecognisable from 35 years ago,-0.875,Negative,"Each election invites us to revisit the lessons of the previous one. Just as the 2017 election showed that while a lot of people had an appetite for change and Labour policies, they had not been willing to embrace Ed Miliband as a leader in 2015, the 2019 election sheds a harsh light on how poor a campaigner Theresa May proved to be in 2017. Boris Johnson, avoiding the media and repeating platitudes as banal as the Maybot, unlocked the mandate that she sought last time around. It was an expertly timed election, thanks as much to the blunders of Jo Swinson and Jeremy Corbyn as to the Machiavellian planning of Johnson and Dominic Cummings. Running against chaos worked for Cameron in 2015, and even more so for the Tories in 2019. The Conservative victory was comprehensive. Their share of the vote, at 43.6% across the UK, was slightly higher than Labour achieved in 1997 (43.2%) but not quite up to the achievements of Thatcher in 1979 (43.9%) or Heath in 1970 (46.4%). But it is fair to say that it is the biggest share of the vote for a party in the contemporary era. Their achievement after nine years of government of receiving swings of 10-15% from the main opposition across swathes of constituencies is unequalled. Other than on slightly technical occasions such as 1931 and 1906, when a government was formed slightly in advance of an election, the Conservatives have enjoyed the most emphatic upgrade to their mandate of any government in British history. Their popular vote lead of 11.4% over the main alternative is more or less what Thatcher achieved in 1987 but a little less than what Blair and Thatcher managed in 1997 and 1983. Although the Conservative majority stopped short of three figures, it is not unreasonable to think of the 2019 election as a landslide. Jeremy Corbyn has done a favour to Michael Foot's historical reputation in displacing his 1983 haul of 209 seats as the worst Labour performance in the post-1945 era. But beyond that simple fact, the comparison between 1983 and 2019 tells an interesting tale. Although the total number of seats is similar, it is amazing how little the diminished remnant of Labour Britain in 2019 has in common with its counterpart in 1983. There are 105 seats, give and take for boundary changes, that were Labour in both elections, and therefore nearly the same number that switched in one direction or the other between 1983 and 2019. The seats that Labour has lost since 1983 are rural and town seats in the Midlands and north, and Scottish seats lost in the destruction that the party has endured at the hands of the SNP. The seats that Labour has gained are mostly in London, and various pleasant suburbs and university towns. In 1983 the Economist wrote that to find a Labour seat, one needed to look in impoverished inner cities and crashed-out towns with obsolete economies - in 2019 one needs to find a pro-European, highly educated enclave huddling around a university. And yet, the electorate was unenthusiastic. Contrary to the excited claims on social media on election day, turnout was down on 2017. The vile weather offered an escape route for electors wrestling with uncomfortable choices; perhaps had things been a little different the Labour leavers thinking of voting Tory would have opted out. But as it was, it looks as if the unenthusiastic voters of the Midlands and north who might have given a grudging Labour vote did not feel motivated enough to brave the rain. While Corbyn was unpopular, Johnson was not loved. But the political system does not recognise unenthusiastic mandates: a big majority gives a party the power to do more or less what it likes and there are few constraints. It is up to the magnanimity of the Conservative party whether the full, vague promise of Page 48 of the party's manifesto, and the removal of checks to executive power, comes to pass. It is also up to the honour of Johnson whether anything is done to update Britain's electoral laws to cope with dark money, blatant lying and obscure online advertising. This, rather than minor tweaks such as voter ID and boundary changes, makes the election due in 2024 potentially even less of a joyous festival of democracy than 2019.

Whether or not this generation turns out to vote in sufficient numbers - and the onus is on Labour to inspire them to do so - could determine whether Britain becomes the plaything of a deceitful charlatan for five years, or whether the ceaseless war against their futures finally ends. It is not all about age, of course. A slice of Britain's youth live a gilded life, no doubt concentrated in the 18% of under-25s planning to vote for a continuation of ruinous Tory rule. But the balance sheet for younger Britain - to be generous, I'll include the 18-year-old on a plumbing apprenticeship and a 36-year-old nurse with two kids - is stark and chilling. As the Resolution Foundation showed last year, millennials have endured a decline in living standards on most measures. No wonder, then, that one poll found half of them believed today's young people would have a worse lot than their parents, with just 22% believing things would improve. Nearly one in three born at the end of the 1980s were in a low-paying job in their mid-20s; for those born in the early 1960s, it was a quarter.  It was the wages of young workers that suffered the most, because of a fateful combination of the crash and Tory-Lib Dem austerity. An astonishing one in five young people are, in violation of the law, being paid less than the minimum wage, which is itself insufficient to live on. Child poverty is hurtling towards 40%; growing up in hardship damages the prospects of its victims throughout their lives. Youth services budgets have been hammered by cuts of 69%. Real-terms cuts to social security, whether to tax credits or housing benefit, have pummelled the young. An ever-escalating housing crisis has become a defining feature in their lives as home ownership collapses, with half as many young adults on middle incomes owning a home compared with 20 years earlier, and what's left of council housing not being an option for the vast majority. Instead young people are driven into a rip-off and insecure private rented sector. In 1980 a private tenant on average spent 10% of their income on rent. That has now surged to 30%, and in London someone in their 20s on an average income can expect to spend 55% of their pay packet on an average one-bedroom flat. No wonder a million more young adults live with their parents compared with 20 years ago, with all the pressures and strains that places on family life.  This is a generation that has been saddled with debt for daring to aspire to a university education from which all of society benefits. Students in England can now expect to graduate with an average debt of more than £50,000, and even having acquired this millstone, a quarter are in low-skilled work a decade after graduating. Young people are increasingly unable to afford a car - driving licence numbers among this generation have plummeted in the last 25 years - yet bus services outside the capital are expensive and unreliable, while train fares are extortionate. Young people were promised freedom and prosperity: instead they were burdened with insecurity and stagnation. Then there's the relentless attempt to belittle and insult the values they hold dear. Young people were mostly angered by Brexit not because of some sentimental attachment to EU institutions, but because of the cultural counter-revolution waged by Tory Brexiteers in its wake. Young people are pro-LGBT and antiracist, and yet they are lumbered with a government headed by a man who calls gay people 'bum boys'ù, whose cabinet has no openly LGBT ministers but several who voted against LBGT civil liberties, who baits Muslims and black people, and who menaces migrants and refugees. There is nothing inevitable about young people rejecting the Tories. When Margaret Thatcher secured her 1983 landslide, she did so with a nine-point lead among under 25s. When Theresa May lost her majority, it was partly thanks to Labour's 35-point lead in the same age group; polling now suggests that advantage has extended to 42 points. Britain's young could prove themselves to be our political saviours. They have endured a decade of assaults on their living standards and their beliefs. The Tory elite calculated that this onslaught would have no political consequences because young people would not vote in sufficient numbers for it to matter. This hubris finally collided with reality in 2017, but it was not enough. And so this is the question that will soon be answered. Will enough young people march to polling stations, in the right places, to stop a hard-right Tory government committed to implementing hard Brexit by the end of next month? Will Boris Johnson's entitlement meet its nemesis in the shape of a revolt of the young? There is very little time left. But if Britain's nightmare finally ends, it will probably be the young who save us from it. '¢ Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist ",0,Neutral

Brexit hits UK ski and holiday staff overseas,0,Neutral,"A third of UK seasonal jobs in ski resorts and summer activity holidays have disappeared because of fears over Brexit, research shows. A year after the industry warned that 25,000 jobs were at risk, a survey of 65 independent travel specialists including Mark Warner, Ski World and festive operators in Lapland revealed that a third - 1,700 among those polled - had already gone. Industry leaders have said their business models are not sustainable outside the EU because companies will no longer be able to hire and deploy British staff on temporary contracts post Brexit. 'What came back in the survey was that a large number of owners are actually looking to sell, they say 'òwe are contemplating shutting down' or 'òwe will just close down because it is not viable','said Charles Owen, the co-founder of Seasonal Business in Travel (SBIT), which commissioned the survey. He runs Jack's bar in the Meribel ski resort in the French Alps and says owners are 'terrified'of a post-Brexit future. Many are looking at closing down, he says, threatening a £16bn contribution to Britain's economy, £1bn of which goes directly to the Exchequer in tax receipts. The figures come a year after SBIT warned that Alpine resort holidays were being jeopardised by Brexit and the end of what is known as 'posted worker'rules, which allow any citizen of one member state to work in another for up to two years but continue employment as a worker paying tax in their home country. This has allowed specialist holiday operators in the Alps and elsewhere to mushroom as they typically use British staff for every stage of the package from the meet and greet and airport transfers, to child minding and cooking and cleaning services. 'Everybody thinks freedom of movement is just about Polish plumbers and painters coming to England, but it's not, it's also about UK nationals being able to go to Europe and work a season in a ski resort or on a summer activity holiday,'said Owen. 'There are about 25,000 workers in our sector and almost all of them are British.'Brexit will also affect others outside the travel sector who work in the EU on short-term contracts but remain on British books paying tax and national insurance contributions as if they were living in the UK. The IT sector across Europe also typically employs people on short-term contracts. The latest EU data shows that 49,496 British nationals are 'posted workers'ù, issued with the A1 tax certificate which logs their contributions in their home state. Owen says he has a break clause in his contract to run Jack's pub that will allow him to stop operating if the posted worker arrangements expire because of Brexit. Dan Fox, the managing director of Ski Weekends, said the EU had 'brought us the most incredible benefits of freedom of movement of our staff, transport and resources'ù, and holidaymakers had benefited because of the explosion in small companies able to offer a diverse range of holidays.

"Brexit deal includes two-way customs checks, insists Ireland",0,Neutral,"Simon Coveney, Ireland's foreign minister, has challenged Boris Johnson's claim that under his Brexit deal there would be no checks or controls on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Britain. Coveney insisted that under the terms of the withdrawal agreement the prime minister negotiated with the European Union there would be inspections on goods moving in both directions. 'It was very clear when the deal was done,'he said in Brussels on Monday. 'The EU has made it clear they want to minimise the impact on goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but at the same time goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will need to have some checks to ensure that the EU knows what is potentially coming into their market through Northern Ireland.'The comments contradicted Johnson's claims, repeated last Sunday, that there would be no checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. Coveney's tacit rebuke followed sharper censure on Monday from Arlene Foster, the Democratic Unionist party leader, who accused the prime minister of misrepresenting the Brexit deal and breaking his word to Northern Ireland. Speaking to RTE, the Irish foreign minister said negotiators on both sides spent a lot of time nailing down details to leave no ambiguity. 'Goods going the other way from Northern Ireland into Great Britain will have far less requirement for checks at all. In fact, it will probably be limited to an export declaration, because, of course, that is a matter internally for the UK. 'So, there was always a distinction between goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland versus goods going from Northern Ireland into Great Britain and we spent many hours discussing and negotiating that, and I think explaining it too.'Coveney added that clinching a trade deal with the UK by the end of 2020 was a 'tall order'ù. Johnson, who was due on Wednesday to campaign in the Midlands and north-west England, has been accused of lying about the Brexit deal and the likelihood of securing a trade deal within a year. A document leaked last week, written by officials in the government's Brexit department, warned that Johnson's stated goal of implementing his deal by the end of 2020 presented a major challenge because of the need to create new protocols and systems for business in Northern Ireland. The document, obtained by the Financial Times, claimed that 98% of export businesses were 'likely to struggle to bear the cost'of the extra paperwork, fuelling concerns of increased prices for consumers. The government dismissed a similar document leaked to the Labour party on Friday as instant analysis done when Johnson brought home his Brexit deal in October. ",0.75,Positive
"Russia involved in leak of papers saying NHS is for sale, says Reddit",0,Neutral,"An anonymous online poster who disseminated documents later brandished by Jeremy Corbyn as evidence the Conservatives would put the NHS 'on the table'in US trade talks was part of a campaign directed by Moscow, the site hosting the papers has said. On Friday evening, Reddit confirmed it has banned 61 accounts; including that of a user called Gregoriator, who it believes was part of a Russian information operation known as Secondary Infektion. The anonymous user posted copies of the leaked official documents on the site in late October. Corbyn presented the same documents at a news conference last week, saying they 'leave Boris Johnson's denials [that the NHS would be for sale] in absolute tatters'and touting them as 'evidence that, under Boris Johnson, the NHS is on the table and will be up for sale'ù. Reddit insisted the post garnered minimal interest at the time and Labour has declined to reveal where it obtained the documents. The government has said it believes they are genuine. However, questions will now be asked about whether Russia had a hand in introducing the papers into the UK's public discourse and, if so, what its motivations were for doing so. Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, said it was 'extremely serious'that the leaked documents could be linked to a Russian disinformation campaign. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday, Morgan said: 'I understand from what was being put on that website, those who seem to know about these things say that it seems to have all the hallmarks of some form of interference. 'And if that is the case, that obviously is extremely serious. And actually as culture secretary, obviously one of the things that we are looking for and monitoring is any interference in our elections.' The news also highlighted the vulnerability of the UK's democratic processes to Moscow's influence and will put pressure on Johnson over his refusal to release the parliamentary report into Russian meddling before the general election. It led Dominic Grieve, the former chair of the parliamentary committee that put together the report, to renew his criticism of Johnson on Friday evening. He said it was 'unfortunate'the document had been shelved for what he believed were 'wholly dishonest'reasons and called for its publication. Johnson has previously claimed there was insufficient time before the election but Grieve has pointed out the report had been signed off by the intelligence services and such documents are routinely published within significantly shorter timeframes. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, renewed calls for the government to allow a report detailing Russian interference in UK elections to be published. He said: 'If we want to get to the bottom of the extent to which the Russian state interferes in elections, can we please publish the intelligence and security committee report? Let's get that out there. That should have been published ages ago.' On Monday, the social media research firm Graphika said that, while it could not definitively prove the Gregoriator account was controlled by Moscow, its methods closely resembled 'techniques used by Secondary Infektion in the past, a known Russian operation'ù. It identified similarities, including grammatical errors in the early distribution of the documents via Reddit, three German-language websites and an anonymous Twitter account. Secondary Infektion is the name given to a Russian operation exposed by Facebook earlier this year, operating across six languages and dozens of platforms. Subsequent analysis by the Atlantic Council, a US thinktank, demonstrated it was behind a string of largely failed attempts to disseminate fake news, including a blatantly false story that British remainers were planning to assassinate Johnson. Announcing its move on Friday, Reddit said: 'We were recently made aware of a post on Reddit that included leaked documents from the UK. We investigated this account and the accounts connected to it and today we believe this was part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia.'The site said it had found a 'pattern of coordination'similar to that seen among social media accounts linked to Secondary Infektion, leading it to 'use these accounts to identify additional suspect accounts that were part of the campaign on Reddit'ù. A Labour spokesman said: 'These documents reveal the plot against our NHS. And of course neither the UK nor the US government have denied their authenticity. Our releasing them to journalists was clearly in the public interest.'The Conservatives have not responded to a request for comment. ",-0.5,Negative
Johnson's 'get Brexit done' strategy resonates with marginal focus groups,0.5,Positive,"Amid ongoing concern from Labour strategists about whether the party can hold on to the support of leave voters in marginal seats, focus groups conducted for the Guardian this week suggested Boris Johnson's 'get Brexit done'strategy was cutting through. In Rainham in Essex, a group of leave voters, some of whom had voted Labour in the past, spoke warmly about the prime minister. And if his endlessly repeated mantra was familiar, warnings about his character appeared to have made less of an impact. 'I don't necessarily agree with everything he says, but he cheers me up,'said Sarah (participants agreed to be referred to by their first names). 'He's like a puppy: you can't kick a puppy,'said Norman . 'He reminds me of a bog brush: I like him!'said Lisa. Labour strategists are particularly concerned about the party's appeal among its traditional supporters in Brexit-voting areas, who may be susceptible to Johnson's signature pledge. There was a sense among the leave group that the prime minister was capable of getting things done - an alluring characteristic to voters deeply frustrated by three and a half years of Brexit stasis. 'You don't want someone indecisive,'said Michael. Asked to describe the Tories in one word or phrase, he said they were 'bullish'ù. Asked what he meant by that, he said: 'It's good but it's also bad. They're just ruthless.'The Essex seat of Dagenham and Rainham is held by Labour's Jon Cruddas, with a majority of 4,652. Asked to identify the most pressing issues in the constituency, each group - leavers and remainers - came up with very similar lists: health service cuts, crime and affordable housing all featured prominently. 'It's not for the likes of us,'said Lisa, a leave voter, referring to a housing development going up nearby on land that used to be part of Ford's vast Dagenham plant. Rather than blaming Boris Johnson and the Tory governments that preceded his, several of the Brexiters pointed the finger at Cruddas for failing to secure improvements for his constituents. Cruddas held the seat in 2017 with a majority of less than 5,000; but the perception was that he doesn't have to fight hard for it. 'Every election time he's probably sitting back in his seat, having a spa, thinking: 'òYeah, I've got this in the bag,''said Michael, to general laughter. The leavers also raised questions about the slew of giveaways in Labour's manifesto, from free broadband to restoring the pensions of Waspi women. 'Where is all this money, this funding, these people coming from?'said Elaine. 'You can't keep taxing working people.'Asked to come up with a single word or phrase that represents each of the two main parties, Labour was 'broken promises'or 'everything promised'ù. There was a palpable nostalgia for the leaders of the past, who appeared more decisive. 'Thatcher would have got you out, straight away,'said Lisa. Dave, a lifelong Labour voter, agreed. 'While I didn't respect her politics, I had a lot of respect for her as a woman,'he said. At the end of the conversation, two of the group said they had voted Labour in the past, but were expecting to cast their vote next week for 'Boris'ù. The second focus group, composed of voters who supported remain in 2016, was more solidly Labour - the Lib Dems were barely mentioned, and several of Labour's most eye-catching manifesto pledges had hit home, including free broadband. Matt said deciding how to vote this time had been tricky. 'I don't know if Corbyn is the right guy to lead the country; but I do think he's a damn sight better than any of the alternatives. It's the best of a bad lot, really,'he said. David agreed. 'I'm Labour, but I don't know if he's the right man or the job. He doesn't feel strong enough for me. He doesn't give off a leadership kind of feeling.'And among this group, Johnson was deeply unpopular - described as sneaky, and some of the things he says 'really cringey'ù. 'He just doesn't care,'said David, adding, 'I can't believe he's prime minister: I don't think he's trustworthy; I don't think he's qualified for the job.'Focus groups are small scale and can only provide qualitative insights; but they can help to shed light on the reasoning behind voters' decisions, and are used by all main parties - including Labour. Asked about where each of the leaders would go on holiday, for Jeremy Corbyn, the answer was a coach trip to Bournemouth; for the Brexit party's Nigel Farage, the Cayman Islands; and for Boris Johnson, it was Las Vegas. 'You'll find him where he shouldn't be, where he's not meant to be,'said Michael. ",0,Neutral
EU distances itself from Johnson's timetable for post-Brexit trade deal,0,Neutral,"EU member states have signalled a refusal to be bounced into Boris Johnson's fast-track timetable to strike a post-Brexit trade deal. If he wins a majority, the prime minister has vowed to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January and agree on a trade deal with the bloc within 11 months, an unprecedentedly short time for such a complex negotiation. Johnson, who has built his election campaign around the misleading slogan 'Get Brexit done'ù, has promised not to extend the 11-month transition period, seen by many as far too short to agree a future relationship with the EU. EU leaders will promise to move 'swiftly'to the next phase of UK negotiations, according to a leaked version of their communique to be adopted at a summit next Friday - the day after the general election. But a reference to 'making the best possible use of the limited time available'that was contained in an earlier version of the text has been dropped. EU ambassadors preparing the document have serious doubts about the 11-month timetable and opposed sending this positive signal to Johnson. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said it would be possible to negotiate a basic free-trade deal with the UK in 11 months. Others are more sceptical, with one senior diplomat saying he could not imagine it in his wildest dreams. Some diplomats are counting on Johnson to abandon his principles, encouraged by earlier U-turns, such as his broken promise to the Democratic Unionist party not to have a border in the Irish Sea, as well as his 'do or die'pledge to leave the EU on 31 October. 'Of course Boris said he would rather die in a ditch; he didn't die in a ditch, but he accepted to go beyond 31 October,'said one senior EU diplomat. 'It is not unlikely that there could be an extension of the transition period.'The diplomat added that Johnson had proved 'more pragmatic than anyone expected'ù. The UK can extend the Brexit transition period once for one or two years, but must agree this extension with the EU before 1 July 2020. The latest EU text also has a reference to 'the level playing field'ù, meaning the UK must respect core EU standards on workers' rights, state aid, and environmental and consumer protection, to reach a deal ensuring zero tariffs and zero quotas on British goods. The document, which may change again, is to be adopted by EU leaders at the summit in Brussels on 13 December. The EU's default scenario is a Johnson victory, but officials have also discussed how to respond to Jeremy Corbyn in No 10, which is seen as less likely. The Labour leader has pledged to 'get Brexit sorted'by negotiating a new deal with the EU in three months and organising a referendum within six. While EU sources see the Corbyn renegotiation timetable as doable, one former government adviser has said it 'seems almost impossible'to organise a referendum in six months. Corbyn's pledge to remain neutral in any referendum on his revised deal 'does not do much for his credibility'ù, the diplomat said. Nonetheless, sources say the EU would engage with a potential prime minister Corbyn, once his government filed a request to delay Brexit and revealed details of its renegotiation plan. The Liberal Democrat MEP Luisa Porritt said: 'This leak shows that, under Boris Johnson, Brexit negotiations are set to drag on and on. The chances of a no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020 are increasing dramatically. 'Unlike Boris Johnson, other European leaders are being honest about how long a free-trade negotiation takes.'",0.125,Positive
Brussels or Washington? Brexit means we must decide whose side we're on,0,Neutral,"It is a common problem, especially at this time of year. You agree to host a party, but when it comes around the timing feels awkward. Work is hectic, some of the guests are barely on speaking terms, someone might make an unpleasant scene. That someone might be you. A less frivolous politician than Boris Johnson could turn this week's Nato summit to his advantage. The international stage allows a hosting prime minister to parade himself as a serious statesman, inviting favourable comparison with a Labour rival whose method for communicating on defence matters has traditionally been a loudhailer at an anti-war rally. But gravitas is outside Johnson's comfortable range as a political performer, no matter how hard he strains for the note. This week's summit contains the additional hazard of Donald Trump chiming in unhelpfully. The prime minister's campaign could easily be undermined by a tone-deaf endorsement. Downing Street's concern on that score has been communicated to Trump, who managed a long press conference on Tuesday without sabotage or scandal. There is still time for both. Affinity with the US president causes difficulty for Johnson inside and outside the summit. To undecided voters it underlines the two men's shared habits of dishonesty and swaggering male chauvinism. For European leaders, the concern is ideological resemblance between Trumpism and Brexit. Both projects look like wrecking-balls swinging into the edifice of rules and institutions that were assembled after the second world war to insure against future conflict. Brexit plots Britain on an axis of nationalistic mischief that fractures solidarity among liberal democratic nations that once had common cause as 'the west'ù. Johnson rejects that characterisation of EU withdrawal. He says it won't diminish Britain's security cooperation with continental allies; that Euroscepticism and Natophilia are compatible. In the short term, that is true (and the longer term hardly intrudes on Johnson's mind). But in other European capitals there is fretting about strategic divergence. There will come a point when trade talks begin and an underprepared British prime minister discovers how binary the choices are between orientation to Brussels or Washington. Johnson imagines a middle way, preserving Britain's traditional role as a diplomatic bridge across the Atlantic, but his election manifesto contains no blueprint for bridge-building. The Eurosceptic belief in Britain as a solo trading power, vassal to no continent, is sustained by imperial nostalgia. Acolytes of that creed are unready for the coming decade, in which combined issues of trade, regulation, technology and security will be thrashed out at inter-continental level. The US, Europe and China are the actors that matter. Their rivalries are expressed in a complex tangle of Trump's tariffs, Brussels' digital directives and Beijing's projection of power through its 'belt and road'infrastructure investments around the world. Middle-weight Britain can choose whose view it prefers, but it is not in a position to dictate terms of its own. Europe is the military weakling in the trio - a vulnerability felt most keenly and expressed least tactfully by Emmanuel Macron, the French president. His recent warning that Nato faced 'brain death'earned rebukes from across the alliance. Trump seems to have been personally affronted, responding on Tuesday that the remark had been 'nasty'ù. But many Nato governments privately share Macron's concern. He had meant to shock, to help his home continent 'wake up'to its need for a self-sufficient security policy, mindful that Washington's defence establishment long ago lost patience with European free-riding. Even before Trump was on the scene the US gripe was that spoilt Germans spend their own money on social policy while American taxpayers buy the weapons that keep them safe. Macron's frustration with the EU's lack of dynamism has made him a tactical ally of Johnson in the Brexit endgame, supporting haste in finalising the divorce so Brussels has more bandwidth for other challenges. Somewhat unusually, the French president also got an approving mention in a speech by Jeremy Corbyn over the weekend. The Labour leader shares Macron's assessment that Nato needs to reset relations with Moscow, although that is probably the limit of overlap between the two men's worldviews. Corbyn is not a recruit to the Gallic agenda for pan-European defence. His speech in response to the London Bridge terror attack was designed to deflect the charge of softness on security issues. To the extent that it contained a foreign policy doctrine, it was the familiar analysis that western military adventures fanned flames of international terror. Under a Labour government British soldiers would be reserved for UN peacekeeping and humanitarian work. Anti-interventionism is a safe space for Corbyn. His core supporters care passionately about it, and a much wider audience agrees on the undesirability of getting bogged down in distant wars. But it is easier to diagnose misuses of British power in the past than to describe the kind of power Britain should be in the future. To meet that challenge, Labour would first need to decide whether it supports EU membership. Corbyn's professed neutrality on that point is defensible as a campaign expedient but not credible as a bid for national leadership; not when the issues have already been debated for three years and voters are having to choose a government next Thursday. A problem shared by Johnson and Corbyn is that Westminster has treated Brexit as primarily an economic debate or a cultural faultline, when it is a strategic choice before it is either of those things. To surrender a seat as one of the three steering powers at the EU's top table has a substantial cost in power and influence. It will not be comfortable for a country thus diminished to spend the coming decade in supplicant stance, knocking on doors, waiting in antechambers, taking rules when it once wrote them. That is true whether you look at it from the left or the right. It continues to be true even when the only two men who might be prime minister after this election collude in pretending otherwise.

The odds are against Remain. But outsiders can still win,0,Neutral,"This is my last column before the 12 December election. At the time of writing, the Conservative Brexit party - for that is what it is - is way ahead in the polls, and the ineffable Johnson is set to take the British economy hurtling towards the cliff edge. He, his henchman Dominic Cummings and their time-serving accomplices have fooled far too many people into believing that, within weeks, they will have 'got Brexit done'ù. This is a monstrous lie, yet even reasonable people, understandably fed up with the way this issue has dominated the news for three-and-a-half years, seem to be resigned to their fate. What few realise is that Brexit would only just have begun, and would be likely to be drawn out for many years, with very unpleasant economic and social consequences. There are some who say: 'Johnson got us into this mess. Now let him sort it out.'There are others who try to rationalise by proclaiming 'he is really a Remainer'ù. Oh yes? You could have fooled me. A man whose father, Stanley, brought home a European commission salary for a significant part of his childhood is paying Europe back in a most insulting and damaging manner, for us and the rest of the EU. The prospects are not pleasing, but I have not given up hope. I have never forgotten that day before the 1992 election, when the odds were 6-1 against the Tories - in other words, £10 staked would net £60 plus your £10 back - yet they won. Given that we do not have proportional representation in this country, the 1992 election was the equivalent of a two-horse race. As I write, the odds of a Conservative overall majority are 3-1 on - that is, a bet of £30 wins only £10 over the return of your stake, while a Labour overall majority is 20-1 against, so if the polls are indeed out of kilter, a stake of £10 would net £200 plus the £10 back. (I spell this out because there is sometimes confusion outside horse racing circles of the difference between odds on and odds against.) The big question this time - and the only one that can offer us Remainers hope - is: is this really a two-horse race? Seldom in my career have I heard so much talk of tactical voting. This is important, because the real problem is, as one friend of mine succinctly put it: 'The Tories have cornered the Brexit market while the Remain vote is split. Labour and the Lib Dems are gifting Boris his Brexit.'This when the polls have been indicating for some time that there has been a pronounced swing in the nation at large in favour of Remain - from 48% on that fatal day in June 2016 to 53% Remain and 47% Leave more recently.  Which brings me to Jo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats. If things go the wrong way on Thursday week, the responsibility will lie principally with the Conservative Brexit party and Jeremy Corbyn's failure of leadership. But what on earth did Swinson think she was doing when Tim Walker, the Liberal Democrat candidate for Canterbury, stepped down tactically to help his fellow Remainer, the Labour candidate, and Swinson proceeded to replace Walker with another candidate? She is also splitting the Remain vote in the constituency of David Gauke, the former Tory turned independent. These are classic micro-examples of the chaos in the Remain camp, even though, as noted, the majority of people in this country - a country that is supposedly a fount of democracy - are Remainers. Which brings us to what was manifestly a strategic error on Swinson's part. For a long time the Lib Dems were sticking out for another referendum, then they spoiled it by saying they would revoke article 50. Now, of course they are right in one sense: the entire Brexit misadventure is an own goal, and in an ideal world article 50 should indeed be revoked - indeed, it should never even have been invoked. But we are where we are, and a second referendum, however risky, would be a legitimate response to those who say 'the people have spoken'ù. The people should be given another chance to reflect. It is more important to honour the wellbeing of the nation than to honour one referendum that was a vehicle for many discontents that had precious little to do with the EU. It looks as though the only feasible route to a second referendum would be via an attempt to resolve the kind of deadlock that would almost certainly arise in a hung parliament. To achieve this, Remainers need to vote tactically for Remain candidates of whatever party. Obvious - but not, apparently, to the leader of the most obviously Remain party. ",-0.25,Negative
"EU risks splits over Brexit trade talks, says new council chief",0,Neutral,"The EU is ready for the next phase of Brexit but risks greater internal divisions over trade talks with the UK, one of its incoming leaders has said. In one of his first interviews since being nominated president of the European council, Charles Michel said Brexit may have played an important role in bringing the EU together. The former Belgian prime minister will take the reins following a formal handover ceremony on Friday in his Europa HQ in Brussels, as Donald Tusk stands down after five years in post. Michel's first big moment will be chairing the EU summit on 12-13 December - election time in the UK. EU leaders will probably be finishing off their three-course dinner when exit polls drop on polling day, revealing whether Boris Johnson's election gamble is likely to have paid off. Michel said he hoped the election would bring clarity on whether the UK would ratify the withdrawal agreement. If Brexit happens on 31 January, the two sides will immediately embark on an 11-month race to negotiate a free-trade agreement. 'We are ready, we know what the most important principles are we want to defend and promote in the next phase,'Michel told the Guardian and six other European newspapers. 'We also know what are the top priorities: the integrity of the single market, the level playing field [fair competition], the Good Friday agreement.'The EU would have to 'work again very hard'to maintain unity, he said, especially as countries had different economic interests in the UK relationship. 'There is a risk to be divided based on different economic situations in different countries. But if we use the same transparent way of working, it is the best guarantee to maintain unity.'Michel declined to predict whether the two sides could agree a trade deal in just 11 months. In the annals of trade talks this would be an unprecedented feat and one senior EU diplomat said he could not see it happening 'in my wildest dreams'ù. Michel said he wanted to avoid Brexit becoming a big issue for the summit, as he planned to focus on the eurozone, climate change and the EU's next seven-year budget. Unlike Tusk, an unabashed anglophile who recently declared 'in my heart I will always be a remainer'ù, the Belgian leader avoids flamboyant statements. 'There are many things in my heart and certainly I also regret the choice, but I respect the choice of the British citizens.'He added it would be important to 'show serenity'in upcoming talks. His priority is making Europe a more united player on the world stage, as he warned against the possibility of the union becoming 'the collateral damage'in a possible cold war between the US and China. 'There is a risk that in the long term, there is a new cold war between the United States and China '¶ I don't think the destiny of Europe is to become a junior partner.'Michel said EU leaders needed 'more strategic discussions'ù, including in dealing with China, before two summits with the country next year. Unlike his predecessor, who once listed Donald Trump's 'worrying declarations'as one of the threats facing Europe, Michel struck an emollient note towards the US. He said the EU and US shared 'the same goals'and many common values, although he noted the two were at odds over climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. The softly spoken son of a former Belgian deputy prime minister, who has been involved in politics since his teenage years, Michel has broken many political records. He was Belgium's youngest-ever minister (aged 24) and youngest-ever prime minister (aged 38) when he formed an unwieldy four-party coalition dominated by Flemish nationalists in 2014. The coalition collapsed in 2018 when Michel insisted on signing a UN migration pact, against the wishes of the larger Flemish nationalist party. Describing himself as a bruggenbouwer (bridge builder), he said his experience in Belgian politics would help him forge compromises among 27 countries. 'Many people say Belgium is a mini-Europe,'he said. Michel, a liberal ally of Emmanuel Macron, is seen as close to France, but sought to stress he was his own man. He said the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was the first EU leader to suggest he consider the European job. He spoke warmly of ideas to reform the EU enlargement process that are closely associated with the French president, who caused uproar by blocking North Macedonia from opening membership talks. 'We need to discuss whether it is possible to improve this process, for example with the possibility to decide the principle of reversibility,'said Michel, referring to a key French idea that countries could be pushed to the back of the queue if sliding back on democratic reforms. While some countries, Denmark and the Netherlands, are sympathetic to the French plans, others in central and eastern European countries are wary. Michel will be only the third person to occupy the job, since the post was created in 2009. Some EU member states complain that being Europe's summiteer-in-chief is only a part-time job, a charge Michel batted away. He said the European council had grown in importance. 'I'm not naive, I know what the obstacles are, but I am hopeful. I feel [there is] stronger political will among the leaders - stronger than is reflected in the media - to take decisions.'",-0.375,Negative
Michael Heseltine calls on voters to back Lib Dems,0,Neutral,"Michael Heseltine, a former Conservative deputy prime minister, has said he cannot support Boris Johnson in the general election because the prime minister is pursuing an 'utterly disastrous'policy that will make Britain poorer and less influential. Lord Heseltine has called on voters to back the Liberal Democrats in the general election to deny Johnson a majority in parliament. The Tory grandee was suspended from the party in May when he said he would support the Lib Dems in the European elections. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday: 'The real issue is what is at stake and it is the prosperity of this country, the world influence of this country, our relationship with our neighbours in Europe. This is transcendingly the overarching issue at stake in this election and I cannot vote or support people who are going to make the country poorer or less influential - full stop, end of story.'Heseltine called for a second referendum and took a swipe at Vote Leave's controversial claim that Turkey and four other countries could join the EU as soon as 2020, and their accession could lead to 5.2 million extra people moving to the UK by 2030. He also attacked its infamous assertion on the side of the campaign bus that Britain sends £350m a week to the EU and that money would be spent on the NHS instead. If you want to vote in the general election on 12 December but haven't yet registered - bad news. It is too late. However, you can still register online so you don't miss out next time. And let's face it, if the election results ends up being close, we could be having another one sooner than you think. Here's how to get yourself registered for next time. To vote in a UK general election you must: You also need to be on the electoral register. You only have to register once, but will need to re-register if you have changed your address, name or nationality. The forms†can be completed online. You may need details of your national insurance number and your passport if you're a British citizen living abroad, and want to vote in England, Scotland or Wales. If you need help, you should contact your local Electoral Registration Office. You can use†this service to find the†address†if you live in England, Scotland or Wales. If you live in Northern Ireland you need to contact the†Electoral Office for Northern Ireland (EONI). He said it was 'complete nonsense'to suggest Brexit could be done by Christmas. 'All you can do by Christmas is to pass legislation to enter into negotiations. It's like the boxer saying OK, you've been training, now you can get into the ring. And you'll be in the ring with, first of all, a massively, larger economic bloc, Europe, secondly Donald Trump fighting for his life politically. I dare say he's going to start doing special deals with us. 'It's preposterous. We are in for another year of uncertainty and a possibility of a no-deal exit at the end of it. That's the reality of what we're facing if Mr Johnson gets an overall majority.'Heseltine accused the prime minister of pursuing an 'utterly disastrous'policy 'for Britain's position in the world and for our economy and for the investment which is frozen up in this country at the moment'ù. Speaking on the programme, he also said Jeremy Corbyn 'isn't fit to be prime minister. He's not going to be prime minister and you know it, I know it and every pollster reveals it.'He added: 'I think it's much more likely - the question is not whether he can be prime minister, it's whether he continues to lead the Labour party by Christmas because I think there will be a great move to get rid of him.'Michael Gove said he felt a 'certain sense of sadness'about Heseltine's views. He told the Today programme: 'On this particular question, Michael, I think, advised people to vote Liberal Democrat in the European election, so in that sense he's consistent, but I do think that he's wrong on this. 'I think that the most important thing at this general election is the choice between the two alternative prime ministers - Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn - and I think that Boris would undoubtedly ensure that we got Brexit done and avoid the dangers of two referendums, whereas Jeremy Corbyn, as we know by the words of the chief rabbi today, poses a threat to more than just our economy.'

"We now know the Boris Johnson blueprint: crisis, inequality and division",-0.75,Negative,"Nothing is what it seems in the Tory manifesto, let alone how the shameless Tory press presents it. What little there is in its few pages falls apart on cursory scrutiny. This is a Potemkin manifesto, all cardboard front, nothing behind. Note how its briefers crafted two contrary messages: fiscal prudence for the upmarkets and magnificent largesse for the downmarket papers. 'End to austerity,'trumpets the Sun, heralding 'a jumbo manifesto package of spending promises'ù. The Institute for Fiscal Studies finds just £2.9bn of new spending on public services; a minnow not a jumbo, as the Sun takes its readers for fools. Outside the NHS and schools, spending remains a colossal 15% lower than it was in 2010. Schools' uplift is still less per pupil than was spent in 2010. The NHS's increase after years of unprecedented starvation is still less than its historic average. This is not an end to penury in most services - the shut magistrates courts, abolished legal aid, probation mayhem, lost Sure Start centres, or local authorities teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. The national insurance saving of £85 a year is an insult to those who have lost £12bn in benefits. A rise of 1.1% in spending as a proportion of GDP sounds big only because it rises from such a low. The Daily Express headlines 'Boris pledges 50,000 extra nurses'ù, though the Express knows as well as the Guardian that the claim fell apart as a bare-faced cheat on Sunday. Of those, 18,500 were spuriously added as to be 'retained'ù. How? With more than 4 million waiting for operations and A&E queues longer than ever, NHS work grows more stressful. Recently I sat with a chief executive, hearing from a senior nurse in his chemotherapy ward as she gave in her notice. She couldn't take it any longer, after multiple calls at night at home from her understaffed ward with no one senior enough to deputise. She was exhausted. He begged her to stay, offered her all kinds of things, but she was burnt out and it was too hard on her young children; she was near tears as she still loved the job. A service so short of staff risks this downward spiral. Boris Johnson will not 'retain'them but he brazens it out, repeating the same untruths in every speech - the bogus 40 new hospitals or the 5m extra GP appointments. The £250m for school holiday care emerges as just £1 per primary-age child per week. His social care ruse is a sham 'cast-iron guarantee'that 'no social care user would have to sell their home'ù. But how? His £1bn is the barest emergency handout for a collapsing service. Claiming he wants 'a cross-party consensus'ù, he must hope memories are short. Before the 2010 election, the Lib Dem Norman Lamb brought together a cross-party group with the Tory Andrew Lansley and Labour's health secretary, Andy Burnham, to agree how to pay for care. The cost should fall on older people who have assets, not young families who don't own homes. They agreed on broad principles. Burnham devised a good plan for those with assets to pay a lump sum into a fund on retirement, with all care free thereafter. But pre-election, David Cameron ordered his team out and launched a 'death tax'attack to kill Burnham's plan. No wonder Labour retaliated in 2017 against Theresa May's plan, destroying it as a 'dementia tax'ù. Calling for 'cross-party consensus'on a dynamite topic is just a way to dodge responsibility. If Johnson gets a majority, it's for him to take unpopular decisions. But of all these fictions, the great woolly mammoth of untruth is that Johnson will 'get Brexit done'ù. Here's Monday's Daily Express: 'Britain can roar ahead like a lion released from a cage.'Brexit so far has done nothing but harm: the UK has plunged to the bottom of the G7 for growth, sterling has been devalued by 10% against the euro, companies have fled, research projects have been lost, and brains drained - and we haven't left yet. Johnson promises a 'fantastic'trade deal in a year: yes, a fantasy. The Financial Times says the idea that he would be 'liberated to tackle social issues festering since 2016 is palpably false'ù. Worse than that, he has no plans to liberate. Or none that dare speak their name in public. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has it right: as a blueprint for five years, 'the lack of significant policy action is remarkable'ù. No vision, and no burning wish to repair anything, nor to fire anything up. That void will be filled by the Brexit wishlist, to slash regulation and abolish workers' rights, with that ominous manifesto threat to 'update the Human Rights Act'and judicial review to 'ensure there is a proper balance'ù. That means exit from the European convention on human rights, and exit from civilisation. The BBC expects no mercy, nor will his NHS 'not for sale'pledge survive first contact with a Trump trade negotiation. Nothing here suggests more than token interest in confronting the UK's problems, worsened in a decade of neglect. Brexit will consume all money and capacity, ignoring crippling inequality, gaping generational wealth divide and national educational failure. Above all, Johnson parks climate catastrophe until 2050, when it will be someone else's crisis. Labour's ambition is colossal by comparison. Too much, some say, but that's far better than none. Besides, its gargantuan menu of a manifesto will be picked from a la carte, since other pollsters agree with John Curtice that Corbyn has zero chance of winning a majority. But there is every chance he can deny Johnson a majority: if the Tory lead can be cut from its average 12% to 6% or 7%, then Johnson loses. Instead we get a progressive alliance, which would choose its priorities together. '¢ Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist ",0,Neutral
"Once, politicians treated voters as adults. Now they are contemptuous",-0.625,Negative,"Two men go head to head in a TV debate. They wrestle with Britain's relationship to Europe, the meaning of sovereignty, the nature of global influence, the question of job losses. They listen carefully to each other and respond to the other's points, fierce in defence of their arguments, but reasonable towards their opponent. It's an illuminating discussion that makes one appreciate the issues more deeply. No, not last week's TV spat between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn (as if!) but an hour-long debate on BBC's Panorama more than 40 years ago between Tony Benn and Roy Jenkins in the run-up to the 1975 referendum on Britain's membership of the Common Market. Both were cabinet ministers in Harold Wilson's government, Jenkins an ardent supporter of membership, Benn a passionate opponent. What is striking about the debate is that it could have taken place last week - the issues at the heart of the Europe question have changed little over that time. What is striking, too, is that the 40-year-old encounter is more illuminating, on both sides, than most discussions we have had since 2016. Comparing the old Benn-Jenkins tussle with current political debates shows not just how shallow and vapid politics has become, but also how politicians' expectations of the electorate have been transformed. Benn and Jenkins took their audience seriously and so considered their arguments, and those of their opponent, with care. Today, political debates have become vacuous and insipid because politicians have become contemptuous of the electorate. Voters, many believe, are ignorant, swayed more by emotion than by reason, happy to accept lies and drawn to politicians with easy answers. So politicians prefer slogans to reasoned argument, dismiss scrutiny as 'partisanship'and treat truth as if it were a form of entertainment. It's an approach rooted in a caricature of the electorate. It's also one shaped by a shift in the relationship between working-class voters, education and politics. In his magnificent book The Intellectual Life of the British Working Classes, Jonathan Rose traces the struggles of working people to educate themselves, from early autodidactism through education reform to the Workers' Educational Association and the Open University. Drawing on memoirs, diaries, oral history and social surveys, Rose provides 'an intellectual history of people who were not expected to think for themselves'ù. The miners' institutes of south Wales, funded initially by a levy on wages, became 'one of the greatest networks of cultural institutions created by working people anywhere in the world'ù. By 1934, there were more than 100 miners' libraries in the Welsh coalfield with an average stock of 3,000 books. Another triumph of the autodidact tradition was the Everyman's Library, launched in 1906 by J'âM Dent, the 10th child of a Darlington house-painter, who left school aged 13, became a bookbinder and eventually a publisher, whose dream had always been to ensure that 'for a few shillings the reader may have a whole bookshelf of the immortals'ù. Everyman's Library did not publish just obvious works that might appeal, such as Dickens or Shakespeare, but such 'lengthy and intimidating'works as George Grote's 12-volume History of Greece and six volumes of Ibsen, all of which found a ready audience. Such reading provided not just cultural ballast but political hope, too, revealing the possibility of new worlds, and expanding horizons that might have been limited by the factory or the mine. 'The Labour movement,'a Coventry millworker observed, 'grew out of mutual improvement societies.'It was a tradition sustained by communities that helped cultivate dignity, organisations that nurtured the spirit of self-improvement, collective struggles that enlarged the range of the possible. Much of that has disappeared. The dislocation of working-class communities, the destruction of Labour movement organisations and the expunging of trade union struggles have all unstitched the relationship between knowledge and political change. Education today, as the political scientist David Runciman has observed, 'sorts us according to where we feel we belong'ù. As western societies have become more technocratic, 'empowering a new class of experts, for whom education is a prerequisite of entry into the elite'- bankers, lawyers, doctors, civil servants, pundits, academics - so knowledge no longer seems to 'speak for itself'but 'for the world view of the people who possess it'ù. Knowledge, instead, becomes a marker of the place one possesses in society. This has led one side to deride 'experts'ù, the other to view the electorate as ignorant and incapable of deep reasoning. That a 40-year-old debate is more clarifying about Brexit than one held last week reveals the degree to which politics has become hollowed out. We should take care that the contempt shown to the electorate does not become a self-fulfilling prophecy. '¢ Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist ",0,Neutral
"In his deceit and cynicism, Michael Gove is the embodiment of the age",-0.75,Negative,"How can I encapsulate the decline of the west? Libraries of books have been written on populism. Learned men and women have agonised over the eagerness to believe lies are true and the truth an elitist conspiracy. Surely a paltry newspaper column cannot begin to compete. Fortunately for journalists, if not for this luckless country, self-harming mendacity, institutionalised deceit and manufactured paranoia can be condensed down to the pimple-shaped figure of Michael Gove. To further his career, he has made a nonsense of the ideas he pretends to believe in, and projects the vices he cannot admit to possessing on to those who challenge him. Writing of the pornographic tradition in western art, John Berger described the projection of artists who 'painted a naked woman because you enjoyed looking at her, put a mirror in her hand and you called the painting Vanity, thus morally condemning the woman whose nakedness you had depicted for your own pleasure'ù.  The pornographic tradition in western politics is no different. The dirty trickster accuses his critics of practising the dirty tricks he so enjoys and thus justifies pulling more tricks to counter them. In an interview with Channel 4 News, the reporter asked straight questions about the fake fact-checking account Gove's Conservative party had set up, the propaganda from Gove's Vote Leave that the EU was preparing to ban kettles, Gove's willingness to condemn Boris Johnson as unfit to be prime minister in 2016 and serve under him in 2019, and his declaration that Leavers 'didn't vote to leave without a deal'he duly contradicted with a later threat to take Britain out without a deal. You are making a 'polemical leftwing case'ù, cried the man who can only make a rightwing case. How do I know you haven't rigged your computer to show me fake news? asked the man whose party had just rigged a fake news feed. The mere act of asking questions became evidence of a disabling bias. The political usefulness of Gove's self-justification was as striking as his absence of self-knowledge. It allowed the Conservatives to use any tactic to fight such unscrupulous media opponents. For, and here we come to the central assumption of modern political discourse, Gove believed no one except the corrupted advocate of malign interests would question him. 'What are we supposed to do?'asked Channel 4's Ciaran Jenkins, if we cannot question you on your own statements. Well, Ciaran, you're meant to be a good boy and suck it up was Gove's implicit reply. Unlike the other architects of Brexit, Gove gets an easy ride. He affects a courteous manner. He reads books, and may even have finished a couple, and perhaps that's why critics back away. His answer to the question why the public should trust him after his many deceits is that as education secretary in the Cameron government he had promised to raise educational standards and as a result 1.9 million children went to good or outstanding schools. Yet history will remember Michael Gove, assuming it remembers him at all, for his Trump-era defining statement: 'I think the people of this country have had enough of experts.'He disparaged the results of a good or outstanding education for the same reason he disparages the hard questions of an open society: education, expertise, a free press must be disparaged if they pose the tiniest threat to the fatuous nationalist adventure he and his comrades have manacled their party and country to. It's not just the projection of his own manipulativeness on to others: Gove's internal contradictions would keep a halfway competent shrink in work for years. The man who promotes education raises the mob against the educated. The national security conservative, who in his time was a neocon who fretted about the decline of the west, is now a clear and present danger to the nation's security in ways that are worth taking a moment to understand. You can see why Gove and Johnson are so keen to sell the line that they will 'get Brexit done'and 'take back control'in a matter of months. They must pretend it will be easy to take the UK out of the EU in January and then negotiate a trade deal with Brussels by the end of 2020. While we wait for the negotiations to end, Britain will be subject to EU rules, pay the EU money and accept the free movement of EU citizens to Britain and vice versa. It will seem as if there is no point in leaving. The Conservatives could get over this embarrassment by striking a quick deal if they promise to abide by EU regulations on workers' rights, the environment and trade standards, and allow EU fishing fleets to carry on as before. But they say they won't because, once again, what would be the point of Brexit? A hard-fought deal will take years to negotiate, during which we will be subject to EU rules, free movement and budgetary demands. You get the point. There is no point and the electorate cannot realise that before 12 December. Britain's sole diplomatic advantage is that it is a European military power. It can use the continent's security as a negotiating card. Don't think Gove's previous belief in national defence would restrain him. Brexit furthers Russian foreign policy objectives by weakening Britain and Europe, which is why, I suspect, the government has suppressed the report into Russian influence in the referendum. Do not imagine the supposedly patriotic Gove sees that contradiction either. If he tried to resolve his contradictions, he would fall apart. Fair-minded readers will say that a description of Gove's deceitful manoeuvres applies as well to Corbyn's politics, Trump's politics, Orb√°n's politics and Bolsonaro's politics. Why pick on this little guy? My reply is that Gove's redeeming virtue is that he is a one-stop shop, where you can find all that is tricky and tacky 24/7 in one convenient store.

Understanding Englishness and the national identity crisis,0,Neutral,"Alex Niven ('òEnglishness' was never enough to build a nation on, Journal, 20 November) makes the reasonable point that English identity as it now exists is unlikely to become the single unifying national identity of England. Britishness faces the same problem. But like too many on the left, his desire to dismiss the English prevents him from asking who they are and what they want. While there is not a single monolithic Englishness, those who emphasise their English identity, and who were more likely to vote leave, do not, by and large, share Boris Johnson's Anglocentric British nationalism. They are, very largely, not the people in power in England, whether in corporate business, the media, politics or academia. They are more likely to live in places that have been on the losing side of social, economic and political change for 30 years, outside the liberal cultures of the metropolitan city centres. To be English is, for many at least, not wanting to be ignored any longer, to want to be heard or - to coin a phrase - to 'take back control'ù. There is no successful future for England, or the union, that does not involve bringing the English back into the national conversation. Denying they exist or slamming the door in their face is not a good way to start.Prof John DenhamCentre for English Identity and Politics, University of Southampton '¢ I heartily agree with Alex Niven that 'building up the English regions'is a much more practical solution to the current identity crisis of the UK than 'the quest for an artificial, unitary Englishness'ù. Who can honestly say that they identify with a region stretching from Land's End to Berwick, defined largely by geography, and encompassing such huge disparities in wealth and opportunity on the way? Perhaps it is time for someone to come up with new, 'neutral'names for the various parts of England, independent of past affiliations and rivalries, as was done during the major upheaval in local government in the 1970s, and to consign the name 'England'to the waste bin of history.Jim GrozierBrighton, East Sussex '¢ Alex Niven suggests that there should be a revival of the movement for regional devolution, following the campaign to defeat the yes vote in the 2004 north-east England devolution referendum.

Johnson's Brexit would devastate business - the CBI must be hoping that he's lying,0,Neutral,"Why would anyone in business vote for Boris Johnson? His pretend courting of the CBI and others is another of his one-night stands. Just now, what he needs are the votes of 'Labour leavers'ù, not capitalist remainers. So at the CBI conference on Monday he fobbed off the latter with Johnsonian lies. The biggest whopper is that a vote for him would 'end uncertainty over Brexit'ù. It will not, it will prolong it. As long as Johnson pledges to withdraw Britain from Europe's customs union and single market, the current commercial uncertainty will continue. Serious trade talks do not begin until next year, when according to Johnson either the UK will default to WTO tariffs or a new deal must be sought with the EU. The latter will be on EU terms, of long duration and infinite complexity. Uncertainty will be total. Meanwhile, Johnson's only specific promise is that business's free access to Europe's fluid labour market will end. In its place is proposed a towering bureaucratic edifice of border controls, quotas, points systems and hostility; as already outlined by his anti-immigration home secretary, Priti Patel. No migrant will be allowed into Britain without already having a government-approved job. This is not a market at all. To employers in construction, welfare and hospitality it will be devastating. Some will lose a quarter of their labour overnight. Alongside these structural shifts away from a free market, Johnson talks of 'setting business free''to trade with the rest of the world. This is garbage, and he knows it. There are no trade deals, other than trivial ones, with the rest of the world waiting in the wings, let alone that remotely compensate for lost European trade. Farming and fishing alone will be crippled. As for the Brexit thesis that deals with China or the US would see Britain 'rule-making'rather than rule-taking - it is simply a lie. Johnson's business case for leaving Europe's economic area is a xenophobic fantasy - and one that the CBI should demolish relentlessly. No one, not even Brexiters, can pretend it will boost the economy in the foreseeable future. Johnson's spending spree - which is on the scale of that of a banana republic - may stave off trouble in the short term. But how it can be reconciled with the Tories' reputation for economic rectitude is a mystery. Business must join the rest of the country in hoping that Johnson's promises are indeed those of a one-night stand. They will not see the light of the morning after. The hope must be that, if Johnson gets Brexit, he will not after all leave Europe's economic area or its open markets. He will remain within the UK's biggest trading partnership. He will rediscover his hero Margaret Thatcher's faith in market economics. To this has British politics been reduced - that it must now pray for mendacity.

Boris Johnson is deluded if he thinks he can 'òget Brexit done' in a hurry,0,Neutral,"Get Brexit done.'The phrase certainly has a powerful ring to it. More than that, it fulfils two obvious electoral purposes. It avoids political discussion of what 'doing Brexit'might actually involve. And, more practically, it provides a phrase that can be memorised and repeated ad nauseum on rainy doorsteps and in online advertisements. After three years of Brexit debate, as the UK has tried and failed to leave the European Union, why wouldn't it strike a chord? What, then, is the problem? The simple answer is that it's profoundly misleading. Let's assume - and it's quite an assumption - that things go smoothly for the government. Boris Johnson's electoral gamble pays off. He comes back on 13 December at the head of a majority government. At that point, he may still struggle to 'bang Brexit through'by Christmas because parliament resumes sitting only on 17 December, and then there is the small matter of swearing in 650 MPs, and a Queen's speech and subsequent debate. However, with a majority, he should be able to pass his withdrawal agreement bill in order that the UK finally leaves the European Union on 31 January. So far, so simple. Yet Brexit will at this point be far from 'done'ù. Exit will represent the end of stage one, the point at which the United Kingdom ceases to be a member state of the European Union. It then goes into an 11-month holding pattern known as transition, which expires on 31 December 2020. And now for some semantics. This government and its predecessor have insisted on using the phrase 'implementation period'to describe transition and that is the wording which appears in the bill. The reference to implementation is, to say the least, profoundly misleading. Why? Because we have absolutely nothing to implement. Instead, this period will be used for trying to sort out the future relationship between the UK and the EU. Researchers at the Institute for Government have provided a good guide as to how long these negotiations typically take (about four years). To summarise, when you look at recent free-trade agreements signed by the European Union, it becomes clear that an 11-month transition period is simply too short to allow for negotiation. It is true that the time it takes to negotiate a deal will hinge on what kind of deal the parties want. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, has accepted that a 'basic free-trade deal'could possibly be negotiated by the end of next year. Yet this raises numerous questions. For one thing, a basic deal on tariffs would risk falling foul of EU member states worried about the danger of Britain having tariff-free access to the EU market but able to cut standards, including workers' rights. For another, the government has repeatedly claimed it is seeking a 'best-in-class'trade deal. One can only wonder what kind of class it has in mind. And the UK has a major interest in a much broader trade deal, covering services and internal security matters, such as access to EU databases, which have proved essential for combatting international crime. All of this points to the UK wanting a much more substantial and wider-ranging trade deal than the basic model. And this will take time - maybe years. This brings us back to the reality that 11 months of transition will simply not be enough. Which means asking for an extension. The withdrawal agreement allows for this: it provides that the joint committee of UK and EU representatives 'may, before 1 July 2020, adopt a single decision extending the transition period for up to one or two years'ù. Johnson has said that he will not ask for an extension to the transition period, and so many fear a new cliff edge or no-deal Brexit on 1 January 2021, as the UK leaves the transition period without a (comprehensive) trade deal. The prime minister laughs this off. The UK, he argues, is in a unique situation: it starts from a position of alignment with EU rules. But this is a red herring. Never before has a state negotiated a (less than) free-trade deal distancing itself from a major trading partner. And the EU will wish to scrutinise very carefully what dealignment actually means in practice. Clause by clause, chapter by chapter, the negotiations will be painstaking and time consuming. The divorce will be achieved, but the new relationship will be in limbo. And let's think about that new deal. Unlike during the article 50 period, each of the EU's member states will be intimately involved, and, assuming the deal sought is an ambitious one, it is conceivable each will enjoy a veto. Expect, then, each national capital to come up with its own list of desiderata that it wants included in any future deal. And add to the fact that, because this is a deal intended to make trade harder rather than easier, we will be dealing solely with losses. In a normal trade negotiation, there are 'wins'with which to offset concessions. Not so here. So ratification might be expected to be particularly tough. So the choice is relatively clear. Either a lengthy, and potentially rancourous, process that will belie the idea of 'getting Brexit done'ù. Or a short, sharp negotiation ending with a short, thin agreement that raises the prospect of years of adjustment as the UK economy adapts to a far looser relationship with its largest and nearest trading partner. No one should think it's going to be all over anytime soon. '¢ Anand Menon is director of the UK in a Changing Europe and professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King's College London.

"Vote for candidates who care about climate, urge Scottish Greens",0,Neutral,"Green voters should only back election candidates who accept that urgent action on climate is needed, the leader of the Scottish Green party has said. Patrick Harvie, the party's co-convenor, said green voters should prioritise radical action on climate, giving that equal or greater weight than Brexit or Scottish independence, by politely 'rattling the cages'of their local candidates. 'We cannot afford for this to be an election where climate is seen somewhere way down the list of priorities,'he told the Guardian. 'We need to demand climate action. The way to do that is to vote Green and, if you don't have a Green candidate, demand that climate action from others.'The next UK government was likely to be in power for five years, half the 10-year period in which climate scientists argue that urgent action is needed to prevent runaway climate change, he said. Yet no mainstream party had a sufficiently radical or ambitious strategy on climate. 'Hold them to account for what they have said, about fossil fuel subsidies, tax breaks for the oil and gas industry, aviation expansion whether at Heathrow or anywhere else,'he said. 'Are they a candidate willing to challenge their own party to move further, faster and more radically on this agenda?'It was wrong, for those reasons, for broadcasters to ignore Green leaders in televised election debates, he said. 'I don't think the world can afford for the next five years a government that has been elected without any debate on climate change,'he said. Harvie's party, which has six MSPs at Holyrood - one more than the Liberal Democrats - is standing 22 candidates at the general election, chiefly in seats across the most populated areas of the central belt. The Scottish Greens won 8.2% of the vote in May's European election, with nearly 130,000 votes, but are polling at about 4% for the general election. They have little chance of winning a Commons seat but have not followed the Greens in England and Wales, which is a separate party, by standing aside in key seats to improve the chances of other anti-Tory or pro-remain candidates defeating the Tories.

The Lib Dems prioritise stopping Brexit but oppose independence. The SNP wants to stop Brexit but is now prioritising independence, while Labour wants a new Brexit deal and a second EU referendum, while also halting the Tories. 'There's no single tactical strategy that achieves all of these things [in Scotland],'he said. 'If people are minded to think tactically, it's going to be a local decision. And it shouldn't be one that is forced upon them by political parties.'The Scottish Greens have been accused of helping the SNP, their allies in the independence movement, after its local branches chose not to stand candidates in two of Scotland's most marginal seats which the SNP is at risk of losing - Perth and North Perthshire, and North East Fife. Harvie denied that - delegates at his party's annual conference voted unanimously against any coalitions or pacts, he said. He said relations with the SNP had soured significantly after he attacked the Scottish government's climate strategy for being too weak. Green candidates were needed wherever possible 'so the energy and excitement that's come into the climate movement in recent years gets some political expression'ù, he said. 'Even if I accept that we have a way to go before sweeping the board at a Westminster election. you're not going to make progress by not taking part.

Gove 'lying' about EU citizens' NHS rights to gain votes,0.125,Positive,"Michael Gove has been accused of deliberately 'lying'to the public about EU citizens' rights to access to the NHS as a cynical ploy to win votes in Labour leave marginals. Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, wrote in the Mail on Sunday that it was 'unfair'that EU citizens had 'preferential access to free NHS care '¶ without paying in'ù. His opponents said this creates an impression of 'spongeing, bed blocking EU citizens'ù. The Labour MEP Claude Moraes said he feared the Conservative party was reverting to 1980s 'dog whistle'anti-immigrant campaigning to score political points. EU citizens who are not students have access to the NHS only because they pay tax. Nicolas Hatton, the co-founder of the3million, which campaigns for EU citizens rights, said Gove's remarks were 'disgusting'and 'complete misrepresentation of the facts'ù. 'It's a cheap political ploy based on xenophobia designed to get votes. 'EU citizens do not have automatic rights to health systems in EU states. In the first three months, you are treated like a tourist with no rights, and after three months, unless you are are working or are self-sufficient, then you have no rights to the NHS,'said Hatton. EU free movement rules are designed to enable easy movement of workers around the bloc and reciprocal health arrangements have enabled around 1.2m British nationals to settle in the EU with access to national healthcare. Moraes said: 'Gove is lying and I think they are going to continue lying for the campaign. The line that Gove used about 'òpaying into' the NHS is really an old-style racist trope and is designed to target Labour marginals where the vote is about leave or remain. 'You can't pay into the NHS even if you wanted to. Michael Gove knows only too well that free movement is the new immigration and if you can conflate the two and throw in something about Aussie-style points system, you are saying to voters: 'òWe will control EU migration, all the millions of 'EU wasters'ù. We're blocking them and the only brown and black people who come in will be heart surgeons or tech people.' That's the psychology of this, and it's lethal.' The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, accused Gove of deliberately 'bashing and blaming migrants'while the migration historian Tanja Bueltmann called it 'dog-whistling'ù. Dog-whistling once this week wasn't enough for Michael Gove, he's done it again. Like the first time, all of it a lie as the Govt's own report shows without question. Undoubtedly, it's no coincidence either that Gove chose two Eastern European nationalities for singling out. https://t.co/ZdhPT8OodI pic.twitter.com/rQ34GSH5Y6 In his article in the Mail on Sunday, Gove said: 'It's unfair that people coming from European countries can access free NHS care without paying in while others make significant contributions '¶ It's not right that people from Bulgaria and Slovenia can come here without any controls and have automatic rights that people from Bangladesh and Singapore do not.'Abbott said in a tweet: 'Michael Gove is completely wrong to say people from EU are accessing the NHS without 'òpaying in'.'Michael Gove is completely wrong to say people from EU are accessing the NHS without 'paying in'.† EU workers pay taxes. The NHS is not a contributory system. This is how it begins - the Tory project to undermine the NHS, by bashing and blaming migrants first. Moraes decried the emerging Tory narrative as a return to 1980s anti-immigration rhetoric. 'What the Tories want to do is create the idea that there are big groups of people blocking public services for indigenous people,'he said. 'The people they are targeting are people who don't generally go to the EU to work and won't be benefiting from the reciprocal nature of free movement. The free movement arguments don't apply to them.'Moraes said this cohort did not talk about free movement in focus groups, but did talk about immigration, and if the Conservative party could conflate the two it could gain political capital. 'When the Labour party manifesto is published on Thursday and Jeremy Corbyn explains he doesn't mean unfettered access, that argument will struggle to be heard in Tory target Labour marginals where is all about leave and remain,'he added. Sources close to Gove say his comments were referring to proposals to extend the £400-a-year NHS surcharge paid by non-EU citizens to nationals from the EU who arrive after Brexit. Gove's remarks came as Boris Johnson announced a range of border control proposals including a five-year wait for access to social benefits for all immigrants including those from the EU; the ending of child benefit being sent abroad, a practice it says will save £800m a year; and an increase to the annual health surcharge for all post-Brexit immigrants, including those from the EU, to £625.

Len McCluskey should see the value of free movement,0.25,Positive,"It is depressing to see Len McCluskey regurgitating the false notion that free movement across Europe has ushered in a regime of cheap labour and the undercutting of wages (Backlash as union chief calls for Labour to curb free movement, 14 November).  This is factually incorrect as consistently demonstrated by researchers such as Jonathan Portes, and deeply insulting to all those European workers who have been contributing massively to our society - doctors, nurses, teachers, university researchers, social care staff, drivers, workers in the food, hospitality and building industries - people who have been paying more in taxes than they receive in benefits, hence contributing to the economy and in fact creating jobs and growth. I cannot believe that all the staff at McCluskey's disposal have not informed him of the objective facts about the impact of free movement. Hence his intervention is a wilful distortion of the situation, pandering to anti-immigrant ideology going back generations. The Labour party's manifesto team must honour the excellent conference motion on free movement and not give in to McCluskey's retrogade, populist rhetoric.Gideon Ben-TovimEmeritus reader in sociology, University of Liverpool '¢ Any Labour supporter drawing too simple a pragmatic message from Len McCluskey's remarks on immigration policy, conceding ground to working-class 'commonsense concerns'over migrants, should reflect on the recent experience of other European social-democratic parties following this path. Denmark's Social Democrats' move to rightwing anti-immigration policies helped them win the 2019 parliamentary elections, but at the expense of cementing Islamophobia firmly at the heart of Danish politics, thereby assisting the rise of two new far-right national parties, boding ill for the future. Elsewhere, electoral failure has ensued instead. Slovakia's social-democratic prime minister, Robert Fico, campaigned in 2016 using anti-migrant language, promising to 'never allow a single Muslim immigrant under a quota system'ù. His party lost its majority and 40% of its parliamentary seats, while neo-Nazis gained 10% of the seats. The Czech Republic's left-of-centre president, Milos Zeman, adopted anti-immigrant policies in national elections in 2017 - the result was a dramatic surge in favour of populist anti-migrant parties and the ruling social democrats fell to 7% of the vote. Echoing anti-immigrant sentiment legitimises and emboldens populist rightwing politics.John Chowcat Hythe, Kent '¢ Len McCluskey's dispiriting intervention on Wednesday was a blast from a politically alien, but not-so-distant past. It was the 'Controls on immigration'mug all over again. Policy should be adopted because it is morally and ethically right - and argued for on that basis. It was this impulse that lay behind the election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader in the first place. Because Labour's current strategy means enthusing its base as much as its potential voters, policies must be optimistic, radical and progressive. And, as it turns out, freedom of movement is overwhelmingly popular with the general public. A recent poll showed 67% in favour of complete freedom of movement for EU and UK nationals to live and work in each others' countries.  McCluskey's resurrection of the 'traditional/white working class'- a racist dogwhistle if ever there was one - is poisonous. It is a concept that must be cast into Labour's dustbin for ever, alongside the Ed stone and that 'Controls on immigration'mug. The working class includes everyone who works for a living, whether they are born here or not. Everyone deserves protections at work, decent pay, decent hours and a say in their future. Employment rights and collective bargaining can and must be extended. Bosses and capitalists who ruthlessly exploit their workforces must be unceremoniously punished. But make no mistake: denying freedom of movement for workers, and allowing bosses to threaten them with deportation if they do not conform, will undermine this task completely.Lawrence DunnManchester  '¢ Join the debate - email guardian.letters@theguardian.com '¢ Read more Guardian letters - click here to visit gu.com/letters '¢ Do you have a photo you'd like to share with Guardian readers?

Tesla cites Brexit as Germany chosen over UK for European plant,0,Neutral,"The Tesla chief executive, Elon Musk, has said Brexit uncertainty played a role in the firm's decision to build its first European factory in Germany rather than the UK. The billionaire entrepreneur revealed that the firm's European battery plant would be built on the outskirts of Berlin. Speaking to Auto Express after making the announcement, Musk said: 'Brexit [uncertainty] made it too risky to put a Gigafactory in the UK.'The US electric carmaker also plans to locate a research and development base in the German capital. Musk announced the Berlin decision at a car industry awards ceremony on Tuesday night hosted by the German tabloid Bild. He said: 'Some of the best cars in the world are made in Germany.

"Vote Lib Dem, urges former Conservative minister David Gauke",0,Neutral,"The former Conservative justice secretary David Gauke is urging people to vote for Liberal Democrat and independent candidates at the general election to deny Boris Johnson a majority. The rebel politician, who lost the Tory whip for voting against a no-deal Brexit, announced he was standing as an independent candidate in his seat of South West Hertfordshire but said traditional Tory voters should back Lib Dem candidates in many parts of the country. He warned the public against voting for his old party because of its hard Brexit strategy and 'cooperation'with the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, which he claims means a continued risk of crashing out of the EU on no-deal terms. 'I'm impressed by Jo Swinson. I think if I was living in a lot of constituencies I would lend my vote to the Liberal Democrats,'he told Radio 4's Today programme. 'Traditional Conservative voters like me should lend their support to the Liberal Democrats but I think I am best placed to run as an independent.''I am calling for people to vote for the centre-ground.'The former chief secretary to the Treasury said getting enough Liberal Democrats and independents returned to parliament would create a parliament opposed to no deal and that would also block the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, from becoming prime minister. He said Boris Johnson and Farage had taken part in 'choreographed cooperation'on a much harder Brexit strategy. The prime minister's promises that the Brexit transition period would not extend beyond 2020 and that in that time they would devise a free trade deal with the EU would be impossible to keep, Gauke suggested. 'One simply cannot negotiate a free trade agreement in that timeframe,'he said, suggesting trade agreements could take up to six years and on average took three years. He said: 'A Conservative majority after the next general election will take us in the direction of a very hard Brexit and in all likelihood at the end of 2020 we will leave the implementation period without a deal with the EU on WTO [World Trade Organization] terms - in effect on no-deal terms - and that I believe would be disastrous for the prosperity of this country.''All sectors would become unviable. The agricultural sector, our manufacturing industries, will be in a very, very difficult position.'He said the government had boxed itself in by refusing to extend the transition period. Gauke was elected in 2005 and served in the governments of David Cameron and Theresa May. Farage said he would stand down candidates  in all 317 Tory-held seats to avoid splitting the leave vote and seeing the Lib Dems elected in vast swathes of seats, particularly in the south-west. He said he had come to the decision after Johnson released a video clip saying he would not extend the transition period beyond 2020 and would pursue a Canada-style free trade agreement, which means no political alignment with the EU.M Michael Gove, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and the minister in charge of no-deal planning, said he respected Gauke but that he was wrong to say Johnson would not be able to achieve a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2020. He said the prime minister had already proved his critics wrong by securing a withdrawal agreement with the EU that removed the backstop.  'He [Johnson] succeeded in securing that deal in defiance of the sceptics and cynics and we can secure a free trade agreement by the end of 2020,'Gove said. 'We can do so because we start in a position where we have a political declaration that spells out in some significant detail what the nature of that relationship would be.  'We've got an oven-ready Brexit deal. Ping it in the microwave, press the button and that Brexit deal can be done by 31 January,'Gove said in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said a Conservative majority would ensure Brexit and domestic issues were resolved. Asked if the threat of a no-deal Brexit was back on the table if a free trade deal could be reached by 2020, he said he felt a sense of deja vu and repeated that Johnson had already defied critics in what he had achieved on Brexit.

I'm a Liberal Democrat candidate - here's why I'm stepping aside for Labour,0.625,Positive,"Whenever I see Barry Gardiner or Mark Francois on television, I realise how much Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson have contributed to the zombification of British politics. Reason, logic and the capacity for independent thought are qualities now pretty much irreconcilable with party allegiance. In the Lib Dems there's still, I hope, a home for an individual with a conscience. What's more, ours has always been a grassroots organisation, where it's ultimately the members who call the shots, which keeps us uniquely in touch with the national psyche. In Canterbury, where I'd been chosen as our parliamentary candidate in opposition to the incumbent Labour MP, Rosie Duffield, we have what might be called a little local difficulty. In the last election, she won the traditionally Tory seat on the slimmest of margins - fewer than 200 votes - and, while I was confident I could substantially increase the Lib Dem vote on the back of my party's national resurgence, it was clear there was a danger I'd divide the remainers. That would allow in our common enemy, Anna Firth, the Tory candidate and an avowed hard Brexiter and former Vote Leave stalwart. I don't trust Corbyn on Brexit, but I share with many members of my party locally a visceral dread of the Commons being filled with people like Firth. Trying to stop that happening is now more important than ever given Nigel Farage's unholy alliance with Johnson. I've therefore asked that my local party withdraw my nomination papers to stand for Canterbury. Politics does not always have to be grubby and small-minded; sometimes it's possible to acknowledge that what's at stake is more important than party politics - and personal ambition - and we can do what's right. In this invidious situation, both standing and not standing could be interpreted as weakness. But the nightmare that kept me awake was posing awkwardly at the count beside a vanquished Duffield as the Tory Brexiter raised her hands in triumph. I wanted no part in that. My party had strained to do a deal with Labour in relation to this seat - putting my formal adoption as its candidate on hold for almost two months - but it proved not to be possible. As with so many things, Corbyn was incapable of adapting to changing times and could not see that my party was now every bit as much of a force to be reckoned with as his, if not more. In the EU elections, we not only beat Labour, but also won more seats than them and the Tories combined. I know some would wish me to trudge obliviously forward in Canterbury, but that seemed to be something only a zombie would do. We have to take full responsibility for our decisions and we cannot have them made for us. I wish Duffield well and urge her to fight for our country; and, when she hopefully gets to resume her seat in the Commons, to continue to think for herself.

Sam Gyimah continues down Lib Dem path of fairytales and unicorns,0,Neutral,"It wasn't the worst day to campaign on adult education. Almost at the very moment that Sam Gyimah, the Lib Dems' business spokesperson, was sitting down to chat to a handful of apprentices in Marylebone after a near pointless two-mile journey in the party's electric battle bus, Nigel Farage was busy handing out P45s to 317 of the Brexit party's own candidates in Hartlepool. Still, as they had all stumped up a non-refundable £100 for the privilege, the party was over £30K to the good. And Nige had kept Boris Johnson and Arron Banks happy. You win some, you win some. It wasn't the most challenging outing for Gyimah. All the apprentices were either too friendly, too young to remember or just not that bothered about university tuition fees - which was was probably just as well. He too has the wide-eyed innocence of the ingenue. But then he has been on something of a reskilling programme himself, having defected from the Conservatives only a few months ago. Gyimah has had to go back to basics. Starting with his CV. Which some might call wishful thinking. Others might be less polite. He may be in with a decent shout of winning Kensington - he's immensely likeable and being neither a leaver nor a Corbynista is a distinct advantage in that part of London - but listening to him speak you could be forgiven for thinking that the Lib Dems and the Tories were almost identical before Theresa May resigned. His insistence he has always remained true to himself and that it was the Conservative party that changed - it's not me, it's you - is not altogether convincing. After all, the Lib Dems haven't exactly altered their position on Brexit or anything much else in the past five years, so if he's always been so in tune with the party, you can't immediately see why he didn't switch over long ago. But better one sinner that repenteth and all that, I suppose. You also can't help feeling Gyimah could do with a little help with his interview technique. Come on, I say conspiratorially, trying to out-charm the arch charmer. I know and you know that Jo Swinson doesn't have a prayer of becoming the prime minister so her going around saying that she does makes her sound a bit ridiculous.  If the Lib Dems are serious about stopping Brexit, then they are going to have to come to some sort of deal with Labour. But Gyimah just smiles and shakes his head. The Lib Dems are going to win the election and Swinson will be prime minister. The plan A is to have no plan B. There is no plan B because plan A is going to work. It is written in the stars. It is also quite mad. Gyimah tries to get me back on topic. He is here to plug the Lib Dems' 'skills wallet'ù, a £10K handout that everyone will be able to use at different points in their lives to retrain. That sounds like a great idea. So how would he spend his £10K if he doesn't get elected to parliament? What has he always fancied doing if he wasn't an MP? With his trademark pastel chinos, I could see him getting a lot of work as a Boden model. Or failing that, then definitely Country Casuals. 'Ah,'he says, slightly startled. 'That's a very good question.'But one he isn't willing to answer. Because he's definitely, definitely going to be re-elected. Fair enough, but even if you do then how about spending some of that money anyway on a course for MPs to make sure they don't end up in the wrong party a second time? Still no. OK, then. So if you don't want to claim your £10K, then can I have it instead? Politics has become such a drug-fuelled fantasy, sketchwriting has become almost redundant. I could retrain as a stenographer instead. 'I don't think that's how it works,'Gyimah says, beetling towards the exit. Things to do, voters to win over. Shame. The skills wallet is definitely one of the more sensible ideas to have been proposed this election. Just think of all those Brexit party candidates and supporters who believed Farage last week when he said that Boris Johnson's deal wasn't Brexit.

Farage's Brexit move means a pact among progressives is now urgent,0,Neutral,"Nigel Farage has set his stamp on this election: his astute action, standing down 317 Brexit party candidates (one in every seat that voted Conservative in the last election), confirms the brutal binary choice between the newly merged Tory-Brexit friends-of-Trump party and a flaky progressive remain alliance. The old Conservative party is no more, morphing into the Brexit party, its moderates having fled. Here's the vital question: will the fragmented progressives resolve their differences in an equally ruthless pursuit of power? They only have until Thursday to set aside petty tribal differences and block Britain leaving the European Union in January, with no referendum, on the hardest of Brexit terms. Sadly, the answer is almost certainly no. Not enough progressive candidates will stand down - unless they are seized this week with sudden paroxysms of self-sacrifice in the cause of the greater good. The Liberal Democrat, Green and Plaid Cymru agreement not to compete in 60 seats is admirable - but that's not nearly enough. As the two main parties fracture at the top, while fraying at the bottom, each relies on dragooning reluctant voters with the threat of the hated other. Labour's obtuse refusal to stand down anywhere is a colossal stumbling block: its rule book prevents it, party chiefs say, though that rule-book is ignored whenever the ruling clique wants to impose a candidate against local wishes. (Look at the disgraceful way Sally Gimson, a fairly selected candidate in Bassetlaw, was ejected by head-office diktat in order to impose one of its own.) If they were brave, honourable Labour candidates in unwinnable seats could 'forget'to submit nomination papers this Thursday if another party stands a better chance of keeping a Tory out. Not in a month of Sundays. However, it's good to see some sensible Labour candidates avoiding campaigning in key Lib Dem seats. This weekend I joined a mass Labour canvass in Crawley, members swarming into Langley Green shopping parade from surrounding no-hoper Sussex seats. Crawley should be a natural Labour homeland, theirs until 2010, missed last time by 2,457 votes. But deeper than that, as its candidate Peter Lamb reminded his visiting troops, this classic post-1945 Attlee new town owes its tree-lined spaciousness to the lost spirit of that great council-housebuilding era. Five carloads came from Lewes alone - a good sign, as the delegation was led by Mark Perryman, editor of a just-published collection of pro-Corbynist essays - who are tactically campaigning in Labour's Sussex target seats, Crawley, Hastings, East Worthing, where Labour can win. It was not always thus. Lewes used to be Lib Dem, the only hold-out in Tory East Sussex outside of Brighton, when Labour voters threw the Lib Dems their votes. But as elsewhere, outraged by Lib Dem collaboration in the austerity coalition, in 2015 they refused. Norman Baker lost the seat and his party failed again in 2017 to Maria Caulfield, an ERG-leaning fierce Brexiter who supports tougher abortion laws. This time Labour people look set to back the Lib Dem candidate, Oli Henman, to overturn a 5,508 majority. Farage withdrawing his Lewes candidate yesterday may have made that harder, but the real local spoiler is the Greens, whose candidate Johnny Denis will not stand aside. 'We're not a disposable party,'he says. 'We're always seen as the party that stands down, when Labour never does. I was the one who stood down last time and we got nothing for it.'In normal times that might not be unreasonable, as Greens have done well on Lewes council, and standing down shrinks their national vote. But the overwhelming local reckoning is that the Lib Dems are far better at winning over soft-Tory remain votes in the surrounding towns and villages. What, I ask Denis, will he feel if the Tory Brexiter wins this seat because of the split progressive vote? 'I'd be disappointed, but in the bigger picture I don't think it will make a difference as the Tories won't get a majority.'That's the way it is in too many seats, all over the country (though the Greens have stepped aside in Chingford, to help the Labour candidate's attempt to unseat Iain Duncan Smith). Of course people in Lewes should be free to vote Green or Labour, and standing down takes away democratic choice. But the real choice-killer is an electoral system that forces wise progressives to cast a nose peg vote for whichever local remainer has the best chance. The refusal of Labour and many other politicians to stand aside looks even worse after Farage's move today to boost Boris Johnson. Persuading at least 30% of voters nationally to vote tactically is an uphill task, made harder by three competing tactical vote sites that differ on a few seats. However, in a week or two a more reliable analysis of those contested constituencies is due. The best hope is that this could be the last ever election fought on the abominable first-past-the-post system: if the Tory-Brexit party fails to win, any alliance of the rest could lead to a proportional system. The Lib Dems, scarred by their coalition agreement with the Tories, won't be so dumb as to settle for anything less this time. The great majority of Labour members, including John McDonnell and Keir Starmer, strongly back reform. Out in Crawley, in these early skirmishes - before voters are focusing and before manifestos crystalise cut-through messages - door-knocking tells you as little as the variable polls. You can cherry-pick the occasional 'Yes, definitely, always Labour'or the 'No, don't like your leader'comments, along with randomly eccentric replies, though it's worth noting how Brexit gets no spontaneous mention. Reminded what austerity has done here - the lost children's centres, threadbare NHS and benefit hardships - people do respond. But don't believe anyone who claims to know which way the wind is blowing. '¢ Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist '¢ This article was amended on 12 November 2019.

The Guardian view on the Brexit party offer: one the Tories cannot refuse,0,Neutral,"Nigel Farage has never won a seat in the UK parliament, nor has he sat at a cabinet table. Yet he has been one of the most effective British politicians of recent history. On Monday he made an announcement that showed why he cannot be discounted from exerting influence just because he cannot get elected. Mr Farage's decision to pull his Brexit party candidates out of the 317 seats won by the Conservatives at the 2017 general election will help the hardliners in Boris Johnson's party. Whether this is a formal pact or just a loose arrangement, it signals to liberal Conservatives, who blanch at Mr Farage's demagoguery, that they are a vanishing species in the Tory party. Any form of Brexit that is acceptable to Mr Farage will be deeply damaging for the UK. In backing Mr Johnson's deal, Mr Farage reveals it for what it really is: a nationalist project that sacrifices economic, constitutional and social stability on the altar of cut-throat competition and deregulation. Both Mr Johnson and Mr Farage are committed to supporting a damaging Brexit to get Britain out of the EU. It's no surprise that Donald Trump has been urging both leaders to come together. To form a Johnson-led government will require the support of voters who will suffer the most from a hard Brexit. That is why Mr Farage peddles the idea that he is speaking up for the working-class leavers Labour has forgotten. Yet Conservatives will not give Mr Farage's party a free run at northern seats where there's a big leave vote, but an even bigger resistance to backing the Tories. Mr Farage, who owns 60% of the Brexit party, has described it as a 'company'rather than a political party. It 'won'the European elections this year but its candidates did not stand on any manifesto. There appears little intra-party democracy and Mr Farage is not troubled by local associations or a national executive committee. He is laying the ground for the emergence of a form of populism in the UK in which demagogues use digital tools and corporate structures to direct mass movements. That is what makes him so dangerous and why he should not be let near government. Viewed through the lens of Brexit, Britain is split into two tribes - one that sees the referendum vote of 2016 as inviolable and one that does not. Mr Farage and Mr Johnson have reached an accommodation because they think the outcome of the election will be decided by which Brexit tribe can best marshal its supporters. That begs the question of why the parties that want a second referendum on Brexit, like Labour and the Greens, or those who want to cancel it altogether, such as the Liberal Democrats, cannot do the same. Again, it might not be a formal alliance, because party loyalties and pride militates against it. On the ground there may be informal anti-Conservative alliances that materialise which are not sanctioned by party leaderships. Parties can also work together against a common enemy by encouraging tactical voting by their supporters. The pollster Peter Kellner calculated that if tactical voting could be used in the same way as it was in 1997, anti-hard Brexit parties would have a substantial majority. First-past-the-post rewards the two biggest parties, making Labour and Conservatives more likely to squash competitors because they fear being upended by them. If Britain's electoral system was fairer and did not confer winner-takes-all powers to those with only minority support among voters, then electoral pacts would not be necessary. What the current political crisis is exposing, among other things, is the inadequacy of our voting system. If progressive parties take power after 12 December they ought to make fixing it a priority.

Putting fear of Corbyn's Labour in perspective,-0.875,Negative,"Jonathan Freedland is incorrect to depict our parliamentary elections as a presidential contest (Many Jews oppose Brexit, but how can we vote for Corbyn?, 9 November). Neither is he justified in assuming that Jews should be treated as a single homogeneous entity in considering which way to vote, despite his acknowledgement that views are not uniform. The accusations against Jeremy Corbyn are well known. His long history as a defender of Palestinian rights has undoubtedly involved association with people with unacceptable views about Jews. But that does not make him antisemitic and, as he has stated, a line must be drawn when opposition to Israel's government is based on antisemitic ideas or involves comparison with the Nazis. Freedland might also have mentioned Corbyn's long-term support for Jewish causes such as the commemoration of Holocaust Memorial Day, condemnation of the persecution of Jews in Iran and Yemen, and terrorist attacks against Jewish schools and synagogues, as well as support for Jewish communal institutions in the UK. Nevertheless, more must be done to reassure many in the Jewish community that their fears are taken seriously. Corbyn needs to take a clear lead in showing progress in the Labour party's internal procedures, including no tolerance for antisemitic views among prospective candidates and providing regular aggregate reports on the outcome of disciplinary processes. However, nothing justifies Freedland in invoking the spectre of the Holocaust as a deterrent to those who wish to oppose what he calls 'a hard Brexit enforced by an Islamophobe'ù, not to mention more than nine years of austerity. It is to be hoped that he will reconsider embracing this dangerous form of identity politics.Dr Anthony IsaacsLondon '¢ Whenever I read Jonathan Freedland writing about his fear of antisemitism, part of me wants to weep. My mother was a Jewish refugee who became a Quaker, so I became familiar with the Jewish practices of friends and family, as well as the open listening and acceptance of Quakers. The narratives we tell ourselves about the world, and our place in it, have a deep impact on our beliefs and actions. I have just re-read William Blake's The Angel, in which the writer loses touch with her angel because she is afraid and so she arms herself with shields and spears to protect herself. She has lost the capacity to approach the world with love. When we teach ourselves to see hatred and suspicion in every corner, we will indeed see it everywhere. When we reach out in order to understand one another, we see each other's hopes and fears, what guides and motivates us, what brings us grief and joy. However hard it may be, we all need to do this. I hear antisemitic comments with horror and I am concerned that the policies of the far right will divide people even more. I long for a government whose policies will heal those divides. I think Jeremy Corbyn is aware of that need, and I am deeply sorry that many Jews do not believe him. He does not deserve to be a focus of fear. I cannot understand why he gets the blame for every misdeed in the party. He is not perfect, any more than the rest of us, yet he stands for the fairer, greener society that we are crying out for. Please, Jonathan, believe that a kinder world is possible and help to make it happen.Ruth TodHenley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire '¢ This article by Jonathan Freedland, a man whose journalism I generally admire, has disappointed me. He wheels out the old tropes in a most un-Guardian like way. To give one example: that Jeremy Corbyn consorts with terrorists. To truly seek peace in any situation, you have to talk to both sides in any conflict. Tony Blair succeeded by talking to Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. Not to have done so would have been remiss. I am a secular Jew, all of whose Polish maternal family of origin perished in Auschwitz, and whose French paternal grandfather was picked up in Paris and died in Drancy holding camp. I too am perhaps oversensitive. To quote Freedland's words: 'I am afraid that Jewish history has made us that way, prone to imagining the worst.'Despite that, I categorically refute that either Jeremy Corbyn or the Labour party are antisemitic. They are, like me, against the government and spirit of Netanyahu, and its imperialist (and internationally unlawful) actions in Palestine. A world of difference intentionally ignored by the smear press, and seemingly by Freedland as well.Andy StelmanBishops Castle, Shropshire '¢ Jonathan Freedland has no need to apologise for imagining the worst. After the previously unimaginable genocide suffered by European Jews in the last century, how could anyone expect a Jewish person, or indeed any person, to be free of fear again? All the more reason to be equally clear. It is preposterous and irresponsible to associate, as Freedland does, the prospect of a Corbyn government with the fates of those who 'never made it out in time'ù. Jeff WallaceCardiff '¢ Thank you yet again, Jonathan Freedland, this time for explaining so clearly the dilemma Jewish voters face, which many of us had not properly understood before. Why can Corbyn not see that the only hope for the future of the Labour party is a promise from him now that following the election, which he cannot win outright, he will stand down? Is he really so insulated from reality that he cannot see the damage he is doing?Alison WatsonLondon  '¢ Jonathan Freedland poses the dilemma for many Jewish remainers between voting for an antisemitic Labour leadership and a hard-Brexit Tory party. But I was surprised that he did not mention the obvious alternative. The Liberal Democrats are genuinely welcoming to all people and intolerant of all forms of racism, and they are committed to remaining in the EU, either by revoking article 50 if they should win, or supporting a people's vote in cooperation with other parties. As many Jewish people tend to live in the same areas as each other, such as the three constituencies of the London borough of Barnet, a collective Jewish vote for the Lib Dems would be an effective and viable choice for electing MPs representing a party that has, at its heart, the interests of a large proportion of the population that includes Jewish remainers.

"In the Tory heartlands of the commuter belt, remainers may revolt",0,Neutral,"Back in September, Boris Johnson had a meeting with some of the 21 Tory MPs who were about to lose the party whip over their opposition to a no-deal Brexit. He was warned that if he was prepared to risk the hardest of Brexits, he might lose crucial parliamentary seats - reliably Tory places where a majority backed remain. One of the people present was Anne Milton, the MP for Guildford, the large Surrey town won by the Tories in 2017 with 55% of the vote and a 17,000 majority. She says she expressed her fears of defeat, only to have them thrown back at her. 'If Guildford's lost, it's lost,'said the prime minister, and that was that. Two months later, Milton is standing as an independent, Guildford may well be a four-way marginal - and one of the election's most fascinating stories is rolling on. In the face of all the noise about 'Workington Man'and the purported significance of leave-voting seats in the north of England, this particular subplot has been overlooked. It is about the extinguishing of David Cameron's Tory 'modernisation'project - and the growing disconnect between voters in affluent Conservative heartlands and the ludicrous ideology of Jacob Rees-Mogg and the European Research Group. While the Tories have been transforming themselves into the nationalist, Pooterish party of hard Brexit, essentially cosmopolitan attitudes - open, internationalist - have been seeping into the formerly Conservative areas of our cities, and the suburbs and towns around them. Some of this was evident in 2017, in the seats lost by the Tories to both Labour and the Liberal Democrats: Bath, Kingston and Surbiton, Battersea, Enfield Southgate. The same story is reflected in the weakening Conservative presence around Manchester and Bristol - and Lib Dem targets such as St Albans in Hertfordshire. But perhaps the most interesting story lies in Surrey, that traditional signifier of true-blue Tory England. Until recently, the county had 11 Tory MPs. But by the time the election was called, the Conservatives had expelled Anne Milton, Philip Hammond and Sam Gyimah (now a Lib Dem). In local elections this May, the Tories lost 117 council seats in Surrey and control of four local authorities. Among Surrey's eight remaining Tory MPs are such Brexiters as Dominic Raab, Michael Gove and Kwasi Kwarteng. But in the borough of Guildford, remain got 56.2% in the 2016 referendum; in Woking, 56.2%; in Elmbridge, which includes Raab's seat of Esher and Walton, nearly 60%. I went to Guildford last week. Of late, it may have seemed rock-solid Tory. But way back in 2001, the Lib Dems took it with a majority of 538 - which, combined with an uptick in 2017 and recent gains in local elections, seems to have convinced them they can win again. Two years ago, Labour got close to a not-unreasonable 20% of the vote. Obviously, the Conservatives are still a force to be reckoned with. But now that Milton has been thrown out of the Conservatives and is running a campaign so far based on 'a smartphone and a laptop'ù, there is a clear sense of no one having a clue what will happen: it's the election in microcosm. When I talked to people in the centre of town and observed some Lib Dem canvassing in the upscale neighbourhood of Onslow, one thing was striking: as well as a smattering of staunch and sometimes angry Brexit supporters, there were many people who said that post-2016 Conservatism had left them feeling abandoned. 'Labour and the Tories are too extreme,'said one man, who up to now had been a loyal Conservative. 'I want a centrist party.'These days, 'centrist'is usually thrown around as an insult; he said it with a sense of pained loss. A little earlier, I had met a churchgoing couple in their 60s - he a geologist, she a self-described housewife - who had often voted Conservative down the years, but were also switching. 'It feels like we have to vote on Brexit, and we're remainers,'they said. It is easy to still think of the home counties in terms of a quintessentially suburban mindset - prim, reactionary, moralistic and deeply Conservative, with both small and large Cs. The massively popular 1970s sitcom Terry and June, a camped-up glimpse of a couple trying and failing to live the perfect middle-class life, was set in Purley, on the outer London/Surrey borders. In the songs of those ageless sons of Surrey, the Jam, there are portraits of characters who fit much the same picture: Mr Clean ('Getting pissed at the annual office do/A smart blue suit, and you went to Cambridge, too'ù), and Smithers-Jones, the hapless commuter who 'stops off at the corner shop to buy the Times'ù, turns up to work as usual and suddenly gets the sack. Immerse yourself in those songs, and you hear a world that endures, but is also in the midst of change. The population of Surrey is becoming more ethnically diverse, and as people are priced out of London, they are bringing a more cosmopolitan culture with them. On Guildford's north side, the University of Surrey draws in a multitude of people from overseas, and lots of students from London. The town's support for remain reflects a blunt economic question: if your livelihood is dependent on the capital's booming economy, why would you vote to leave the EU? And so to another question: what does post-Cameron, Rees-Moggist, Brexit-or-bust Conservatism really have to say to people in what we still know as the commuter belt? Perhaps the usual Tory warnings about Labour's tax plans will cut through; maybe dislike and mistrust of Jeremy Corbyn will do its work. But through the seemingly endless Tory mishaps of the last couple of weeks, I started to sense a party that well knows that the ground under its feet is shifting. When parties start to become accident-prone, there are usually deep reasons why. The sense of Conservatism weakening in its own heartlands is surely some of the explanation. This story might not necessarily be about heavy losses in five weeks' time. What is happening may be moving more slowly and unpredictably than that. But any Conservative with their eye on the Tories' long-term prospects would be well advised to think very hard. Parts of England are drifting away from a political tradition that once represented them as a matter of instinct, but that now seems to be lost in a murk of nostalgia and Brexit dogma. And whatever the daily hurly-burly of the election campaign, it is these things that tend to decide whether or not political parties have a future.

The hidden fight for the City could drive Leave voters towards Farage,0,Neutral,"One of the many contradictions in Boris Johnson's election prospectus is the plan to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by December 2020 and at the same time break free, by his own definition, of EU control. It's a contradiction that has, among other things, spurred Nigel Farage to threaten to field 600 candidates in the general election. Farage rightly says that the only way Johnson can sign a deal within a year is if he maintains the current alignment with the EU and all its rules. And if this is his plan, any chance of merrily signing free trade deals with other countries is sunk. 'It doesn't get Brexit done,'he told his followers last week. 'It is not Brexit; it's a sellout.'Of course Farage has in mind his old mucker and chlorinated-chicken pedlar Donald Trump when he thinks of trade deals. Trump can't make headway with the EU on trade, and while Britain stays aligned with Brussels, Washington will find it just as hard to strike deals with London. That's the message to Tory Leave voters, and to a large extent it is true. The arguments around alignment are well-rehearsed and focus on EU demands that Britain observe a raft of rules, on areas from food standards (hence the ban on chlorinated chicken) and employment regulations to fishing rights. One area that is rarely mentioned concerns the City of London, which is strange when the EU is especially concerned at the loss of London's banking, insurance and asset management industries, clustered in the Square Mile and Canary Wharf. As an international centre of finance, London ranks above New York and Tokyo in terms of foreign banks located in one place. These banks bring with them a deep well of funds and the kind of 'flexible financial solutions'that London's accountants and corporate lawyers are only too keen to deploy. Even now, most large companies based in the EU come to London to woo international investors and encourage them to plough funds into their businesses. Italian banks, German manufacturers and French pharmaceutical companies unhesitatingly bypass their own financial centres when the time comes to raise some cash. Likewise, indebted EU governments look to London's debt markets as a source of funds. Once London lies outside the EU, tolerance of it as a money laundering centre, ever willing to cleanse the ill-gotten gains of Russian oligarchs, is expected to wane. Its new status as a tax haven may also become a threat. Brussels has a two-pronged strategy. The first part is to build up its own internal resources, bringing together its banking sector under one umbrella rulebook. The Germans have proved to be one of the main barriers to any sharing across Europe's financial sector. But last week saw the first moves by Berlin to create a full eurozone banking union. Finance minister Olaf Scholz signalled that he would drop opposition to a common scheme to protect savers' deposits, telling the Financial Times that Europe's global role would be undermined if it failed to complete the integration of the eurozone's financial sector. 'The need to deepen and complete European banking union is undeniable,'he said. 'After years of discussion, the deadlock has to end.'The second aim is to keep London as close as possible to the EU's evolving rulebook. In this way it would be prevented from branching out to become the western equivalent of Singapore, which has become wildly popular with bankers and investors after adopting a simple, laissez-faire set of regulations. For much of this year, UK banks have reported privately that their attempts to gain licences to operate in the EU have met increasingly tough responses as officials in Brussels panic about maintaining London's compliance. This not only means more staff moving from London to Paris and Frankfurt - it also signals to London's largely foreign-dominated banking sector that much of their European business will need to be conducted inside the EU's borders unless the UK agrees to full compliance with Brussels. Of course, European integration is likely to move slowly, especially given the animosities and resentments that still exist on the continent - between the north and the south, and also between the east and the west. So Europe might not sing with one voice. Yet that is likely to make for even slower progress on UK trade talks than otherwise, given that most EU countries agree they want to keep London close. Conservative voters may wake up to this reality during the campaign. It would be fanciful to believe that Tory Remainers will see the contradictions as a reason to revoke article 50 or accept a second referendum. Tory Leavers, though, might fall in behind Farage.

"Thoughts on the Lib Dem, Green and Plaid Cymru remain election pact",0,Neutral,"The Greens' electoral alliance with the Liberal Democrats (and Plaid Cymru) risks throwing their eco-socialism out with the remain bathwater (Report, 8 November). Greens have far more in common with Labour. Unlike the Lib Dems, Labour and the Greens support the radical transformation of society. Labour's target is decarbonisation by 2030, the Lib Dems' is 2045. Like 56% of voters (Majority of UK public back 2030 zero-carbon target - poll, 7 November), Greens are more likely to support Labour's policy. It is no coincidence that only Labour and Green MPs are contributors to Extinction Rebellion's handbook This Is Not A Drill. Back in April, protesters chained themselves to Jeremy Corbyn's gate, not Jo Swinson's, saying he was the 'best hope this country has got'to meet the challenges of the climate crisis. Furthermore, it is Labour's shadow chancellor who promises to use every lever of government to fight the climate emergency. Like the Greens, Labour would never enter a coalition with the austerity-creating Tories. On Europe, the Greens and Labour support the most democratic solution (a second referendum) and their politicians play active and influential roles in the pro-remain leftwing Another Europe is Possible campaign. The climate emergency is the most important issue facing us. For this reason, tactical votes in marginal seats should be for Labour. The risk - in this uniquely important election - is letting in the hard Brexit Tories. And like Labour voters, Greens understand how destructive this will be in the fight against the climate emergency.Magi YoungExeter '¢ Almost 33 years ago, in January 1987, you published a letter from Nina Fishman, the Labour and trade union activist, calling for a tactical voting campaign for the coming general election. She was hoping to at least offset the coming third victory of Margaret Thatcher to some extent. That letter led to the first significant organised television campaign. Sadly, Nina died in 2009 (you published an excellent obituary of her by Donald Sassoon). She would have been frustrated to see that electoral reform has still not been introduced for UK elections, and sad about the Labour party's failure to understand the value of tactical voting. Among other things, that gave us a majority Tory government in 2015, and hence the Brexit crisis. But she would have been delighted by the historic pact between Liberal Democrats, Greens and Plaid Cymru. This is the first proper application of tactical voting by established parties. It could well deprive the Tories of a majority on 12 December. If Labour was able to enter a similar agreement it could do far more.Tim JohnsonLondon '¢ It is ironic that Unite to Remain, founded by Heidi Allen when she was an Independent MP, has become a three-way deal between the Liberal Democrats, Greens and Plaid Cymru, excluding the only grassroots pro-remain independent with a chance of winning: Claire Wright in East Devon.

The Brexicon: six words the dictionary has missed - from Brino to Releaver,0,Neutral,"It turns out there is one British industry that has been boosted by Brexit. Unfortunately, lexicography - that is compiling dictionaries to you and me - doesn't employ quite as many people as, say, making cars. Never mind. The tortuous process of leaving the EU has created a mini word-boom, and at least the people at Collins have been capitalising on it. On Thursday the dictionary company released its Brexicon: 10 words that it says define Brexit, from cakeism to flextension. But what did they miss out? If you're a Brexit purist, then anything short of sealing off the channel tunnel and daubing a 'v'sign on the white cliffs of Dover is 'Brino'ù, or Brexit in name only. But how do you pronounce it? I'm tempted to go with 'bree-no'ù, but it must have been inspired by the US political slur 'Rino'- Republican in name only - which sounds like 'rhino'ù. Answers on a postcard, please. An acronym that has come to define a certain type of obsessive remainer, does anyone now remember what the label tacked on to thousands of Twitter profiles stands for? Well, it's 'follow back, pro-EU'ù, and started out as a project to build a network of like-minded users on social media. For what exactly? It isn't clear that the FBPE 'movement'has achieved anything very concrete. But who knows? Perhaps the hashtag aimed at connecting people has in fact spawned the odd Euro-romance. Let us know if that's you. I thought it was a city in Canada (oops, that's Yellowknife), but apparently it's a songbird. Oh, and the codename for the civil service plan to deal with a no-deal Brexit. That possibility may have receded for the time being, but personally I find it reassuring that the country has spent £2.1bn preparing for something entirely avoidable that now probably isn't going to happen. Don't you? Whatever happened to the releavers? Up until the 2017 election they seemed to be all the rage - a cohort of people who had voted remain but were resigned to Brexit. They just wanted the government to get on with it. Then Theresa May lost her majority and it began to seem as if there was every possibility we might not leave the EU at all. With Boris Johnson having secured a new deal, and staying in looking less likely again, will the releavers roar back to life? This December's election may depend on it. An appropriately biblical-sounding word for the fact that Brexit has made a lot of people want to get out of here. According to Full Fact, the number of EU citizens leaving the UK increased from around 95,000 in the year before the referendum to 145,000 by September 2018. Companies have been relocating, too: more than 330 City firms have moved or are moving parts of their businesses to places such as Dublin and Luxembourg. More worrying still is the fact that EU nurses - which in London account for 20% of all staff - are upping sticks in greater numbers than ever before. At this point BOB - bored of Brexit - describes approximately 100% of the UK population and everyone in the rest of the EU, too. Some Americans may still be interested, but mainly because they enjoyed hearing the former speaker shouting 'Order!'and 'Bambos Charalambous'and don't realise he has gone now. Even the most fervent Moggite or Faragist will admit to feeling slightly jaded about the whole process, surely? Those sunlit uplands do seem rather a long time coming.

Keir Starmer: Tories' doctored TV footage is 'act of desperation',-0.25,Negative,"Keir Starmer has accused the Conservatives of 'an act of desperation that backfired'after footage of the shadow Brexit secretary was doctored to show him unable to answer a question on Labour's Brexit position. In the Tory version of an interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain, produced by the party for its social media channels, Starmer is shown unable to speak after being asked about Labour's position on the EU, with his face appearing under the caption 'Labour has no plan for Brexit'ù. In reality, the shadow Brexit secretary did provide a lengthy answer regarding his discussions with other EU countries over the past three years and insisted: 'A customs union and single market alignment and protection of workers' rights and environmental rights and consumer rights is something that can be negotiated.'The Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan said that Starmer's answer may have been 'unconvincing'but the way the video was edited by the Tories was 'misleading and unfair'ù. Speaking on Wednesday at a campaign event in Lambeth, south London, Starmer said political parties should not get involved in doctoring videos of their political opponents. 'I actually saw it as an act of desperation. It is only when you think things are not going well that you get involved in those sorts of activities. 'I think this particular matter has backfired for the Conservatives because they have spent all morning trying to defend what they did,'he told the Guardian. After being called out on the party's decision to edit the video, the Conservative party failed to apologise and appeared to revel in the extra attention. Its press office encouraged more people to watch the original 'car-crash interview'on Good Morning Britain.

Is this version better?'The new film is almost identical to the original, but instead of misleadingly showing Starmer blinking and licking his lips as he fails to respond to Morgan's question, it instead freezes the frame on his face and zooms in. The Conservative chairman, James Cleverly, told BBC Breakfast the video was 'obviously edited'and denied it had been 'doctored'ù, saying the difference mattered because the words had different connotations: 'The idea that people couldn't see that it wasn't a shorter form of video, that's not a credible position to put forward.'Starmer said Cleverly has been caught out. 'I know Cleverly has tried to laugh it off as satire but he knows what he was up to,'he said. The incident highlights the difficulty in reporting on misinformation and online duplicity during a general election. The extra attention given to misleading social media posts often creates a feedback loop, with algorithms on Twitter and Facebook responding to the high levels of user engagement by pushing it into more people's feeds. This has led to fears that there is very little to be lost by political parties reinforcing lies and deceptive material in a media environment where the aim is often to get attention at all costs and by any means. After the misleading edit of the video was highlighted by the BBC journalist Daniel Sandford, the video attracted almost a million additional views. ",0,Neutral
Philip Hammond to step down as Tory MP after 22 years,0,Neutral,"Philip Hammond, the Conservative chancellor until four months ago, is standing down as an MP of 22 years after clashing repeatedly  with Boris Johnson over Brexit. The MP for Runnymede and Weybridge, who lost the party whip last month after opposing leaving the EU without a deal, said he had been forced to step down because he would lose his party membership if he stood against an official Conservative candidate. His resignation comes as another Tory rebel, the former justice secretary David Gauke, accused the government of breaking a promise to give MPs a vote on extending the post-Brexit transition period to avoid a no-deal Brexit. On Tuesday night, Johnson officially launched the Conservatives' general election campaign, positioning himself as someone who would 'cheer, not sneer'entrepreneurs, while painting his opponent Jeremy Corbyn as someone who demonises billionaires with 'relish and a vindictiveness'ù. In an article in the Telegraph, Johnson laid out his party's manifesto priorities - Brexit, the NHS, education and law and order - all areas his messaging has been focusing on since he was elected leader in the summer. Johnson claimed Brexit would unlock billions in investment for the UK while Labour would delay it further. He promised to build 40 new hospitals, increase funding for every school and put more police on the street who would use stop-and-search powers more frequently.  Hammond, 63, is the latest of the 21 Tory rebels, who voted in September for the Benn act averting a no-deal Brexit to announce they are standing down. In a letter to his constituents, he said he could only stand as a candidate if he was prepared to oppose an official Tory party candidate, but was not prepared to do so. 'I am saddened to find myself in this position after 45 years of Conservative party membership, 22 years of service as a Conservative MP, 12 years as an opposition frontbench spokesman and over nine years as a cabinet minister, including serving as defence secretary, foreign secretary and chancellor of the exchequer. 'If I fight the general election as an independent conservative candidate against an official Conservative party candidate, I would cease to be a member of the party.'In a veiled threat that he intended to continue to oppose hardline Conservatives who are trying to force one nation Tories out of the party, Hammond said he would continue to argue for a 'broad-based, forward-looking, pro-business and pro-markets centre-right party'ù. 'I will remain as a party member and I will continue to make the case for doing whatever is necessary to deliver a negotiated close future trade and security partnership between the UK and the EU,'he wrote. Gauke's accusation of a broken promise was in response to the prime minister's official spokesman who answered 'a simple no'when asked on Tuesday if MPs would get a vote on prolonging the transition. The spokesman insisted there would be no need for an extension because the UK and the EU would have agreed a free trade deal by December 2020. Gauke responded on Twitter: 'Looks like the Conservative message is 'òwe'll be out on WTO terms by 2021'. I have to say - that is reckless.'Another rebel who has left the Tories, the former education secretary Justine Greening, said on Tuesday she would find it difficult to vote for the party under Johnson. 'I certainly don't want to see us getting on with what I think would be a very damaging deal for Britain. So it would be very hard for me to vote for the Conservatives, if I'm looking at what they stand for on Brexit,'she told Radio 5 Live. Anne Milton, another of the 21 MPs, announced on Tuesday that she would stand as an independent candidate in her Surrey seat of Guildford, where she has a 17,000 majority. 'I wrote to the PM yesterday to tell him I felt unable to be a Conservative candidate,'she said. Several of the still-whipless MPs say they do not plan to stand again in the election, including Ken Clarke, who will step down after just short of 50 years in the Commons, and Rory Stewart, who has launched a bid to become mayor of London as an independent. In a separate development, the Conservatives have come under fire for misleadingly editing a video of Labour's Keir Starmer, to make him appear unable to answer a question on Brexit.  On Wednesday, Johnson is expected to head to Buckingham Palace for an audience with the Queen before returning to parliament to announce the formal start of the general election. Later, he will appear at the Conservatives' first official election rally at which he will repeat his slogan that the party must 'get Brexit done'by changing 'this blockading parliament'ù.

"The Guardian view on political advertising: time to regulate it, Mr Zuckerberg",0,Neutral,"The decision by Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, to 'stop all political advertising on Twitter globally'was the right thing to do at the right time. There is understandable queasiness about paid-for political reach enabled by 'highly optimized and targeted'messaging whose extent and spread is largely unknown and unregulated. When two of the world's most advanced democracies - the United States and the United Kingdom - have been undermined by the flood of prejudice and falsehood on social media, it is heartening that Mr Dorsey has acted. It should worry us all that politicians and the social media giant Facebook have not. In Britain electoral law is, according to parliament's public administration and constitutional affairs committee, in an 'archaic and confusing state'that requires deep reform. MPs said there were plans for digital imprints showing who has produced online ads, and called for a wider review of digital campaigning in the UK. However, such welcome pledges are easier to make than to keep. They echo similar calls by the Electoral Commission after the 2016 Brexit referendum, the Law Commission before that, and also in Boris Johnson's now-defunct Queen's speech. Fine words, but nothing has happened. Dishonest campaigning, opaque data harvesting and dark political advertising all flourish. Mr Dorsey's message is being warmly received, which ought to perhaps worry his real target: Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, casts his company as part of a 'fifth estate '¶ a new kind of force in the world'which gives the public a megaphone to 'express themselves at scale (online)'ù. There's evidence that social media adverts help unknown candidates to stand out. It is also the case that nontraditional candidates would find it harder to break through without Facebook. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, has also defended activists across the world from sophisticated cyber-attacks. However, Mr Zuckerberg confuses freedom of expression with freedom of paid intensification and dilation of that expression - which favours the rich. Facebook's power over what users see gives it potential for immense influence on politics. Foreign and domestic actors have long realised this and pushed misinformation and division. Facebook has created rules for itself that are quixotic and confused. The company will not police politicians' posts - including any containing false and misleading claims - but will decide, it seems, whether an individual is a politician or not. Mr Zuckerberg is on shaky ground and the quicker he realises this the better. Facebook is worth about half a trillion dollars. It sucks up four-fifths of global social networking revenue. In the US, Democrat senator Elizabeth Warren is quite right to say that the company has 'too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy'ù. It does need to be broken up. However, even if this were attempted it would likely be a lengthy process. In the UK, the worry is that politicians understand that the integrity of elections can be undermined by Facebook, but political leaders are reluctant to clamp down as they benefit from it. There are some simple things that could be done: forcing Facebook to reveal where parties are spending campaign cash and enforcing constituency spending limits would be a start. An official study of advertising in social media is urgently needed. Campaigners have to be able to be held to account. They cannot operate in the dark. That means subjecting their political activities, and the companies that give them this voice online, to effective regulatory oversight. ",0.75,Positive
Trump's interference in UK political affairs,-0.125,Negative,"Your article (Trump tells Johnson and Farage to team up, 1 November) made disturbing reading. We rightly resent and complain against Russian or Chinese interferences with our elections. Donald Trump's, by contrast, is blatant, aggressive, and affects not only the mechanism of election but its very structure, including who should form alliances with whom. This deserves the severest rebuke to the president. It is possible that Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson dislike Jeremy Corbyn. However, one would have thought that they would respect and love their country enough not to have it interfered with in this way. One very much hopes that they will condemn this interference as loudly and as unambiguously as they have condemned other foreign interferences with our democracy.Bhikhu ParekhLabour, House of Lords '¢ Donald Trump's intervention into UK domestic affairs reminds me of another American who dared to so venture, a few days before the 1975 EU referendum.

First, Knievel took the microphone to warn parents and children alike on the danger of drugs, to warm applause. Then, the mistake: urging the UK to remain in the EU. What business was it of his, we muttered? As he repeatedly rehearsed his approach run, we lost patience, shouting: 'Get on with it!'He did, and crashed.

The People's Vote campaign has run aground - but it has one last chance,0.125,Positive,"The polls have barely moved. Not the polls for the general election, but the ones on voting intention in a second referendum. They show a country as sharply divided on the question as last time. Now remain has shaded a few points into the lead - but most polls find 'don't know'stubbornly high. The conventional wisdom in 2016 was that these voters would break for remain in the final days. Conventional wisdom was confounded. Leaks from the People's Vote campaign as it has crumbled into infighting show it to be still in thrall to that conventional wisdom - certain that all we have to do is wait, and remain will triumph. Thin on ideas, complacent on strategy, it seems to have little in the way of targets, even the most obvious of all: converting the split electorate into a social majority. Strategic blunders have characterised the campaign since its inception. The most glaring, and the one now pulling the campaign apart, is that it slips between arguing for a second referendum as a democratic necessity - as a means for popular sanction or rejection of the terms of any deal - and for a second referendum because it is the most expedient route to remaining in the EU. Really moving the needle on Brexit would require getting wavering leavers on side, but the campaign's efforts to do so have been minimal: it prefers to inveigh against its pantheon of folk-devils, from Jacob Rees-Mogg and Dominic Cummings to Jeremy Corbyn. Quietly, some of its organisers accept that it has struggled to escape its reputation as an establishment mafia; its prominent organisational caste of washed-up spin doctors, political exiles and job-hungry apparatchiks hasn't helped. When Boris Johnson's withdrawal bill looked close to passing last week, it seemed time for the campaign's last rites to be read. The general election has granted it a reprieve, but one in which its serious options are now few. It is astonishing that People's Vote should have squandered its obvious opportunities: it is well funded, operating with resources that would make most single-issue campaigns sick with envy. The campaign has simply failed to learn the lessons of the first referendum. The remain campaign in 2016 had the unenviable task of uniting left and right in defence of a political arrangement they liked for different reasons: the right for the EU's opening up of markets and liberalisation of economies; the left because of freedom of movement and cultural exchange, and the European court of justice's tendency to act as a bulwark against the worst excesses of British governments. They settled on an arid defence of technocracy with a healthy dose of fear. That strategy remains broadly unchanged, though there are other strings to the bow: confronted with a choice between articulating a political argument for a new vote that could bring leavers on board, and exploiting the newfound - if ersatz - enthusiasm for the EU among the remainer base, it has pivoted heavily towards the latter. This is consistent: the groups organising for a People's Vote have always assumed that to get a referendum means they will win it; that means keeping their base fired-up and intransigent. Remain's highest-profile campaigners are ebullient partisans in the Brexit culture war, blending seamlessly with the digital fringes of Remainia as they muse about leavers' relative education levels and the manipulative effects of numbers on the side of buses. This is not the serious self-examination of a losing side, but the injured outrage of people who believe they ought to have won, marred by snobbery and self-exculpation. Caroline Lucas has been one of the few remainer politicians to take the loss seriously. Her 'Dear Leavers'video campaign recognised the desire to give the establishment a kicking, and tried to understand the vote as motivated by Britain's astonishing regional inequality, its debased democracy, and the long, slow destruction of its social settlement. The political strategy that might emerge from this excavation would involve more difficult work than the uncritical EU boosterism that's now in vogue; it would require a relentless accounting of the failures of successive British governments, too often and too easily blamed on Europe. Instead, People's Vote has persisted in the belief that there is a latent majority in Britain for both a second referendum and a vote to remain. In its more grotesque form, this assumes that demographic shift is the agent of change: as older leavers die off, a wave of younger voters will flood to the ballot box to smash Brexit for good. Recent political history is littered with failed progressive movements that pinned their electoral hopes on such shifts. The strategy is an apolitical one: an unreliable youth wave takes the place of attempts to politically persuade wavering leave voters to change their vote, or think about how the gulf between both poles could be bridged. In an intensely politicised moment, this is insufficient. MPs affiliated to the People's Vote campaign also dreamed that such a majority might emerge as an exasperated and deadlocked parliament turned its eyes to a second vote. That dream - never credible against parliamentary arithmetic - is done. The chances of a People's Vote now depend entirely on the complexion of the next government. The most notable success of the People's Vote has been to tar the Labour party with the Brexit brush, and disillusion many of its most ardent remainer voters. It is a rich irony, therefore, that its only hope of success now lies in a Labour government. For all the scorn poured on Jeremy Corbyn by PV functionaries, the Labour party, under his leadership, opposed Theresa May's deal, and it opposes Johnson's harder version of the same text. Any future People's Vote can only be built on Labour foundations. It is also party policy. Labour's activist base and its parliamentary cohort is overwhelmingly for remain; it is acutely aware, however, that a sizeable chunk of its voters were for leave. The Labour party has always thought of itself as a party of the whole nation; it is instinctively averse to the Liberal Democrats' current strategy, which is geared to appeal to an enthused fifth of the country by promising revocation without further democratic exercise. The rollout of dodgy tactical voting sites directing remainers to choose the Lib Dems even in seats where they finished a distant third in 2017 - like the one launched this week by Best for Britain - may end up handing Johnson the Brexit of his dreams by turning Labour-Tory marginals blue. Labour's cautious strategy will not always please PVers, who sometimes mirror the ERG's impatience to 'get Brexit done'ù. But the party is right to intuit that its offer of a second referendum must be presented with a plausible option to leave - with improved guarantees on workers' rights, watered down in Johnson's deal - and that Brexit itself should always be considered alongside its wider social and economic programme. Refusing to pretend politics began on 23 June 2016 allows Labour to touch on the deep inequalities and democratic atrophy that churned underneath the Brexit referendum. Reintroducing those questions to Brexit might also provide the People's Vote with the only means to reach beyond their remainiac base. People's Vote has been granted a reprieve. It may be a bitter pill for many of its campaigners to swallow, but the truth is this: the fate of a second referendum now depends on Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party.

I quit Twitter and haven't looked back - my fellow MPs should do the same,0,Neutral,"For over three years, parliament has been going around in circles, progressing to nowhere, consumed by debate about how to respond to the 2016 referendum decision to leave the European Union. Despite a majority of current MPs voting in support of invoking article 50 and standing for election in 2017 on manifesto commitments to leave, a majority of them have been unwilling to allow Brexit to be delivered. This impasse has led to deep frustration in parliament and in wider society, creating divisions within communities and families as well as among politicians. Brexit has poisoned civil debate. It's a boil that needs to be lanced, which is why I've supported the prime minister's decision to hold a general election, even though I'd like to have seen Brexit delivered first. However, I do think that the degree of poison and unpleasantness, and the threat to our political stability, is at risk of being exaggerated. The danger to individuals and to civil society was much greater during the miners' strike and the three-day week in 1974. There is no real threat to civil order in the current Brexit debate. Yes, the local police have called in to my office after concerns were raised about my safety. And along with many other MPs, I've had security measures installed in my constituency offices and at my home. But the reality is that it's tiddlywinks compared with the abuse I received in 1997 when I stood as a Conservative candidate. I vividly remember being chased up a garden path by a political opponent with a pitchfork - and being attacked by a dog that destroyed a pair of my best campaign trousers. And I had to take evasive action to avoid being run down by an angry adversary in his Land Rover. Politics has always been a highly charged and occasionally brutal business. Today's abuse is nothing new. The main reason that poison is increasingly seeping into our political discourse is the exponential growth of social media. In some ways it can be beneficial for public engagement - but the damage it causes outweighs the good. Anonymous comment posted by keyboard warriors, often with a total disregard for the truth, creates a cesspit of vileness - which is why I gave up on Twitter years ago. I haven't missed it a bit. Twitter is also the deathbed of humour, because posts are often met with synthetic outrage when the intent of the writer was actually entirely benign. That's why so much of what appears on Twitter is mind-numbingly boring. I used it for a while but stopped about two years ago in favour of Facebook, where debate is (mostly) constructive. Of course, people should be free to share their thoughts wherever they wish - but if you don't enjoy it, just stop doing it. The plethora of protest movements that have grown over recent years have been organised largely on social media - and give the impression that the level of civil disorder has increased. There has indeed been more 'noise'ù, but the level of threat and unpleasantness in our country is nothing like as bad as is being portrayed in the insatiable hunger to fill news space. Yet my advice to anyone who has had enough of the cacophony is to get off Twitter. You won't regret it. '¢ Glyn Davies is the Conservative MP for Montgomeryshire ",-0.125,Negative
Backing Labour's Brexit position,0,Neutral,"My old friend Andrew Murray is correct to say that Labour cannot afford to obsess over remain in the election campaign (Labour should stay neutral on Brexit, says key adviser, 31 October). It does not have to. Remain is a decision that should be taken by the people, not the political elites of party leaders and advisers, still less the offshore-owned press and the US-financed outfits that have been campaigning against Europe all this century. Labour now has a clear policy of offering a referendum on Brexit. That is a good democratic offer and strongly supported by Labour leaders like John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry, most MPs and nearly all party activists, as well as the party conference. One can have pointless 'how many angels dancing on the head of a pin'debates about Labour's talks with Brussels in the event of Labour heading a government, but Brussels is used to such processes. Look at Labour's talks after winning power in 1974 followed by the 1975 referendum, or the Danish and Irish talks on their status in the EU after voters said no in their referendums. Labour's key message should be 'trust the people'after the hopeless mess political elites have made of Brexit since 2016. In effect Labour can make a two-for-one manifesto offer. Vote Labour and you firstly get policies addressing the disastrous austerity legacy of Tory-Lib Dem ministers between 2010 and 2015 and, secondly, you get the right that Boris Johnson will deny you to decide the nation's future relations with our friends and partners in Europe.Dr Denis MacShaneFormer Europe minister '¢ In your profile of Andrew Murray, Labour's chief of staff, rightly asserts that 'politics takes a while to catch up with economics'but that the financial crash of 2008 has left those wanting a return to New Labour or 'business as usual'with nowhere to go. Neoliberalism has run its course. Where he is rather less perceptive is failing to recognise that his own politics have hit exactly the same problem. Lexit, the dream of 'socialism in one country'ù, or even a go-it-alone Keynesianism, ran out of road more than four decades ago. For all European nations the optimal economic area is now continental in scale. All the main production processes rely on integrated supply chains, operating across borders. Everywhere, there has been a huge surge in cross-border commercial activity. That's why 10,000 freight vehicles a day pass through Dover and around 4.4 million lorry journeys are made between the rest of the EU and the UK each year. For the left and progressives generally, the alternative to hyper-globalisation cannot be a retreat to nationalist boltholes. Rather it has to develop a trans-European strategy that corresponds to the realities of the 21st-century economy and the profound challenges thrown up by the environmental crisis.

Beware of tactical voting websites,0,Neutral,"Many readers will wish to vote tactically to defeat the Conservatives and prevent Brexit. But they should be wary of relying on advice from the Best for Britain website getvoting.org (Labour attacks remainer tactical voting website for offering 'òbogus advice', 31 October). For my postcode, on 30 October it recommended that to get a pro-EU MP I should vote Lib Dem. Yet I have a pro-EU Labour MP who in 2017 polled 35,116 votes. The Lib Dem candidate polled only 1,343 votes. After I raised concerns it has changed to recommend Labour. I also understand that in a number of Labour/Conservative marginals the website recommended voting Lib Dem. I'm unaware if these have been corrected.

Polls show voters aren't sick of politics - they're eager to have their say,0,Neutral,"In politics, feelings are powerful. We are used to the idea that politicians can harness our anger, or our fear, to get us to believe certain things and behave in certain ways. But more and more, it is not our anger or fear that politicians appeal to, but our exhaustion. Exhaustion has become a rhetorical weapon for both sides of the Brexit divide: from some Brexiteers embracing the slogan 'Bored of Brexit, Pass The Deal'ù, to the remainers claiming that only revoking article 50 will avoid years of wrangling over our new relationship with the EU. Equally, it is a political cudgel against MPs (remain or leave) who refuse to take an 'easy'way out of Brexit, demanding more time for scrutiny of the deal, or a more careful, deliberative process for the public to have their say. This works because Westminster seems to believe it. For political journalists, 'Brenda from Bristol'remains a symbol of the public mood - 'I can't stand this - there's too much politics going on at the moment,'she said when Theresa May called a snap general election in 2017. Knocking on Brenda's door has become a strange new ritual for political journalists whenever new elections are rumoured. But with yet another general election six weeks away, exhaustion does not capture how we really feel about politics. In fact, the era of 'too much politics'- which began after the 2015 general election - has seen a heightened level of interest in politics, reversing a sharp decline in the early 2010s. According to the Hansard Society, Brexit and the recent wave of elections have acted as 'electric shock therapy'for political engagement. Recent months have also revealed the public's willingness to consume politics: viewing figures for BBC Parliament have spiked, especially during key moments in the Brexit process. The public, on balance, actually welcomes the snap election. Across a swath of polling data, the most direct questions indicate that opposition to an election is running at just 20-30%, while support is in the 40s. There are nuances to this: in other polls, people narrowly back a referendum over an election, while remainers tend to be most favourable to having any electoral event (an election or referendum) take place. However, none of the data supports the idea that we are a nation of Brendas. Indeed, even in 2017 Brenda was an outlier: after Theresa May called the election, voters said it was the right thing to do by a 3:1 margin. Why, then, is Westminster so willing to believe that Brenda speaks for Britain? The first reason is that in recent years politicians and journalists have treated 'apathy'as a key challenge to the political system in Britain. That began with the 2001 election and its very low turnout, and continued in 2015 with Russell Brand's call for mass abstention. This way of thinking has dominated most political journalists' careers, and has likely informed their view of how the average Briton feels about politics. The second is Westminster's growing anxieties about its isolation from a 'real Britain'outside London. Because national politics is so centred on the capital, political journalists fear that Westminster seems alien to the large majority who live beyond the M25. Giving prominence to the Brendas among us, then, is intended to show that political obsessives can understand how people feel outside the bubble. But in doing so it overcorrects, exaggerating public disengagement. Of course, rising public interest in politics doesn't guarantee that turnout will increase or even hold up. Indeed, there are valid concerns about what a bleak midwinter election could do to turnout. Britain so rarely has general elections in winter that it is hard to judge. Research has shown that at council by-elections, which do take place throughout the year, turnout is between three to nine percentage points lower in December than in any other month. Yet with the heightened stakes of a general election, voters might feel it is worth the effort to brave the cold and the dark. The public, then, is still engaged with politics, and ready for whatever an election may bring. If anything keeps people away from the polls this winter, it's more likely to be snow than 'Brexhaustion'ù. Of course, we may eventually reach a point where political exhaustion does set in - but it may be that passions and fears over Brexit prevent that moment from ever arriving. At a time when the Brexit outcome has become so important to our political identities, can there ever really be 'too much politics'ù?

Michel Barnier tells UK: ignore EU regulatory standards at your peril,0,Neutral,"British companies risk trade barriers to the European Union if a future government seeks to abandon EU standards on workers' rights and environmental protection, Michel Barnier has signalled. In an interview with the Guardian and seven other European newspapers, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator said any British government would face a 'proportional'response if it sought to roll back core social, environmental and consumer standards. The EU and UK have agreed to negotiate a free-trade agreement as part of Boris Johnson's revamped Brexit deal, but Barnier stressed that tariff and quota-free access to the EU were linked to maintaining regulatory standards. 'Access to our markets will be proportional to the commitments taken to the common rules,'he said. 'The agreement we are ready to discuss is zero tariffs, zero quotas, zero dumping.'While he did not go into details on the EU's response to 'dumping'- ie products made cheap by unfair competition - he said measures would be 'proportional'ù. Government ministers have denied reports of any divergence from EU regulation on workers' rights and the environment, after the Financial Times obtained a leaked document that said the two sides would have 'a very different'interpretation of those standards. Labour is alarmed the government wants to tear up worker and consumer rights, after Boris Johnson abandoned Theresa May's promise for the UK to match future upgrades to EU standards. The prime minister has promised to abide by existing standards to maintain 'the level playing field'the EU requires to negotiate a free-trade agreement. Barnier said maintaining 'fair'competition, rather than 'wild'deregulation, was in the interests of the UK, and he warned that the EU-UK free-trade deal could be blocked by any one of three dozen national or regional parliaments. 'Don't underestimate the difficulties of the process of ratification,'he said, referring to the trade deal, but also other agreements the UK must negotiate in the coming years. 'If it is not ratified, we return to zero.'Speaking in his first interview since being appointed one week ago to lead the EU's taskforce on future relations with the UK, Barnier also said: It would not be possible to negotiate the UK's entire future with the EU in the 'very, very short'time of 11 months, although he thought a basic free-trade deal could be struck in that period. The UK had 'underestimated'the consequences of leaving the EU and its single market and customs union, and now faced 'a difficulty to accept the consequences'ù. The June 2016 vote had been an 'electroshock'for the EU and it remained 'urgent'for member states to learn lessons and respond to 'social anger'in areas that had lost jobs and industries. Barnier was speaking shortly before parliament debated a snap December election that would deepen the uncertainty over Brexit. Brexit is scheduled for 31 January at the latest, leaving the UK just 11 months to negotiate a future relationship that covers trade, security, foreign policy and numerous technical topics, including transport and fisheries. Barnier said the EU would be ready to launch negotiations on the future 'the day after'the withdrawal agreement was ratified. His team would prioritise trade and security among other topics, while some subjects would take more time. 'We cannot do everything in 11 months, we will need more time,'he said. In a potentially helpful intervention for Johnson, Barnier said it would be possible to negotiate 'the principle elements'of a free-trade agreement to avoid an economic cliff edge before the end of 2020. That means by January 2021, the UK would have a basic free-trade deal with its biggest market, an outcome estimated by experts at the UK in a Changing Europe programme to reduce GDP per person between 2.3% and 7% within a decade. Barnier disagreed with suggestions that extending the transition period was inevitable, but said the UK would have to pay a 'proportional'contribution to the EU budget to remain in the single market beyond 2020. The withdrawal agreement allows a one-off extension of either one or two years. Barnier said Brexit talks had taken longer than the EU expected, adding that 'due to the British political situation we are obliged to be patient'ù. He now has a one-year, renewable mandate to oversee the EU's future ties with the EU. European leaders were impatient to end 'this negative negotiation of separation and divorce and to open a new page on the future relations'he said. 'And we are preparing for this. We are ready for this.'",-0.75,Negative
Untangling Brexit: will the UK have a winter election?,0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson lost a third parliamentary vote intended to trigger a December general election and accused the current House of Commons of being 'incapable'of delivering Brexit. Johnson needed a two-thirds majority of all MPs - 434 votes - under the 2011 Fixed-term Parliament Act. The result was 299 votes for and 70 against after Labour abstained. Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would not agree to anything until the government's intentions became clear. He said the party would 'consider carefully'any legislation which 'locks in'the date of an election. Absolutely. The government is willing to work with the Liberal Democrats and the SNP to get an election a different way. They will propose a bill which the smaller opposition parties have indicated they will back - as long as the Tories guarantee that Brexit doesn't happen before then. This would require a simple majority, which appears to be achievable for the government. The sticking point is the date of the election. Johnson is insisting on a 12 December poll, while the Lib Dems want one three days earlier. Corbyn appeared to suggest in parliament that his party could also back the Lib Dem plan under certain unspecified conditions. Sources close to Corbyn say they do want an election but that they have argued against another national vote because they do not trust Johnson to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Corbyn indicated that he would now consider the possibility of supporting an election after Johnson officially accepted the EU's offer of an extension to the Brexit process to 31 January. Many Labour MPs and activists fear their party could struggle in an election before Brexit happens because the party's position remains unclear. However, Corbyn loyalists argue that once the public sees the Labour leader on the campaign stump, the party will win over voters and defy the polls as they did during the 2017 election. Johnson might also suffer under pressure from Nigel Farage's Brexit party for failing to deliver on his 'do or die'promise to deliver Brexit by 31 October, they claim. Conservative MPs and ministers are concerned that they could come under pressure if an election is held before delivering Brexit, but Downing Street is determined to press ahead with one, buoyed by internal polling. The prime minister's aides believe that only with a decent majority - rather than his current minority of 45 - will he be able to deliver his Brexit proposals. ",-0.375,Negative
EU begins planning for trade negotiations after UK agrees to Brexit extension,0,Neutral,"The EU will start strategising for the post-Brexit trade negotiations with the UK at a December leaders' summit following Boris Johnson's formal agreement to an extension to 31 January 2020. There is renewed confidence in Brussels that the UK is moving towards a general election and resolution of the first Brexit phase. Johnson's attempt to secure both a short period for pushing the withdrawal agreement bill through the Commons as well as a post-Brexit general election on 12 December was defeated on Monday evening. But there are signs that there may still be a majority for a pre-Brexit general election after the government indicated it would table a bill allowing that to happen. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, gave his most positive comments yet about a December poll in his statement to the Commons following the vote on Monday evening. 'We agree that an early election is necessary,'he said. The French government is leading the way in insisting that in December the EU's 27 members should sit down in the cold light of day to hold discussions on strategy for the future negotiations over the relationship with the UK. An √âlysÈe palace official said: 'It's healthy to sit down and lay out our ideas for future negotiations, to stop reacting in the heat of the moment to this or that Brexit event.'Earlier on Monday, the EU agreed to a Brexit extension to 31 January 2020, with the option for the UK to leave earlier if a deal is ratified, clearing the way for opposition parties to back a general election. After a 30-minute meeting of European ambassadors, Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said the EU27 had agreed to the request made by the British prime minister just over a week ago. Johnson, who said he would rather die in a ditch than delay Brexit, was under an obligation to agree to the terms, breaking his pledge to leave on 31 October, 'no ifs, no buts '¶ do or die'ù. He later sent a letter insisting that the delay was 'unwanted'but confirmed 'the UK's formal agreement to this extension'ù. He added he hoped the EU would insist that this would be the last extension but no such pledge was made by any heads of member states or heads of the bloc's institutions. Sources in Brussels said they would not make any commitments that could be a 'hostage to fortune'ù. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament's Brexit coordinator, tweeted: 'Relieved that finally no one died in a ditch. Whether the UK's democratic choice is revoke or an orderly withdraw, confirmed or not in a second referendum, the uncertainty of Brexit has gone on for far too long. This extra time must deliver a way forward.'Under the terms of the extension, the UK has three months more of EU membership but it can leave on the first day of any of those months if the withdrawal agreement is ratified in both Westminster and the European parliament in the meantime. The EU has insisted it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement again. The UK also has 'an obligation'to nominate a candidate to join the European commission. The prime minister has previously said he will not put forward a nominee. By agreeing the extension through a written procedure, to be completed by Wednesday at the latest, EU leaders will avoid convening for a summit in Brussels. 'Tusk will launch the written procedure among EU27 with a deadline of 24 hours,'an EU source said. Emmanuel Macron's office said France had worked all weekend to insist on very clear conditions written 'in black and white'to allow the UK's Brexit extension. An √âlysÈe official said: 'All weekend, France took the initiative with Germany, Ireland, Donald Tusk's team and a few other countries, to fix the terms of the extension very precisely: that the withdrawal agreement isn't renegotiable, that the UK would follow a code of conduct and allow the EU's 27 members to meet to discuss other issues for their future [such as the budget], and that the UK must legally appoint a commissioner if the European commission sits before the UK leaves.'The √âlysÈe said France's long-held preference for a much shorter extension had focussed minds, applied pressure and allowed those clear conditions to be put in place. After Macron was styled by some media as seeking to put a spanner in the works of a longer extension, the √âlysÈe official said this had never been France's line. 'A veto or extension is not our approach. We always build a collective solution in the end ... The most important issue is the unity of the EU's 27 members. We wanted to preserve that unity without creating a crisis over Brexit. Because the worst outcome would be for Brexit 'î a British political crisis 'î to be imported to the EU and spread a form of poison and division that we don't want.'The EU Withdrawal (No 2) Act, often referred to as the Benn act, is a law that was passed by MPs in an attempt to prevent Boris Johnson's government leaving the EU without a deal. It specifies that by 19 October the government must have either secured a deal that parliament has approved, or secured explicit approval from parliament to leave without a deal. If neither of those conditions are met - and if Johnson cannot get his deal passed on 'super Saturday' - it requires the prime minister to write to the EU to ask for a further Brexit extension. The form of the letter that the prime minister must send is set out in full in the act. The act says the extension should last until 31 January 2020, or longer if the EU suggests. Here is the full text of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act 2019 Martin Belam The source added that France's main concern was to stay out of British internal politics and to ensure that a Brexit extension was justified. 'Some said we were playing Boris Johnson's game, or the British opposition's game. We have never tried to take any part in Britain's internal game.'The official said Macron had no interest in imposing a General de Gaulle or Napoleon-inspired 'splendid isolation'within the EU. During the ambassadors' meeting, France's representative complained that the three-month extension would lift the pressure on MPs to ratify the revised withdrawal agreement, but reluctantly gave his support, EU sources said.

The European Union and protecting workers' rights,0,Neutral,"While Larry Elliott runs an interesting rule over the vexed question of workplace rights (The EU is no defender of workers' rights, 25 October), he makes no attempt to trace the broader picture, which is odd for someone who, in company with Dan Atkinson, made such a damning indictment of British short-termism in their book Going South. Workers' rights will be a sideshow issue if we jump off the cliff with no deal (or this latest Boris deal) at the end of 2020. While I'm sentimentally attracted to this country running more of its own show, research by bodies like the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development show we are beset by poor senior management standards and declining spending on investment and R&D. Ever since Margaret Thatcher and Nigel Lawson decided that we should have a boot sale of our companies we have been reliant on the kindness of foreigners. And those multinationals and investors will depart these shores in droves in the face of tariffs and lorry delays. I just wish the leave brigade would show me the blueprint for how this country intends to jerk dramatically back into life to face global competition.David RedshawGravesend, Kent '¢ I read with some bemusement the contention by Larry Elliot that membership of the EU has done nothing for worker health and safety. The most significant piece of health and safety legislation in the past 30 years is the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1992, emanating solely from the EU. It enshrined in statute the concept of risk assessment, a simple but spectacularly successful idea that employers should consider the hazards of their undertaking and take steps to eliminate or reduce them prior to being put on notice by an accident. The terms of the EC directive make it plain that the motivation was to reduce the high level of workplace injury throughout Europe, at the same time as ensuring that no member country obtained an unfair economic and competitive advantage by a race to the bottom. As a result fatal injuries in the UK workplace have reduced from 425 in 1989 to an average over the last three years of 141 per annum. Non-fatal injuries have reduced by 58% since 1986. These figures are in the public domain on the Health and Safety Executive website. In the immortal words of Bill Clinton: 'It's not opinion; it's arithmetic, honey.'ùRonald E ConwaySolicitor advocate, Glasgow '¢ As a former head of a trade union international department, I can agree with much of Larry Elliott's arguments that the EU bureaucrats did not initiate laws protecting workers' rights, although he might have mentioned the tragedy that was John Major's specific rejection of the Social Chapter, a position maintained through the Blair and Cameron years. However, the issue now is that 'protecting workers' rights under Brexit'is really a code for saying that we must resist the plan of Boris Johnson and the right to turn the UK into an offshore enterprise zone with minimum workers' rights, undercutting European workers and driving their conditions down in a race to the bottom. This is a clear and specific reason for remaining in - and reforming - the EU.Dr John FisherRetired TGWU official, Eastleigh, Hampshire '¢ Thank goodness for Larry Elliott, who completely demolishes the idea that the EU will defend workers from the Tories. Only a strong Labour and trade union movement can do that, Brexit or remain. Reliance on the EU to defend workers has always distracted from this truism.Ted WatsonBrighton '¢ Larry Elliott is right that the EU seeks to ensure a level playing field of employment conditions, which provide an equality of market competition across member countries. As he notes, that primarily helps employers rather than employees. What he doesn't say is that the whole point of Johnson's Brexit deal is to allow the UK to leave that level playing field and push employment conditions even more in favour of employers.

No 10 says it could back Lib Dem plan for 9 December election,0,Neutral,"Downing Street has indicated it will back a plan by the Liberal Democrats to change the law in order to hold a December election if Labour refuses to back Boris Johnson's motion for an early poll. A No 10 source attempted to put pressure on Labour to back its motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act for an election on 12 December, saying the government would turn to the Lib Dem plan as an alternative. Johnson needs Labour support to get a two-thirds majority for an election under current legislation, and Jeremy Corbyn is refusing to back one while the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is still alive. Over the weekend, the Lib Dems offered to help Johnson change the law to allow an election on 9 December, which would need only a simple majority in parliament. A No 10 source said: 'Tonight is Labour's last chance to have an election with Brexit delivered - they can vote for the 12th and get Brexit done before. If not, we will introduce a bill almost identical to the Lib Dem/SNP one tomorrow. 'This parliament has repeatedly failed to deliver on its promise to respect the referendum. Millions of families and businesses can't plan because of constant delays. We need a new parliament by Christmas so we can get Brexit done in January and the country can move on.'It is not clear how the government's proposal for a bill would differ and it is possible that No 10 could be using the idea to put pressure on Labour before tabling legislation that the Lib Dems could not back. However, Lib Dem sources indicated they would be willing to support any legislation that was fundamentally similar to their own and confirmed they would not pursue amendments in order to ensure the bill had the best chance possible of getting through. It is understood that the bill would need to be tabled on Tuesday and passed by Thursday in order for a 9 December election to take place.  Corbyn suggested on Monday that his party could abstain on the government motion on Monday but back the Lib Dem plan. 'We will consider carefully any legislation on an early election,'he said, adding that a date needed to be locked down in law to prevent Johnson from trying to move it for his own advantage. Corbyn also suggested he would want an election to be held earlier than 12 December and before students break up for the winter holiday, saying any plan would need to 'protect the voting rights of all of our citizens'ù. Earlier, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, framed the situation as 'the Lib Dem and Tory pact of 2010 being re-established'ù. He said: 'They are back together, selling out the People's Vote campaign and the cross-party campaign to prevent a no deal. The Lib Dems will stop at nothing to get their ministerial cars back.'Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, hit back at McDonnell, tweeting: 'In the last 10 days I've addressed a #PeoplesVote March and tabled an amendment to the Queen's speech that would have given us a people's vote. Your leader did neither. Don't lecture me about fighting for a people's vote.'",-0.125,Negative
Europe is failing to stand up to the bullies who threaten democracy,0,Neutral,"The rise of nationalism and the historic threat to liberalism sweeping the global system poses big strategic questions for European democracies. Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin share an ideological belief in the language of race and nation combined with a winner-takes-all view of international diplomacy. By undermining the multilateral system the new authoritarians threaten a return to the assumptions of a previous era: a world of empires, not institutions. This makes Europe a central crucible for what happens next. As the Yale historian Timothy Snyder argues, the EU is largely made up of states that were forced to give up their empires and so had no choice but to pursue multilateralism. Europe's nationalists substitute the realities of this history with the national myth. They have become a major part of the EU's own internal politics as the likes of Matteo Salvini, Viktor Orb√°n and Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski develop a fierce challenge to liberalism. This raises a question over how democratic leaders should behave in the face of a new generation of statesmen who do not believe in mutual cooperation. Here the German sociologist Max Weber might help us. He drew a distinction between conviction and responsibility. He warned that acting with conviction could be wrong if the consequences were negative. Blaming others for the results was of limited value. Instead it was better to take responsibility and reckon directly 'ò'òwith exactly those average human failings'ù. But what if, we might wonder, it can also be irresponsible to refuse to act out of conviction? For the EU looks most at risk of precisely this failing. Despite all the focus on Brexit there was not one but three decisions made at the recent European council that were of high significance to the future of Europe and the world. And a failure to act with conviction to defend liberal values could be seen across each. First, the EU struck a deal with Boris Johnson that endangers economic cooperation in Europe. While it is true that the agreement preserves the EU's red lines in relation to the Irish border, it has little else to recommend it. By moving most of the UK in the direction of a basic future relationship with no safety net on workers', consumer and environmental rights, the deal would create an aggressively deregulating competitor in the EU's geographical neighbourhood. Johnson would go swiftly into the arms of Trump's America, combining clearly the toxic mix of nationalism and free market economics that is threatening global democracy. The US has promised a fast-track trade deal within nine months. 'It's a great win for us,'a British government spokesperson said just weeks ago. Second, with Turkey having attacked Kurdish-controlled areas in Syria, the EU chose the easy path of condemnation over action, declining to pursue either tough economic sanctions, military assistance to the Kurdish resistance or peacekeeping forces. This decision compounded existing EU failures on Syria. EU states have treated the refugee crisis as a security, not humanitarian, issue, to be largely resolved by agreement with Turkey to keep migrants out by force. Backed by Putin, the Assad regime has now moved into the Kurdish areas, signalling a major victory and the defeat of Syria's democratic hopes. Third, EU leaders reneged on historic promises to the peoples of the Balkan region, declining, under pressure from France, to begin accession talks with North Macedonia and Albania. In a decision many believed to be motivated by French domestic hostility to immigration, Emmanuel Macron has strengthened nationalists across the Balkan region. Some will argue that the Brexit deal was inevitable once Johnson backed down. But the EU is perfectly capable of acting in a pragmatic and political way. For instance, with Salvini gone from the Italian government, the European commission is likely to show greater flexibility over the Italian budget deficit. And it was within the power of the European council to delay a deal with the UK. It could have argued, quite reasonably, that Johnson had only brought credible proposals at the 11th hour. This would have compelled him to seek an extension and in all likelihood would have led to a UK general election in which he was forced to stand on a 'no deal'platform. These decisions may turn out to have been serious missteps in the global drift to authoritarianism. Recognising that democracy is facing an international attack should be the starting point for European diplomacy. We should be seeking to build an EU that is open to the rest of the world and committed to democracy, the rule of law and social justice with a forceful approach to the far right. Instead, the opponents of global democracy, I fear, have been strengthened.

Journalists' duty to seek the bigger picture,0.125,Positive,"Gary Younge's brilliant article (In its deference to the powerful, our media are failing us, 25 October) highlights the vital role of curiosity, scepticism and challenging the powerful on behalf of readers.

"From epic myths to rural fables, how our national turmoil created 'òBrexlit'",0,Neutral,"Some are epic tales of the ancient kings who battled to rule Britain. Others are books about bakers in abandoned northern towns or novels about mild-mannered fascists in 1930s rural England. As works of fiction go, they do not seem to have much in common - but together, they represent the growth of a subtle and complex new movement in contemporary British literature: Brexlit. Brexlit is uniting literary authors across genres, settings and sales brackets. And unlike nonfiction about Brexit, it offers escape as well as insight: an opportunity to understand the nuances of Britain's decision to leave the EU in a fictional world where, possibly, no such vote has ever taken place. Now, five very distinct and fascinating strands of Brexlit have been identified by Robert Eaglestone, professor of contemporary literature and thought at Royal Holloway, University of London. Brexlit, he says, is not just big state-of-the-nation novels that are explicitly about Brexit and were published in the immediate aftermath of the referendum: Jonathan Coe's Middle England or Ali Smith's Autumn. In fact, some Brexlit novels explore issues of national identity in relation to Brexit without necessarily being marketed as a response to the UK's departure from the EU at all. Eaglestone gives the example of Sarah Moss's 2018 novel, Ghost Wall, which purports to be about an archaeological experiment: 'It's clearly tied up with Brexit and ideas about history.'The story is told from the point of view of a young girl whose abusive father is desperate to experience life in Britain's ancient past. 'It's an investigation of the power of the past and the way that leads - and in fact, empowers - forms of abuse. It's trying to say something about how an unthinking rootedness of the myths of the past can turn out to be extraordinarily dangerous in the present.'But while authors like Moss are critiquing a new kind of virulent English nationalism and its hunger for a distant mythical past, others are writing historical bestsellers that celebrate English masculinity and the formation of England against all sorts of foreign enemies, from the Vikings to the Scots. Here, Eaglestone highlights the work of Bernard Cornwell: 'His concern as a writer is that all that creation of Englishness - King Alfred burning the cakes and so on - has been forgotten. And the English people need to recover a kind of English identity.'Similarly, fiction set in a plucky England during the second world war, where everyone pulled together and the country stood alone against the continent, could also be categorised as a form of Brexlit, says Eaglestone. Postcolonial fiction is part of the movement too, although these texts have been investigating perceptions about race, immigration and national identity in Britain for years - Brexit merely adds a new layer of complexity. Eaglestone believes that fiction provides authors and readers with a more reflective space in which they can try to make sense of Brexit and consider its historical undercurrents. 'When major historical events occur, I think they change what we see about our past.'This is fuelling one of the biggest trends of Brexlit: a return to thinking about fascism and how extremists get into power. All Among the Barley, Melissa Harrison's novel set in rural England during the 1930s, is one such novel. 'It's about the dangers of nationalism, nativism and creeping fungus of fascism,'she says. Although she never intended it to be a parable about Brexit, the referendum result made her want to explore what happens when people in the English countryside start to accept and allow extremist beliefs, or resist change. 'Another theme of the book is the danger of disempowering people. When people feel they have no voice and no agency at all, they will find a way to take some. And that is completely human.'Novels about 'the left behind'make up another strand of Brexlit. In Drunken Baker by Barney Farmer, characters created for the celebrated Viz comic strip Drunken Bakers are immortalised in a book 'so soaked in booze the pages almost smell'ù, according to one critic. It's a comic novel that takes place over a single day: as the bakers get drunker and fail to bake, they reflect on their failures in life and the decline of everything around them. 'You see the impact of the collapse of a northern town from the point of view of the bakery workers. And it's just so full of despair. It's very, very bleak.'It was a book, Farmer says, that 'changed nothing'ù: his next Brexlit novel, Coketown, is out on 1 November. 'I'm interested in the people that politics creates. When it comes to cause and effect, the cause is endlessly discussed. But the effect on the individual is more interesting to me, as a writer, than the grand personalities and the great sweep of events. There is more for writers to reveal by approaching political writing from that angle.'",-0.125,Negative
The Observer view on Boris Johnson undermining British politics,0,Neutral,"All the laws, rules and procedures that govern our politics cannot disguise a simple truth. Democracy can't simply be enforced by the courts, imposed with ballot boxes, fulfilled by the marking of a cross. It relies on an honour code: the tacit agreement by those who take part that they will cherish and abide by its principles; that the majority, if not all, of its participants will act in good faith, criticising their opponents on points of substance but not seeking to undermine democracy's constitutional underpinnings. What is happening in Britain today shows how extraordinarily quickly the rot can set in. Our political honour code is breaking down, unleashing a race to the bottom that the good men and women who sit in parliament can only watch unfold with horror. The most frightening thing is that we do not yet know where this road ends; it is entirely conceivable that things will get worse before they get better. What started with the 2016 European referendum campaign, which unleashed a decades-long Conservative civil war into the open, has culminated in that party imposing a prime minister on Britain who thinks nothing of adopting the delegitimisation of our sovereign parliament as a political campaign strategy. The Leave campaigns were infected with an insidious populism right from the start. Leave politicians denied there would be any trade-offs in leaving the EU and voters were told they could have it all: a more sovereign UK, a burgeoning economy, revitalised public services funded by a cash injection from the money saved on EU membership and lower levels of immigration. Boris Johnson put his name to a letter that spoke of the 'rapidly accelerating pace'of Turkey's accession negotiations, despite the fact it is no closer to joining the EU than it was 10 years ago, while the Vote Leave campaign, of which he was a key figurehead, produced a poster claiming 'Turkey, population 76 million, is joining the EU'ù. Earlier this year, he told the barefaced lie that he did not mention Turkey in the campaign. Vote Leave also broke the law on campaign funding. That campaign has had serious and lasting consequences for the conduct of British politics. It is responsible for the political mess we now find ourselves in; Leave politicians have over the past three years conclusively demonstrated the extent to which what they promised voters was a unicorn and they have been unable to negotiate a deal that can win the support of our elected representatives in parliament. And it also seeded a political culture in which our prime minister seeks to avoid taking any responsibility for this situation by blaming all his misfortunes on parliament. Anonymous government sources have stooped as low as briefing that there would be lynchings and killings if there were a confirmatory referendum. They have briefed out blatant untruths that have been reported as government lines, including that No 10 had ordered an investigation into collusion with foreign powers by MPs such as Hilary Benn and Oliver Letwin (it had not); that Operation Yellowhammer documents had been leaked by a former minister, implicitly pointing the finger at Philip Hammond (the documents were dated after he left government); and that Amber Rudd was given ample opportunity to see the government's legal advice on the prorogation of parliament before she resigned (she was not). The prime minister and his official spokesperson have also been responsible for misleading parliament and voters. Johnson has claimed that parliament approved his deal, which he knows it has not. He said he would not prorogue parliament and then tried to shut it down for five weeks. He said he would deliver Brexit 'do or die'by 31 October, but almost certainly will not. He said he would pull the withdrawal agreement bill altogether if MPs voted against his ridiculous three-day timetable for scrutiny of hugely complex legislation, and he did not. He has proffered pledges to Labour MPs and to voters that he will maintain worker rights, consumer protections and environmental standards, even as leaked government documents reveal that he plans to do no such thing, as his stated public position of wanting the UK to diverge in a regulatory sense from the EU always implied. Johnson is openly undermining parliament in order to avoid democratic scrutiny for his actions. He cancelled his appearance in front of select committee chairs at the House of Commons liaison committee for a third time in a row last week. When MPs voted for more time to scrutinise the withdrawal agreement bill, he accused them of acting in bad faith to scupper his plans. And on Thursday his spokesperson made a childish threat that the government would go 'on strike'and withhold all legislation if MPs did not back his call for a general election, only to withdraw it hours later. He has threatened to table an election motion every day that parliament sits until MPs accede, even though this would not be allowed under parliamentary conventions. The prime minister is making a petulant joke of our democratic institutions. Instead of answering to parliament, he makes announcements in short media clips that offer little opportunity for grilling him on the inconsistencies in what he says. This goes beyond Brexit. Every committed democrat should be appalled at the prime minister's tactics. They risk undermining trust in democracy far more than the implementation of a bad Brexit deal that lacks a democratic mandate because it is supposedly what the country voted for in 2016. Unless we somehow pull ourselves back from the brink and find a way to rekindle a respect for the democratic norms and constitutional principles we once held dear, who knows where this will end?

Migrant deaths: Britain faces exclusion from elite EU policing unit,0.375,Positive,"The UK faces being excluded from Europe's anti-trafficking unit after Brexit, senior MPs and experts warned last night. The unit is coordinating international investigations into the deaths of 39 people whose bodies were found in the back of a lorry in Essex last week. The warning came as on Saturday the driver of the truck, Maurice Robinson, was charged with 39 counts of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people over the deaths in Grays. The 25-year-old will appear at Chelmsford magistrates court tomorrow, where he will also face 39 counts of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering. The anti-trafficking unit involved in the case, the European Migrant Smuggling Centre, is part of the EU's law enforcement agency, Europol, and has been at the heart of a global inquiry into the tragedy. A Europol source said investigators at the centre were 'working around the clock trying to put together the pieces of the puzzle'ù. The unit is regarded as the most sophisticated organisation of its kind in Europe, with unrivalled ability to track cross-border crime and a huge database of smuggling networks. But the UK's ability to participate in its work after 2020, when the post-Brexit transition period with the EU is due to end, is now in serious doubt. MPs and anti-trafficking experts said it was clear from the government's own statements that the UK would be excluded from Europol and its agencies in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and would at best have downgraded access even if a Brexit deal were done. The chair of the Commons select committee on home affairs, the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, said that she was seriously concerned that the government had no plan as to how to ensure continued UK involvement. Having put questions to the home secretary, Priti Patel, last week, Cooper told the Observer the tragedy was 'truly awful'and that she was deeply alarmed at the apparent lack of planning to ensure full access to the EU unit and its databases even in the event of a Brexit deal. 'The government's plans mean we could lose membership of Europol, including its European Migrant Smuggling Centre, at the end of next year if a new security partnership and treaty isn't agreed in time. 'The government itself has said this would mean a security downgrade and even in the best possible scenario there would be a substantial capability gap due to our loss of access to data and data-sharing systems and ability to lead operations as we currently do, including on human trafficking. At a time when we face a growing problem with this terrible crime it would be irresponsible to lose our close involvement with Europol and the Smuggling Centre, or to lose access to the huge criminal databases that help solve crimes.'She added: 'It is extremely concerning how little progress appears to have been made on developing post-Brexit plans for security.'This point was also stressed by the Tory chair of the Commons intelligence and security committee, Dominic Grieve: 'The dreadful tragedy highlights the need for international cooperation on people trafficking. Leaving the EU will make that much more difficult. At present there is complete uncertainty as to whether we will be able to continue working with this unit.'Europol officials say that in the event of no deal, British police officers would be removed from Europol's headquarters in the Hague. 'It's a very bleak prospect,'said a source. The source added it remained completely unclear what the organisation's future links would be with police in the UK. Senior figures at the United Nations also said that Brexit risked undermining the UK's ability to tackle people smugglers and trafficking syndicates. The UN's trafficking envoy, Maria Grazia Giammarinaro, told the Observer that withdrawing from Europol and Eurojust, which facilitates judicial cooperation among countries to tackle serious organised crime, could curtail the UK's ability to conduct the transnational investigations required to dismantle smuggling networks. 'Information sharing is crucial. Trafficking is very often a transnational crime, so the exchange of hot investigative information helps a lot. In addition, the European Union has very effective tools such as joint investigation teams that have proven very effective in sophisticated investigations,'she said. Meanwhile David Wood, former director general of immigration enforcement at the Home Office, told the Observer that pressure on UK ports would increase dramatically after Brexit and that the risk of tragedies like last week's would increase. He said Brexit would also involve the creation of a new visa regime that would involve a 'whole new tranche of individuals'who were not eligible for entry to the UK, which demanded greater levels of enforcement. 'That will be a new distraction and so things are likely to deteriorate. The resource you've got to deploy has already been reduced by austerity. The focus on small ports, for example, becomes extremely diluted.'A Home Office spokesperson said intensive work was going on to ensure the UK would have continued involvement in Europol and its agencies after the end of the transition period in 2020. 'The continued safety and security in the UK remains our top priority. The deal secured by the prime minister - including a close and ambitious security partnership - is the best way to protect our operational cooperation with European partners. 'We are actively engaging EU member states - in conjunction with operational partners - to prepare for all scenarios. This includes making sure that in no deal we are ready to transition law enforcement cooperation between the UK and EU member states and non-EU alternatives and we will continue to cooperate closely with Europol, including the European Migration Smuggling Centre, in any scenario.'The Labour MP Stephen Doughty, a member of the home affairs select committee, added: 'With all the focus on the economic aspects and damage to business and trade of Brexit, there has been far too little attention paid to how it will make us less safe and degrade our security cooperation in a whole range of areas. We lose access to crucial databases and information-sharing systems, which are vital.'Police were still questioning three other individuals on Saturday in custody on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and manslaughter. Elsewhere, attention shifted towards the remote Vietnamese province of Nghe An province where many of the 39 victims are believed to have begun their doomed journey. Detective chief inspector Martin Pasmore of Essex Police, leading the largest murder investigation in the force's history, urged members of the Vietnamese community in Britain and abroad to help identify the 31 men and eight women who died after being smuggled into the UK last week.

A 'No 10 source' is the voice of power. Too many journalists simply parrot it,0,Neutral,"The 19th-century fetishism of facts was justified by a fetishism of documents,'EH Carr wrote in his 1961 book What is History? 'But no document can tell us more than what the author of the document thought - what he thought had happened, what he thought ought to happen or would happen, or perhaps only what he wanted others to think he thought '¶ The facts, whether found in documents or not, have still to be processed by the historian before he can make any use of them.'For journalists, the 21st-century fetish appears to be with quotes. When powerful people say things, too many journalists simply convey them, acting not as critical interlocutors but convenient conduits. The fact that a politician has said something, apparently, makes it news. This is all too often conveyed neat - uncritiqued, unfiltered and unprocessed. It is then injected into the conversational bloodstream caffeinated by social media. It's as though the act of journalism is limited to getting the quote and distributing, and does not extend to verifying it, contextualising it and making sense of it. When those quotes are non-attributed - 'a senior No 10 source'or 'sources within the cabinet'- the risk of the journalist becoming an enabler and participant is real. By giving voice to those who are unnamed and, therefore, untraceable, they allow those with an agenda to broadcast it without taking responsibility for it. Mistaking power for perspective and forgoing analysis for access, they can end up not reporting on the machine but making it run more smoothly. This is in effect what happened on Tuesday, as Downing Street became aware that the government would probably win a meaningful vote on the second reading of Boris Johnson's Brexit deal but could lose the programme motion, and have to concede more time for parliamentary scrutiny. A 'Downing Street source'- we do not know who - told journalists that if the government lost on the programme motion it would withdraw the bill and demand an election. Journalists duly tweeted this as though it were a fact. This had a material effect. As the day progressed, the MP Oliver Letwin - who'd lost the Tory whip over his opposition to no deal - responded on Twitter: 'Getting seriously worried that HMG will pull Bill if Programme Motion is defeated. Surely best for all of us who regard this deal as the least of the evils to vote for the Programme Motion, whatever we really think of it.'But it was not a fact. It was a ploy. Johnson's brinkmanship in getting this far had, in effect, been to threaten everybody with everything: making enough Brexit hardliners fear that if they didn't accept his deal there would be a second referendum; and makingenough remain MPs fear that if they didn't accept his deal there would be no deal. On this thin and fraying thread hung his strategy to push through his deal by the self-imposed deadline of 31 October. But when faced with defeat, the government did not pull the bill. It paused the process. It was an empty threat. The only thing that made it plausible was the uncritical, unattributable reporting of it. Johnson did not invent playing the media in this way - though given his reputation for brazen dishonesty, the media's gullibility was particularly egregious. But with a general election imminent, it's worth casting a critical eye over the role journalism is playing in our politics. When the polling industry gave us misleading predictions in the run-up to the 1992 and 2015 elections, it understood that the reputation of the profession was at risk and set up inquiries to work out what had gone wrong. After the Iraq war, several outlets, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, published lengthy internal investigations into why and how they had misread the war's buildup and the claims over weapons of mass destruction. Despite a series of clear failures, the British media has gone through no such process. Many of the inequalities we see in our political class - its concentration in London, its class and racial bias - are replicated in the media class, shaping what Gramsci termed a prevailing 'common sense'ù. A report by the Sutton Trust and Social Mobility Commission this year shows there's a higher proportion of Oxbridge graduates writing columns at present than there is sitting in the House of Lords. Between them they settle on a consensus of what, and who, matters and then subject those outside their sphere to coverage that is more akin to anthropology than journalism. The upshot was most clearly witnessed during the 2017 general election, where the prospect of a Labour rout was not so much an opinion as a fact waiting to happen. Minutes before the polls closed, Piers Morgan tweeted his prediction: 'Conservatives to win by 90-100 seat majority.'Four minutes later the Sun's deputy political editor Steve Hawkes shared: 'Rumour Tories could be looking at 400 seats.'When the exit poll suggested a hung parliament, in which Labour had actually gained seats and vote share, the televised choreography could not have provided a clearer metaphor. 'Well, now let's go back to the studio to ask those who got everything wrong so far what will happen next.'They still have the mic. There was no reckoning. They are still out there forecasting the future. The mea culpas that followed that debacle were too narrowly tailored. Commentators lamented that they had predicted the wrong result, as though their job was to foresee the future. It wasn't. The problem was that they had chronically misportrayed the present, mistaking their own political prejudice for the situation they were actually covering. There are important differences between the kind of malpractice behind the cavalier use of unattributed quotes by a few senior journalists, and the wider failure to interrogate and understand the shifts in British politics. The former comes from a place that is craven - suggesting a greater desire to be trusted by those in authority than by readers or viewers. The problem is not that they don't know how to be sceptical: they were sceptical of Saddam Hussein when he said he had no WMD, or of Mark Duggan's family when they said he didn't have a gun. But when it comes to those in power they all too often err on the side of defence and credulity. The latter has been the result of a chronic lack of curiosity, underpinned by crippling cynicism towards new orthodoxies and possibilities. But where the two transgressions meet is in the belief that the establishment is to be trusted, either in its pronouncements or its framing, and always given the space to make its case unchallenged in a world where its legitimacy and credibility is withering away. With attacks on journalists on the rise, when the profession finds itself in the crosshairs of authoritarians, it is important to defend the media and those who work in it from the despot and the populist. Being honest about our shortcomings is central to that defence. In a period of rampant inequality, entrenched division and diminishing trust, we are most effective when we challenge the powerful, not when we embed ourselves among them.

Wary Tories say Johnson's election gamble could be seen as a stunt,0,Neutral,"Conservative MPs are privately concerned that Boris Johnson's call for a general election is a gamble that could easily backfire. Following Theresa May's failed bid to win a majority in the 2017 general election, there are nerves about advocating another national vote upon a fatigued electorate near to Christmas. One MP said the move, if successfully portrayed by Labour as a political stunt, could reinforce an image of Johnson as sneaky and untrustworthy. Under the 2011 Fixed-term Parliaments Act, Johnson needs 434 MPs to vote for a general election - two thirds of sitting MPs. He will be relying upon a majority of Conservative MPs to vote in favour of an election if he is to win on Monday. An MP from the centre of the parliamentary party said the move was a 'smoke and mirrors'trap that was meant to fail and anticipated that Labour would reject an election. However, it could easily backfire with some liberal voters, the MP said. 'This latest move is not intended to be a successful bid for an election. If it was going to be successful, at least 30 of my colleagues would vote against it,'the MP added. 'I worry that the public will look at the government and say, 'òWhy on earth are they farting about and trying to ruin my Christmas with an election when they have just won a vote on the Brexit bill? Where have they found these six weeks for an election when they don't have time to discuss Brexit legislation?' 'The miscalculation here is that the PM might be popular, but he is not trusted. And this manoeuvre, if the public don't buy it as genuine, might reinforce the impression that he is sneaky, untrustworthy and too clever by half.'Another MP said his parliamentary colleagues were in 'two minds'as to whether the move was a good idea, but added that most hoped Jeremy Corbyn would back down from whipping Labour MPs. 'The 2017 experience has scarred the party. We had a big lead and look what happened. Corbyn has shown that he can do it on the stump, even if we take into account that his brand has tanked somewhat.'Two former Conservative MPs who were removed from the party for voting against a no-deal Brexit have confirmed they will not vote for a general election. Several Scottish Tory MPs have also voiced fears about calling for a winter vote before Brexit has been delivered. One Scottish party source said: 'This would not wash with our voters. I hope my colleagues are right when they say that we won't get an election. We go for a vote in the spring, when a deal has been done.'Some senior Tories are concerned that Johnson will struggle to portray an election as a fight for Brexit, given that the withdrawal agreement bill was passed by MPs this week at its second reading. Paul Goodman, the editor of the influential website ConservativeHome, wrote on Thursday that going for an election was a high-risk strategy for Johnson. 'ConservativeHome is very cautious about making a dash for the line now, especially on the basis of a claim about the bill that doesn't necessarily stand up. 'To win, the party probably has to win a mass of northern and Midlands seats to make up for losses in London and the south. Is it really likely that the Tory campaign can, say, decapitate Tom Watson in West Bromwich, as the party aims to do, without Brexit having been delivered?'he said. Goodman, a former MP and party adviser, wrote that the Brexit party could gain seats from the Conservatives if an election was called before the bill had passed in to law. 'To our mind, Nigel Farage complaining that the Conservatives have yet again failed to achieve Brexit sounds more persuasive than him complaining that it has achieved a version he doesn't like. And the Brexit party factor will matter in a campaign: after all, its rise coincided with the fall of Theresa May,'he said. If Labour reject Johnson's offer of a general election and his motion fails to pass, the government looks set to go on strike. The prime minister's spokesman said: 'Nothing will come before parliament but the bare minimum. We will pursue a general election every day from then onwards, and do everything we can to get it. 'The prime minister wants to get his deal done by 31 October. If this parliament is unwilling to vote for a deal, then we will have to go for a general election. If there were a general election called, we would campaign on the fact that we've got a great deal that will get Brexit done.'",0.125,Positive
EU set to put Brexit delay on hold after Johnson's ultimatum,0.125,Positive,"The EU's plan to offer the UK an extension until 31 January on Friday is expected to be put on hold after Boris Johnson threatened to pull the Brexit deal if Jeremy Corbyn rejects a general election. Sources said the dramatic developments in Westminster needed to be fully understood and the choreography in Brussels could change. Donald Tusk, the European council chairman, had been expected to announce on Friday morning, following a meeting with ambassadors, that the EU27 had accepted the delay requested in a letter reluctantly sent by Johnson last Saturday. But senior EU sources said the developments in London had left the situation in flux. An announcement is expected on Monday or Tuesday. Suggestions that the Labour leader could reject Johnson's demand for a general election on 12 December provoking the prime minister to pull his deal set alarm bells ringing. Sources said the French government wanted to see the outcome of the vote on a general election before making a decision, but that the other 26 member states were ready to grant the three-month extension. The final offer could differ from the extension requested in the Benn act by specifying that the UK could leave on 15 November if the deal was ratified in the UK and European parliament. Before Johnson's ultimatum to the Labour leader, the EU looked set to offer a three-month extension, which could be cut short at the point at which the Brexit deal was ratified. It remains the most likely outcome. 'We don't want to be dragged into British politics and this is what was requested,'said one senior EU diplomat. 'They can leave earlier if they ratify the deal. To echo your prime minister, we just want Brexit done.'But France's EU minister, AmÈlie de Montchalin, told RTL radio that clarity over the next steps in London were needed for decisions to be made in 'the next hours and days'ù. She said: 'Our position is that simply giving more time - without political change, without ratification, without an election - would be useless '¶ The French position is to give more time if it is justified, if we understand why more time is needed. That could be more time to ratify, because there's a deal on the table. Or it could be because they say want to hold elections. Then we'll look at that. 'But it's one thing to say we'd like to maybe have elections and another thing to say elections have been organised '¶ Simply giving more time alone leads to getting stuck in a rut. If there's a clear scenario that will change things, for example a ratification or elections - not just suggested but organised - then we can take decisions. 'But we ask Britain for facts - we're not in fictional politics, we need facts to make decisions. Decisions will be taken in the next hours and days in terms of what the UK parliament says and what has really been actioned [in the UK]'ù. ",0,Neutral
An election would liberate Boris Johnson. But first he must get his deal through,0,Neutral,"The remainers have screwed up. After three years of dithering since the 2016 referendum, this last gasp of Britain's liberal establishment, once so confident and unassailable, has become a drawn-out howl of anguish. Ever since one of its former members, Boris Johnson, turned Caliban, he has roamed the political landscape, taunting his old associates at every turn. He threatens them with no-deal Brexits and general elections, and they shudder. He may be the weakest prime minister in recent history. But remainers have no idea how to respond. The prime minister now faces almost certain defeat over his rock-solid pledge, 'no ifs, no buts'ù, to leave the EU by 31 October. Assuming Brussels allows him to postpone Brexit to give him time to pass his withdrawal bill through parliament, he has two options. He can press ahead with that bill and risk delays and hostile amendments, or he can 'pause'it and attempt instead to get a pre-Christmas general election, which should give him more room for manoeuvre. For that, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, he needs Labour cooperation. In a bold bid to square the circle, Johnson has offered more time in parliament in return for Labour's agreement to an election date of 12 December. Labour must decide if it wants to be tied down in that way. In particular, will Johnson accept amendments to his bill over the next month that he might not like. He has one asset in hand: that the House of Commons has already voted on a second reading to pass his Brexit bill. He therefore needs only to survive the amendments stage. But his opponents would surely be wise to await the outcome of their amendments before agreeing to go to the country. Johnson should have every incentive to be extremely collaborative on such amendments. They might not suit some of his wilder backbenchers but they would get him from his present bind to where he wants to be, on the sunny uplands of an election campaign, where he is sure he can win a signal victory. Every tactical consideration should impel him towards a compromise on the bill - even if it might embrace a confirmatory referendum down the line. Just get it out of the way. Labour would be well advised to collaborate. Jeremy Corbyn and his disjointed band of remainers, half-leavers, soft-Brexiters and second-coming referendum-ers, have been wrongfooted at every turn. They should now concentrate on one thing, minimising the cost of Brexit to the economy. Their task should be to soften its impact. Now to stand in its way would see them massacred at the polls. Those eager to keep Britain as close as possible to Europe have more parliamentary power at this moment probably than ever since 2016, if only because they have what Johnson most wants, the key to an election. In return they must keep open the negotiating option in the transition period and with it the possibility of a customs union, a Norwegian option, the resolution of the Irish border nonsense, and the avoidance of chaos in the labour market. Johnson has no need to concede these red rags to his fundamentalist bulls, just the possibility of them emerging from the eventual negotiation. How far the terms of the negotiation need to be written into the withdrawal bill is moot. Clearly, with trust in Johnson's intentions at a low ebb, flexibility is all. The opposition needs only seek a transitional negotiation that leaves open 'a'customs union, if not 'the'one. Johnson has, after all, conceded one for Northern Ireland. Everything will then be to play for next year. As the BBC's Europe editor, Katya Adler, never ceases to remind us, the big battles are yet to come, in 2020. Those close to the Brussels negotiations have found parliament's obsession with the terms of withdrawal baffling and infuriating. It is the UK's future relationship with the EU that should matter, and that is yet to be settled. It is not withdrawal that may need 'postponing'ù, but the UK's place in Europe's overall trading community. We are not yet done with border checks, alignments, quotas and tariffs. Those horrors lie ahead. Johnson is understandably frustrated by Downing Street's lack of control over events. He should be reminded, daily, that this crisis is his doing. He knows that an election could liberate him from the bondage of a hung parliament. But that is why he has everything to gain from getting his bill, however bastardised, through the present Commons. References to future trade deals are really neither here nor there. Like all Johnson's Don Giovanni promises, they are words suited to passing circumstance. For their part, remainers must see a residual interest in passing Johnson's bill. The nocturnal litany of 'why no'simply has to shift to 'how yes'ù. This requires not reason but the art of politics. That art has long been seen as the genius of the British constitution. It has guided parliament through crisis after crisis, from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to the Great Reform Act of 1832 and the Parliament Act of 1911. Britain's parliament at no point lost control of events, whether to the crown, the judges or the streets. An election is clearly needed. A government must be able to govern, a prime minister to lead. A new parliament should allow tempers to cool and some concept of a national interest to revive. Perhaps the remainers can yet redeem themselves. They can eliminate Corbyn's 'risk of a no-deal crash-out'by agreeing Johnson's bill. They can try to keep open the option of a customs union and single market. They can soften Brexit as best they can. But that is for next year. For now, just pass the bill. '¢ Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist ",0.25,Positive
Johnson's cabinet split over gambling on pre-Christmas election,0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson's cabinet is divided over how to proceed with Brexit, as the prime minister faces the stark choice of pressing ahead with his deal or gambling his premiership on a pre-Christmas general election. After an inconclusive meeting with Jeremy Corbyn on Wednesday morning in an attempt to agree an acceptable timetable for parliament to consider the bill, the prime minister told MPs at Wednesday's PMQs that he was awaiting the decision of the EU27 over whether to grant an extension before settling his next move. The EU's decision is unlikely to come before Friday. Some cabinet ministers, including the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, are cautious about asking for an election. They believe the majority of 30 achieved by the government on the second reading of the Brexit bill on Tuesday suggests Johnson's deal has enough support to carry it through all its stages in parliament. Smith, who was Theresa May's chief whip, has examined the various amendments to the withdrawal agreement bill, and does not believe any of them would necessitate pulling it. 'Julian's view is that the numbers are there,'said an ally. Some Tory MPs said there also were serious misgivings on the back benches about the idea of an immediate election. 'There's a big, big fight going on, basically,'one said. 'The parliamentary party is split 50/50. Personally, I don't think an election is a very good idea.'Another said: 'I'd rather we focused more on passing the bill. It would be better to go to voters having finished the job. I feel that's what most colleagues want.'However, hard Brexit supporters appear to be more gung-ho, with leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg fearing support for the bill could yet fall away - if the 19 Labour rebels who backed it fail to secure the amendments they would like to see, for example. Members of the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG) are also nervous about the legislation being amended in a way that they would find unacceptable - such as obliging the government to seek a customs union. After Johnson's meeting with Corbyn on Wednesday, Downing Street briefed that Corbyn had 'made clear Labour have no policy except more delays'and hinted heavily that Johnson's next move would be to ask MPs to support a December election. 'Any time that parliament gets a vote for delay, it will always choose delay,'said a Downing Street source. 'Therefore, if this parliament is unwilling to vote for a deal, we will have to go for a general election.'Despite the bullish rhetoric, Johnson's chief whip, Mark Spencer, later met his Labour counterpart, Nick Brown, to explore whether a new timetable could be agreed for scrutinising the bill. That suggested the idea of trying to pilot the bill through parliament had not been ditched altogether - particularly if only a short extension is granted. In the meeting between the two party leaders, held in the same Westminster office where Corbyn had previously confronted May, Dominic Cummings suggested MPs should be prepared to sit all night to hit next week's Halloween deadline, according to one witness. Meanwhile, Johnson has been trying to persuade EU leaders not to grant an extension - or at least to keep it short. The PM spoke to Donald Tusk on Wednesday morning, telling the European council's president, who has called for EU leaders to allow a further Brexit extension, that he does not personally want a delay. He also discussed the issue with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Johnson's spokesman said: 'The PM was clear in restating his position that he does not believe that any delay beyond 31 October is in the interests of the UK or the EU and that we need to get the deal through parliament before that point.'The prime minister was forced to write to the EU on Saturday to seek a delay until 31 January under a backbench-instigated law averting no deal, but had hoped to rush the bill putting his plan into law through parliament this week, to meet the current 31 October deadline. Corbyn used all his questions at PMQs to ask Johnson about elements of the bill, including standards for environmental, consumer and workers' rights, and the continued inclusion of Northern Ireland in elements of the EU's customs union. After Johnson incorrectly said there would be 'no checks between Northern Ireland and GB [Great Britain]'ù, Corbyn accused him of having not properly read his own bill. 'The prime minister unlawfully prorogued parliament; he said he would refuse to comply with [the] law; he threw Northern Ireland under a bus; he ripped up protections for workers' rights and environmental protections; lost every vote along the way; and tried to prevent genuine, democratic scrutiny and debate,'the Labour leader said. 'Even worse than that, he's not that familiar with it.'",-0.375,Negative
European leaders expected to grant Brexit delay,0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson will be left waiting for the EU's terms for a further Brexit extension until Friday, with signs of momentum building behind Donald Tusk's plan for a delay up to 31 January. The French government has privately voiced its concerns about taking the pressure off MPs to vote for the deal, which they believe could be ratified in 15 days, but EU sources said the bloc was seeking a 'solution that works for all'and avoids a no deal exit.  Tusk, the president of the European council, told Johnson in a phone call on Wednesday his reasons for 'recommending the EU27 accept the UK request for an extension'ù. The debate among the EU27 is whether to follow Tusk's lead and offer a three-month delay that could be terminated following ratification of the deal, or seek to put pressure on MPs with a shorter extension, an idea raised by France's president, Emmanuel Macron. Tusk has suggested leaders can avoid convening for a summit if they agree to the three months sought in the prime minister's letter of request through a 'written procedure'ù. After a 90-minute meeting of EU ambassadors on Wednesday evening, there appeared to be momentum behind Tusk's strategy. 'All agreed on the need for an extension to avoid a no-deal Brexit'ù, an EU source said. 'The duration of an extension is still being discussed. There was a strong preference to use a written procedure to take the final decision.'One EU diplomat said: 'It felt like we were all going in one direction - towards a flextension to 31 January - but nothing is decided. It needs to work for everyone.'The French ambassador is understood to have insisted that the EU avoid getting dragged in 'domestic politics'in Britain, and questioned whether that would be a consequence of a longer extension. 'If we give it, are we making an election happen?'said a source. Johnson has threatened to push for a general election if the EU agrees to the delay of up to three months that he was instructed to seek on Saturday under the Benn act. France's ambassador had told the EU27 that any delay needed 'to be associated with a justification'ù. 'It needs to be proportionate,'he told the room. He added that there was no 'automaticity'between the request tabled and the EU agreeing to it. Macron has consistently been one the hawks among the EU27 who is wary of giving MPs more time for prevarication. He believes he was right in April when he pushed for a shorter, one-off delay to focus minds in the British parliament on the need to ratify the deal. But the EU source said none of the ambassadors had spoken stridently against a delay to 31 January. 'We need a mechanism to link the length of the delay with a justification. No one spoke about a 15-day extension, as we have heard before from France. It was all very reasonable.'A source said: 'A large number were perfectly happy with the Tusk proposal, others needed some time to reflect. Germany is among those but has been clear that it is fine with the plan.'Monday has been pencilled in as a summit day if the leaders cannot agree and feel the need to debate the issue in person. 'But no one wants that,'a diplomatic source said. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said Brussels was seeking 'clarification'from London. If Johnson is able to agree with Jeremy Corbyn on a new timetable for passing the withdrawal agreement bill, and makes a public request, a delay to 1 December could still be on offer. The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, and the European parliament's president, David Sassoli, backed Tusk on Wednesday. Varadkar told reporters: 'There is no extension agreed. The European Union has not agreed an extension for the UK as yet. President Tusk is currently in the process of consulting the 27 heads of state and government. We spoke this morning. He is recommending that we accept an extension until January 31 that could be terminated early if the House of Commons and House of Lords ratifies an agreement. 'I agreed to that but that's not yet agreed by the 27 and we may have to have an emergency European council over the course of the next few days to discuss it if he can't get consensus. My bags are always packed for Brussels and packed they are again.'Sassoli pointed out there was only one request 'on the table'and he said it deserved the EU27's support. He said: 'I think it is advisable, as requested by Donald Tusk, that the European council should accept this extension. This extension will allow the United Kingdom to clarify its position and the European parliament to exercise its role.'",0.125,Positive
'Disgraceful': Unionists slam minister over Irish Sea checks,0,Neutral,"Unionist MPs have branded the government's approach to Northern Ireland in the Brexit talks 'despicable'and a 'betrayal'ù. In his first appearance before the Northern Ireland affairs select committee, Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, was questioned about plans to require businesses selling or transiting goods from the region to Britain to complete special paperwork in order to trade post-Brexit. Smith said the checks would be minimal and the focus should be on the 'great opportunities'awaiting Northern Ireland.  He said the government would work with businesses to ensure the withdrawal agreement bill would as far as possible allow unfettered trade between Northern Ireland and Britain. But Ian Paisley Jr, the DUP MP for North Antrim, said it was disgraceful to expect any business to complete paperwork for goods being sold in 'our country, not a foreign country'ù. In a tense exchange, he asked Smith where he lived. When Smith told him he lived in North Yorkshire and London, Paisley said: 'If you had to move goods from North Yorkshire to London and have to fill in a form, you'd feel pretty aggrieved about that. We are in the same country. It is disgraceful.'After Boris Johnson told MPs during prime minister's questions that there would be no checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, his spokesman sought to explain that the customs regime would instead be a 'minimal administrative process'ù. Why is a barrier in the Irish Sea being discussed? In agreeing a deal to guarantee the Irish border remains invisible, with no checks fuelling inter-community tensions, the UK is moving the border to the Irish Sea. If all goods entering the island of Ireland are checked before arrival for standards and tariffs, then cross-border trade can continue to flow unimpeded. It will also protect the single market and reduce the chance of suspect goods making their way to the continent via Northern Ireland and the republic. How much trade goes from Great Britain to Northern Ireland? Around 450,000 trailers arrive in Northern Ireland every year, transporting everything from cars to soft cheese to school shirts. Trade and services purchased from Great Britain were valued at £13.4bn according to the latest data, £11bn of that representing goods. About 70% of goods purchased by Northern Irish businesses from Great Britain are destined for the high street and are largely food to Tesco, Sainsbury's and other supermarkets, clothing and white goods, cars and motorbikes. Who will the new Brexit terms impact? All companies moving goods to Northern Ireland. Business representatives believe the big companies such as supermarket chains will be able to put systems in place to deal with any checks but will be looking for government assistance to help smaller businesses. The extent and type of checks will not be clear until the detail of the deal emerges, but essentially they fall into two categories: tariffs and VAT. Excise duties also apply but will not trouble most importers as they generally apply to a limited amount of controlled goods including alcohol, cigarettes and fuel. Customs declarations apply for both exports and imports and, although the trade is domestic, for the purposes of this version of a Brexit backstop, the checks will be made on behalf of the EU. It is concerned about goods from a third country leaking into Ireland and therefore the single market. Will there be a border through the Irish Sea immediately if parliament votes for a deal? No. The discussion over the Irish border is part of Boris Johnson's alternative arrangements to the controversial backstop. It will only be triggered if the UK and EU do not seal their main trade deal before the end of the transition period. Lisa O'Carroll†Brexit correspondent He said: 'The deal explicitly allows the UK to ensure unfettered market access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the UK. We don't intend to carry out checks on these movements of goods. There will be a minimal administrative process provided electronically.'However, Johnson's spokesman declined to say what might happen if companies simply declined to fill in the forms given there was no process to check if they had been completed. The Northern Ireland committee also heard that £15m of taxpayers' money has been spent on Stormont politicians, including members of the legislative assembly (MLAs), since it collapsed in January 2017. MLAs are being paid almost £36,000 a year for not sitting, while the speaker of the chamber is being paid £56,000 a year having sat for one day in almost three years. Sylvia Hermon, an independent unionist MP, said this was 'absolutely outrageous'ù, and Smith admitted it was 'unacceptable'but stopped short of vowing to cut the salaries. He argued it was best to focus on getting Stormont restored because the alternative - direct rule from Westminster - was worse. The DUP had previously accepted that regulatory checks would be needed on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland as a concession designed to obviate the need for checks on the Irish border. The plans for checks on goods going the other way emerged on Monday. Smith tried to offer reassurances but was laughed at when he said the latest chapter in Brexit was a 'healing process'ù. 'This is healing process?'Hermon asked. 'I think you should speak to some of the unionist parties if you think this is a healing process since the deal was brought home last Thursday. There has been considerable disquiet, anger, to put it mildly, amongst the unionist community,'she said. The new Brexit deal is essentially the old†Brexit†deal with a new chapter on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and a few key tweaks to the political declaration. Here is a†link to the full text. The backstop is replaced The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly. Consent Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years. The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a 'backstop'but with a permanent tinge. That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020. Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not. Checks on border, ports and airports Under the deal, the UK and the EU are 'underlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland'ù. Future trade deals The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that 'the United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas'in any future trade talks has been ditched. Customs Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods. No customs duties will be payable on 'personal property'being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use. Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above. A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed. West/east trade The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated. VAT EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland. Single electricity market The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change. Level playing field This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement. Lisa O'Carroll†Brexit correspondent The DUP's Jim Shannon said it was an 'absolutely despicable deal'and the union flag in Northern Ireland was hanging 'a wee bit tattered at the moment'ù. The government's Brexit impact assessment paper that accompanied the publication of the withdrawal agreement bill on Monday night shows that east-west checks would affect 3,517 businesses.

Who will be the world's next superpower? Inside the 25 October Guardian Weekly,0,Neutral,"How important was the American withdrawal in northern Syria? Possibly important enough to signal a new geopolitical epoch, argues Simon Tisdall in this week's cover story. With the US continuing a three-decade retreat, will it be the EU, Russia or China who barges America out of the way to become the planet's 21st-century superpower? Justin Trudeau managed to hold on to power in Canada with a tight victory in Monday night's election. The SNC-Lavalin affair (and the prime minister's blackface habit) looked like they might have sunk the Liberal leader's hopes, but Trudeau held the Tories off and can form a minority administration. Martin Patriquin analyses how he held on. Last week Boris Johnson returned from Brussels with a new Brexit withdrawal bill. Johnson's deal - whose main difference from his predecessor's was the moving of a customs border into the Irish Sea - was quickly rejected by the Conservatives' Northern Irish allies, the DUP. But the prime minister was confident that with the backing of Labour MPs keen to appease Leave-voting constituents, it could pass in parliament. Which was why lawmakers gathered in the House of Commons on 'òSuper' Saturday to debate it. There was just one problem '¶ a proposed amendment by Oliver Letwin (one of the Tories expunged by Johnson for blocking a no-deal exit) that ensured a delay in order for MPs to properly scrutinise the withdrawal bill. Its passing left Johnson scrabbling to find a way to ram the deal through parliament before the 31 October deadline. Heather Stewart, Rowena Mason and Michael Savage make sense of this ongoing parliamentary quagmire. As tens of thousands of anti-Brexiters took to the streets of London last weekend and Hong Kongers continued their pro-democracy protests, many others took to the streets around the world to make their voices heard. In Lebanon, the threat of a tax on WhatsApp proved the spark for a wave of protests against years of graft in Beirut. In Chile, a Santiago metro fare hike provided a similar charge to citizens furious with the country's inequalities. People have also been out in the street in Bolivia (where Evo Morales looks to have won a new term); Ecuador, where Indigenous protesters helped scrap a new fuel tax; and in Catalonia, where the conviction of separatist politicians has led to fury. This week we travel around the world to try to explain some elements of this global wave of protest. Then Nesrine Malik writes about why protests have taken hold once more in the Arab world.  The edition also features an interview with Led By Donkeys, the guerrilla billboard activists who have done more than most in Britain to expose the hypocrisy of the Brexiters. We also feature an extract from a new book by Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy which brings to light dozens of fresh allegations of sexual impropriety by Donald Trump.

Up to 2m UK lambs may 'go to waste' under no-deal Brexit,0.125,Positive,"Sheep farmers are likely to be among the worst hit if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, farmers have said, with estimates showing that as many as 2 million lamb carcasses could go to waste and thousands of farmers could go out of business. The EU is the UK's biggest export market for lamb with no other farming sectors as reliant on that market, making it the most exposed to economic harm if tariffs are imposed. While about 82% of annual beef exports from the UK are sold in the rest of Europe, along with about 78% of the dairy produce not consumed in the UK, 90% of all lamb and other sheep meat exports go to the EU. Estimates by the Country Land and Business Assocation show that if exports remain around the same level as last year, but tariffs are imposed, about 3 million lamb carcasses normally destined for export to the EU would not find a market there. Sarah Hendry, the director general of the CLA, which represents 30,000 UK landowners and rural businesses, said many farmers could be forced to give up their livelihoods if tariffs followed a no-deal Brexit. 'Many farmers are under the most enormous pressure,'she said. 'They fed the nation through lockdown and are readjusting their business for a new life outside the common agricultural policy. Now many face the complete collapse of their market.'She called for the government to put emergency financial support in place for farmers facing potential ruin if there is no deal with the EU. 'If the EU imposes tariffs, many farmers will no longer have customers for their produce, and their businesses could easily collapse,'she said. 'Lamb is one of the most obvious sectors to be hit, and a no-deal could see them affected in spring next year when they go to market.'Some unsold lambs would return to the UK market, where they would depress prices and leave thousands of farmers facing hardship and potentially going out of business. Even if UK lamb consumption increased, and as many unsold carcasses as possible were put in cold storage, the CLA estimates that up to 2 million could go to waste. Farmers will struggle to find a market in the UK for their smaller lambs, in particular, as the whole carcasses are often sold as a delicacy in the rest of Europe, unlike in the UK where cuts from larger animals are preferred. The prospect of steep tariffs being imposed comes after a year in which, for many, lockdown meant the loss of crucial catering and restaurant markets and a scramble to find other ways to get their produce to market. Extreme weather, including the wettest February on record followed by one of the driest springs, has also made for a poor harvest of some staples, with wheat yields plunging by close to a third. Farmers who have diversified into other businesses, such as opening B&Bs, campsites or farm visits, have also had a rollercoaster year. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: 'We are fully committed to agreeing a trade deal with the EU from 1 January 2021. However, as any responsible government would, we are also preparing for the possibility of no deal, and have contingency plans in place to minimise disruption for the farming sectors as much as possible. 'No decisions have been taken on any sector specific interventions, including the sheep sector, post the end of the transition period. Any possible intervention must be dictated by the actual market situation at the time.'",-0.125,Negative
NHS faces drug shortages as Brexit stockpile used in Covid crisis,-0.125,Negative,"Hospitals could face shortages of drugs during the second wave of Covid because some of the medicines stockpiled for Brexit have already been used, NHS bosses have warned. NHS Providers, which represents hospitals in England, said problems associated with Brexit could conjure a 'perfect storm'of problems this winter that could undermine care, including flu, bad weather, workforce shortages, a resurgence of Covid and an epidemic of burnout among staff. 'All of the issues we feared about Brexit remain. None of those have gone away because we are in a pandemic. It's important to remember drug supplies could be compromised'ù, said Saffron Cordery, the organisation's deputy chief executive. 'What we were relying upon in Brexit was a supplies stockpile. I would suggest we have eaten into that stockpile because of Covid. We need to think about what the stockpiles are looking like.'She urged ministers to be open about drug shortages, to help NHS trusts prepare for them. Her remarks come after recent reports of a shortage of remdesivir, an antiviral which has been found to be effective in patients with Covid-19. 'We saw problems with supplies during the first wave of Covid, for example of anaesthesia drugs because of high levels of ventilation. Going into a second surge, securing respiratory drugs is a particular priority'ù, added Cordery. 'The main supply routes for drugs have been through Europe, both in terms of red tape and logistics, as they've come from mainland Europe to the UK through ports. This could all change suddenly with a no-deal Brexit.'The Department of Health and Social Care declined to say if any of the drugs in the Brexit stockpile have already been used. A DHSC spokesperson said : 'We hold a range of stockpiles for a variety of medicines, including crucial treatments used to treat Covid-19 patients to help ensure there is uninterrupted supply. 'As part of our contingency plans we have also asked suppliers to stockpile at least six weeks' worth of medicines, as part of a robust and flexible multi-layered approach which also includes re-routing supply chains and being 'òtrader ready'.'Meanwhile, surgeons have called for some hospital beds to be reserved for patients awaiting planned operations even if a second surge of Covid disrupts normal services again. The call by the Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCSE) comes amid mounting concern about patients who are in the huge backlog of care that built up in the spring, when the NHS suspended many diagnostic and treatment services, especially surgery. 'Patients waiting for operations cannot be left behind indefinitely by the Covid crisis. Many are in serious pain, with their conditions deteriorating while they are on the list'ù, said Prof Neil Mortensen, the college's president. 'As the virus becomes more prevalent again there is a real risk of a tsunami of cancelled operations unless surgical beds are funded and protected. That means building up theatre capacity and designating beds exclusively for those who need an operation'ù, he added. The college said hospitals had not begun providing 80% of normal services by the end of September, despite indication from NHS England that they should. And on Monday, David Nicholson, the chief executive of NHS England until 2014, warned in the Health Service Journal  that it would take hospitals years to get back to undertaking pre-pandemic numbers of operations. An RCSE survey of almost 1,000 surgeons found that only one in seven (14%) can treat the same number of patients as before the coronavirus crisis hit, with the maximum having fallen from four in a session to two or three, because of the need for social distancing, regular cleaning of operating theatres and the time it takes staff to put on personal protective equipment and take it off again.

"Brexit: Ireland needs to press for reunification vote, says Sinn FÈin",0.125,Positive,"Ireland cannot trust an 'erratic'and 'dangerous'Boris Johnson on Brexit and needs to start pressuring Downing Street for a referendum on Irish unification, according to Mary Lou McDonald, the leader of Sinn FÈin. Johnson has forfeited credibility by unpicking the withdrawal agreement and cannot be believed when he says he wants a trade deal, said McDonald. 'He's the prime minister and perfidious Albion just got perfidiouser, if there's such a word.'If Britain did not 'honour a bargain fairly struck'it would face a backlash from Ireland's allies in the EU and US, where congressional leaders could sink Downing Street's hopes of a US trade deal, said McDonald. 'If there is damage in Ireland, if there's a hardening of the border - well, then all bets are off.'The Sinn FÈin leader spoke to the Guardian after an opinion poll showed her opposition party to be the most popular in Ireland, with support at 32%. Recent blunders by the Fianna F√°il-led coalition government have put a question mark over its longevity and bolstered McDonald's image as a taoiseach-in-waiting. A government led by Sinn FÈin would jolt British-Irish relations. A mouthpiece for the IRA during the Troubles, it has become a mainstream, leftwing party that appeals to voters in the south of Ireland on bread-and-butter issues, especially health and housing. However, McDonald, 51, stressed its enduring determination to unite Ireland. 'In my lifetime? Absolutely. All of the signposts, all of the markers, point in the direction of reunification,'she said. By next year, the centenary of Northern Ireland's creation, Catholics are expected to outnumber Protestants for the first time, a seismic demographic shift that comes just as Brexit has prompted some unionists to question the region's position in the UK. 'The electoral majority for unionism is now gone, politics on this island has changed in ways that are profound,'said McDonald, a Trinity College graduate from Dublin who succeeded Gerry Adams as party leader in 2018. However, Northern Ireland voters are not flocking to the republican banner. In the December general election Sinn FÈin's overall vote in the north fell by 6.7 percentage points. The fastest-growing bloc is the so-called non-aligned - voters who shun traditional orange/green labels. Opinion polls suggest they tilt towards the status quo: staying in the UK. Anthony McIntyre, a former Belfast IRA member and commentator, said: 'No provisional IRA volunteer who fought the provo war will see a united Ireland.'The NHS and other benefits of the UK would swing the result, he predicted. 'People who are only nominally nationalist will vote for the union. That's where the veto lies.'McDonald said the promise of a new, progressive, inclusive Ireland, with an NHS-style health service, would win over enough voters. Under the Good Friday agreement, the UK's Northern Ireland secretary must call a referendum when it appears likely that most people would vote in favour of a united Ireland. However, McDonald said ministers refused to spell out the exact conditions that would trigger a vote. 'I wouldn't like anybody in the British system to imagine that they hold a trump card that says 'òwe will forever avoid or defer a referendum in Ireland'. They don't have that right.'She said a united Ireland must offer unionists 'the kinds of protections and assurances that they need'- for instance, a possible continued role for the Stormont assembly. She ruled out moving the capital from Dublin. Asked whether the IRA violence during the Troubles was justified, McDonald said: 'I think it was inevitable.'Partition and discrimination created a 'toxic'context that 'framed'attitudes and choices, she said. Pressed again on whether violence was justified, she said she was a child for much of the campaign. 'I am certainly not going to be the person accountable for things that happened in 1973. I think that's an extraordinary thing to ask of me.'She said there would never be an agreed narrative on the Troubles. 'I think it's foolish to pursue it '¶ you're not going to bridge that difference.'History could not be undone, she said. 'The past is the past. I can't rewrite it.'She rejected allegations that the IRA army council still existed and influenced party policy. 'The IRA is gone, the conflict is over,'she said.  There was a hint of misogyny in the claims that shadowy men directed her, said McDonald. 'It seems there are some people who find it hard to grasp that a woman from Dublin could be the leader of Sinn FÈin, but I am.'A severe Covid-19 infection in April - McDonald was floored and got pleurisy before recovering - led to a little bright spot in British-Irish relations. 'Prince Charles sent me a letter,'she said, 'which I thought was really nice.'",-1.25,Negative
Brexit: warnings for care sector in pandemic as freedom of movement ends,-0.625,Negative,"The end of freedom of movement after Brexit will increase pressure on the social care sector in the midst of a pandemic unless ministers make jobs more attractive to UK workers by increasing salaries, government advisers have said. The migration advisory committee (Mac) warned of the 'stark consequences'of low wages in social care with most frontline roles ineligible for the post-Brexit skilled worker immigration route or on the official list for job shortages in the UK. Senior care workers and nursing assistants are among healthcare roles that can be added to the shortage occupation list to relieve pressure when freedom of movements ends on 1 January, the committee said in a report. But many of the roles in social care do not qualify and the advisers said 'it therefore remains crucial that the government implements a more sustainable and generous funding model'ù. 'The risks of this not happening in a timely manner are stark,'the report reads. 'If that does not occur, or occurs with substantial delay, we would expect the end of freedom of movement to increase the pressure on the social care sector, something that would be particularly difficult to understand at a time when so many care occupations are central to the Covid-19 pandemic frontline response.'The vulnerable state of the UK care sector was brought into stark focus by thecoronavirus pandemic with 18,000 care home residents dying from confirmed or suspected Covid-19 in UK care facilities during the first wave of the outbreak. Senior care workers constitute only about 10% of the UK social care workforce, said the chair of Mac, Prof Brian Bell, and that adding the role to the shortage occupation list would have only a small impact on the more than 100,000 vacancies in the UK. The committee's call for evidence heard that employers in the sector felt strongly that the worth of their staff was not recognised. Bell said: 'There needs to be a better funding model for social care that makes work in that sector better rewarded, and that's the right way not only to attract resident workers and not to have to rely on migrants but also to deal with the turnover of the staff which is very high. 'But part of that is because workers don't feel they're valued appropriately. We think the way you value workers is you pay them better.'Bell said he hoped the Department of Health and Social Care would soon come forward with proposals for improving the salaries for care workers. He added that care workers should be paid 'significantly higher'than £10 an hour. The national living wage for workers aged 25 or over is £8.72. A median full-time salary for a care worker is £19,100, the Mac report said, which is below the minimum shortage occupation list salary threshold of £20,480. The committee said there was potential for a rise in labour supply to the care sector as a result of job losses elsewhere due to the impact of Covid-19, but cautioned that 'this cannot be predicted with any certainty'ù. Mac said other occupations that should be added to the UK-wide list include butchers, bricklayers and welders, 'where there is clear evidence of staff and skills shortages which could be filled by overseas workers'ù. A government spokesperson said: 'The Migration Advisory Committee has again been very clear that immigration is not the solution to addressing staffing levels in the social care sector. 'We're helping the sector in a number of ways, including £1.5bn more funding for adults and children's social care in 2020-21 and a national recruitment scheme.'",0.75,Positive
"Confidence in UK's global role plunges after Brexit, poll finds",-0.375,Negative,"Belief that Britain is a force for good in the world has plunged in the last 18 months, a national poll has found, with under half of the UK now convinced of the country's positive impact. As negotiations on the UK's future relationship enter a key week in Brussels and with the country set to leave the EU's single market and customs union at the end of the year, a poll by Ipsos Mori suggests there is a lack of confidence in Britain's global role. Just under half of Britons (49%) believe that Britain is a force for good in the world, down 10 points from April 2019. While 41% of Britons say the UK should punch above its weight in world affairs, the proportion who believe Britain should stop pretending it is an important power is up five points from last year to 38%. The public are still more likely to say that Britain should increase its influence around the world than reduce it - by 36% to 16%. The polling was commissioned by the EU-UK forum, a new organisation established in Brussels in an attempt to promote a close relationship between Britain and the bloc in the coming years. The negotiations over a trade and security deal are due to resume in Brussels on Tuesday, with UK officials talking up the prospects of agreement. EU sources are more cautious, warning that the compromises necessary are yet to be made. Relations have been made more difficult following Boris Johnson's decision to legislate to allow the UK to unilaterally rewrite the terms of the withdrawal agreement in what ministers have admitted is a breach of international law. Such was the outrage over the government's move that the Democrat contender for US president, Joe Biden, warned that he would block a UK-US trade deal if the British government put at risk the Good Friday agreement by breaking with the arrangements agreed on Northern Ireland in the withdrawal agreement. Despite the row over the internal market bill, in which the threat to breach the agreement was made, optimism has grown in recent days that a deal on a future relationship can be struck. The internal market bill aims to enforce compatible rules and regulations regarding trade in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some rules, for example around food safety or air quality,† which were formerly set by EU agreements, will now be controlled by the devolved administrations or Westminster. The internal market bill insists that devolved administrations† have to accept goods and services from all the nations of the UK - even if their standards differ locally. This, says the government, is in part to ensure international traders have access to the UK as a whole, confident that standards and rules are consistent. The Scottish government has criticised it as a Westminster ""power grab"", and the Welsh government has expressed fears it will lead to a race to the bottom. If one of the countries that makes up the UK lowers their standards, over the importation of chlorinated chicken, for example, the other three nations will have to accept chlorinated chicken too. It has become even more controversial because one of its main aims is to empower ministers to pass regulations even if they are contrary to the withdrawal agreement reached with the EU under the Northern Ireland protocol. The text does not disguise its intention, stating that powers contained in the bill 'have effect notwithstanding any relevant international or domestic law with which they may be incompatible or inconsistent"". The bill passed its first hurdle in parliament by 77 votes, despite a rebellion by some Tory MPs. Martin Belam and Owen Bowcott A summit of EU leaders on 15 October is being seen by both sides as a crunch point by which time it will be clear whether common ground can be found on the outstanding issues. The two sides have struggled to find a mutually acceptable solution to the level of access that European fleets will have to British fishing waters or how to maintain a 'level playing field'for businesses in which neither side can unfairly lower production standards or prop up ailing companies through state aid subsidies. But there is a growing belief in Westminster that the prime minister is not willing to face a no-deal exit from the transition period at a time when the country is struggling to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. According to the Ipsos Mori poll, Europe remains Britain's most important relationship in the world for four in 10 of the public, with double the number of people choosing the EU over either the Commonwealth or the US. Four in five think maintaining a close relationship with the EU is important despite Brexit, although only 39% of people now think that is likely, down 13 points since April 2019. Two in five (40%) believe the top priority for Britain's relationship with the EU is striking a trade agreement, with one in five saying it is to prevent and detect crime and terrorism, coordinate responses to the Covid-19 pandemic, or deal with global migration. Paul Adamson, chairman of the EU-UK forum, said: 'The polling shows that the vast majority of people think it is important for the UK to keep a close relationship with the EU despite Brexit, and only a minority wants to see the UK stepping back from the global stage. 'Since Brexit is a process - not a final destination - the EU-UK Forum is being launched to facilitate and nurture constructive and informed dialogue between the UK and the EU.'Ipsos Mori interviewed a sample of 1,068 British adults aged 16-75 between 10 and 14 September.

The majority of people in Kent voted leave - but not to leave the UK,0.125,Positive,"It was only a matter of time. Trump's rallying cry of 'build a wall'- so succinct, so quotable - has made it across the pond. Now we can build our own wall. In Kent. Come January, we'll triumphantly take back control of our borders - something Michael Gove has wholeheartedly embraced, announcing this week that truckers will need a 'Kent access permit'to get into the county from 1 January. So, basically a passport, then. The de-facto border has been posed as the answer to the predicted chaos, or in official parlance the 'reasonable worst-case scenario'ù, when the UK departs from the single market next year - including queues of up to 7,000 lorries in Kent. That's around 100 miles of traffic, and two-day delays on both sides of the Channel - and not just for hauliers. Forget about jumping on the Eurostar and grabbing lunch at Brasserie Bellanger (pandemic permitting). According to a report drawn up by the border and protocol delivery group, passengers could also be forced to wait an extra two hours for Eurostar trains. Naturally, Gove cares deeply about the impact on the people of Kent, saying the system will be implemented through ''¶ policing, ANPR cameras and other means, [and] we will do our very best to ensure that '¶ constituents [in Kent] are not inconvenienced'ù. But even the Road Haulage Association is scratching its head about what those 'other means'could possibly be, let alone the police work needed for enforcement. Rosie Duffield, MP for Canterbury - a constituency that also encompasses Whitstable, where I live - is the only opposition MP in Kent's 17 constituencies. Gove once informed her he loves Whitstable oysters. 'Well, save them, then!'said Duffield in exasperation. As things stand, Whitstable's most famous export could be doomed to rot in the back of delayed trucks. Duffield is 'apoplectic'about the proposed permits and the havoc they will cause, particularly for smaller, independent businesses, and on residents' daily lives - the impact of increased traffic on hospital journeys is a particular worry. For the past three years, she says, Kent MPs have had their concerns dismissed. And then there's the air pollution - and tarmac. 'Imagine walking your children to school past back to back lorries,'she says. Hundreds of them will need places to park. Already, a 'Brexit lorry park'is planned in Ashford, with enough space for 2,000 trucks. 'We're supposed to be the garden of England, but we're going to be the car park of England,'says Duffield. There's a certain irony in the fact 59% of people in Kent voted to leave at the 2016 referendum. As one Twitter user put it: 'Kent voted heavily in favour of leaving the EU and now it's basically a French car park. Tremendous.'I moved to live by the sea in Whitstable 13 years ago, after spending 16 years in the capital. If I missed aspects of London - the art galleries, the ramen at Nanban - I could simply hop on a train and go back, I reasoned. For a while I commuted, enjoying my sophisticated double life - except the actual commuting. All that travelling just so I could go to Borough Market at lunchtime and pay a tenner for a falafel? No thanks. I work from home now, or, technically, from a small, shared space in a local social enterprise. I love where I live, mostly - but there's a reason some locals call the area 'Whitstabubble'ù. Kent is a British monoculture, and divisions between 'born-and-bred'locals and incomers are rife; a huge proportion of houses in Whitstable, for example, are second homes or holiday lets that are pricing locals out of their own town. On hearing Gove's plans for a Kent border, my first thought was, doesn't Kent already have one, between rich and poor, remain and leave? Despite Margate's reputation as 'Shoreditch-on-Sea'ù, Thanet has among the highest rates of child poverty in south-east England. Down the road in Whitstable, you can't get to the beach on a sunny day thanks to crowds of visitors getting their fix of overpriced seafood. Hidden out of sight of our lovely cafes, bijou art galleries, craft-beer bars and trendy bakeries are areas of poverty and deprivation. The rate of reported hate crime in Kent has quadrupled since 2013-14; and Whitstable, remember, was where Nigel Farage rolled up to help local fishermen burn an effigy of Theresa May in protest at the Brexit negotiations in 2018. Perhaps it's time for Kent to pull together and embrace its new fate as an island inside the mainland. Thanet used to be cut off from the country. You can tell - it's still strangely eerie and flat. And then there's the Isle of Sheppy - an actual island, home to prisons, caravan parks and a charming cabin, featured on this website (and subsequently booked up until 2089). This, people of Kent, is our future. Build a wall. Implement a border. Separate Kent from the mainland, float it out to sea. It's all good. We'll be fine.

"Johnson is struggling with the politics of Covid, but it's dangerous to write him off",-0.75,Negative,"Optimism is essential in politics. But the borderline between optimism and wishful thinking is easily overstepped. In one of my earliest jobs I interviewed London Labour party candidates and activists during the 1983 general election. One after another they said with passionate sincerity that Labour would win by 50 seats, and proceeded to lay out the compelling reasons why this was so. The following week the Conservatives won the election by nearly 150. Plenty of those who frequent the palace of wishful thinking today have opined with similar certainty recently that Boris Johnson is now dead in the water. They have said he is not happy, that he is still ill, that he realises he is not up to the job, that he can't cope with Covid. The Conservative party is said to be in ferment, Tory backbenchers are apparently unbiddable, and the public sees that it bought a political turkey last December. By spring, therefore, Johnson will be gone, to be replaced by Michael Gove, Rishi Sunak or some other freshly fashionable alternative. This is not a version of the next few months that can be altogether ruled out. It could possibly happen. In that respect, it is less fantastical than the Labour belief in 1983 that Michael Foot was about to unseat Margaret Thatcher. After all, the reports about Johnson's downbeat mood appear true, as far as they go. He is manifestly struggling with the politics of the pandemic. The Tory party at Westminster is irritable about new lockdown measures, the law-breaking powers in the internal market bill and the proposed bonfire of planning regulations. Johnson's faults are also much more obvious now. Sasha Swire, in her newly published diaries, that are without doubt the political must-read of the autumn, calls Johnson 'an island, a spinning, mad island. He gets by, by having very good people to do the work, and the detail.'But that indulgent judgment looks out of date amid the renewed pandemic, and after Barnard Castle in particular. Swire's August 2019 observation that 'you can't quite believe he is there. In that job! But he is, and it's going to be a hell of a ride'now sounds much more ominous. It is also true, once you get beyond the issue of Brexit, that there is not much intellectual or ideological coherence in the Johnson government or the Johnson Tory party. The 2019 election united the Conservatives about Brexit. The issue gave the shires and the post-industrial towns something in common. But they are not united about much else. There are few shared instincts. Attitudes to taxation and the public finances, for instance, vary wildly, as Sunak is discovering as he prepares a mightily difficult spending review. Approaches to Covid are equally hard to reconcile in a party where some regard most government measures as busy-bodying nonsense. The result is that attempting to grasp the political and intellectual geography of the Conservative party today is a bit like trying to master the map of late medieval Germany, in which all those little princedoms and sleepy bishoprics where nothing ever happens coexisted alongside extremely prosperous city states and a few pockets of Anabaptist fanaticism. In historical terms, though, the sheer oddity and newness of the current Conservative coalition can hardly be overstated. Whether in the long term this proves to be a strength or a weakness is in Johnson's hands. However, it is clear that things could go very badly wrong for the government over the next year, especially on Covid and, above all, the economy. And if Johnson is not enjoying the job then another of Swire's observations about him would come more into play. 'He is curiously vulnerable and longs to be loved, and cannot understand it when he is not.'That is the reason why a messy political divorce between the party and Johnson cannot be entirely ruled out. And yet, writing Johnson off is comfort zone copy, easy to compose and a pleasure for many to read. But it risks underestimating him and his party. Support for the Conservatives has been robust, in spite of the mishandling of the pandemic. There is a different, obviously less exciting, but actually rather more plausible way of looking at the possibilities of the coming months. In this version of the winter of 2020-21, Johnson struggles through, doing just enough to maintain and perhaps revive confidence in his leadership and government, with the result that he again gets lucky. A government minister put some meat on the bones of this argument for me this week. Just suppose, he began, that the UK gets a post-Brexit deal with the European Union. It is hard-wired into some thinking that Johnson does not want a deal. Yet both the UK and the EU have a significant interest in such an outcome, whatever the Tory party's leavers and their press backers say. The internal market bill, for all its many objectionable provocations, does not rule a deal out. The deal would happen at the last possible moment, and it would disappoint remain and leave critics alike. But it would also mean that Brexit ceased to be an issue, and it would mean that Johnson would have a victory. Suppose, next, something else that is also uncertain but not improbable. Imagine that the Covid measures that were introduced this week, and other measures that will inevitably follow, are in fact gradually effective. Opinion polling suggests there is less Covid fatigue in the country than Johnson assumed in the summer. If the public accepts that this is a long haul, that Johnson is now getting back on the right track and, crucially, if Rishi Sunak makes the long haul less cruel for businesses and employees, the politics of the pandemic could look different in the spring - both to the public and to the Tory party itself. Labour's modest rebuilding fits in here. Keir Starmer is polling ahead of Johnson. But Labour is mostly polling behind the Conservatives. That may change, perhaps soon. Yet Starmer was right to stress this week that Labour still has a long road ahead. It has not yet broken through. The new Tory MPs who sit in former Labour seats are a powerful lobby group within the party. Many of the old 'our people'Tory MPs are uncomfortable with demands for more big government. But the new MPs have Johnson's ear, and Sunak's too. In the unprecedented politics of the Covid and Brexit eras, only a fool would rule out the possibility that Johnson's Tory party could crumple under the impact of events. These are volatile times. Yet it is at least as possible, and probably more, that the British politics which emerges from the tests of the coming months could look pretty familiar. This may be a dire government led by a shabby prime minister. But don't deceive yourself into thinking they are hanging on by the fingernails, because right now they are not.

Politicians like to posture about Northern Ireland. But no one really cares about us,0.625,Positive,"Everybody has an opinion on Northern Ireland. It's one of the many drawbacks of being from this part of the world. We're a talking point for other people, an easily weaponised subject to be used and cast aside for ulterior motives. Brexit has allowed this to play out on the international stage. We've become a proxy in a culture war. The main actors care little for Northern Ireland or the people who live here. On 20 January 2020, in a pre-Covid world, the Northern Ireland assembly voted to withhold consent for the withdrawal agreement. The agreement, hailed as a triumph by the British government and the European Union, was rejected by every party in the assembly. The assembly members had different reasons for voting against the agreement and different agendas, but on this issue they were united. In December of 2019, every Northern Ireland MP sitting in the Westminster parliament had voted against the deal. Despite this, the EU and the British government weren't very concerned. It turns out that it doesn't matter if we don't like the withdrawal agreement. As Northern Ireland picked up the pieces of Brexit, the world moved on. You can imagine the surprise when Boris Johnson announced his intention to mitigate the Northern Ireland protocol by passing the internal market bill. The prime minister appears to have taken his 'oven ready'deal out of the bin and inspected it for the first time. He says he's now acting to protect the Good Friday agreement and prevent a border down the Irish Sea. But, although it breaks international law, the internal market bill doesn't stop a sea border. The Good Friday agreement says nothing about a customs border down the Irish Sea or, indeed, a customs border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Johnson, who barely considered Northern Ireland during the Brexit campaign, is hardly a bannerman for our peace process. While feigning concern about a sea border he appears willing to risk a hard border on the island of Ireland. He is playing one community off against the other while cosplaying as a unionist. With the UK set to breach its international obligations, the European Union has responded by saying that it is the one protecting the Good Friday agreement. The fact that the assembly didn't consent to the withdrawal agreement, that people in Northern Ireland have serious issues with it, seems lost on the commission as it pats itself on the back. The EU can hardly claim to be an impartial broker. Johnson's move has led to interventions from the US presidential candidate Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and four influential US congressmen. All of them believe the internal market bill threatens the Good Friday agreement. Pelosi and Biden have both said that the British government won't get a US trade deal if it threatens the peace process. While Biden and Pelosi's interventions should make the prime minister consider the implications of his actions, they aren't helpful. In appearing to dismiss concerns about a sea border, Biden is angering unionists. It hasn't helped that he's endorsed a letter signed by congressman Peter King, a man with strong Irish republican sympathies. Nigel Farage, along with other rightwingers, has accused the presidential candidate of anti-Britishness. Why Biden is being anti-British for talking about protecting the Good Friday agreement, which includes a treaty between the UK and Ireland, is anybody's guess. This is culture war stuff, boring and useless when it comes to the matter at hand. Northern Ireland is being used to project jingoistic nonsense. Biden, like Trump and every other US president, has a single priority: the United States. Whoever is sitting in the Oval Office in January next year will want a trade deal that advances US interests. The NHS, our food market and workers' rights will all be up for grabs. Just because Biden is concerned about the Good Friday agreement doesn't mean he's good for Northern Ireland. As for the prime minister, his newfound concern for Northern Ireland is laughable. We are being dangled and used as bait so the British government can secure concessions from the EU. When the government gets what it wants, it, and the European Union, will leave Northern Ireland to deal with the mess of the withdrawal agreement. The Good Friday agreement succeeded because its architects understood that Northern Ireland could only move forward by addressing the concerns of both communities. The agreement created an imperfect peace but, at its heart, it was about building consensus. All of that seems lost in the noise created by Johnson, Biden, Farage and the EU. Northern Ireland was at the heart of Brexit, exposing its contradictions and throwing already divided communities down on either side of the debate. If people truly want to protect and honour the Good Friday agreement, they could start by putting self-interest aside. Northern Ireland deserves a future where both communities feel respected and secure. Sarah Creighton is a lawyer, writer and political commentator from Northern Ireland ",-0.875,Negative
"Johnson is tested on Covid and Brexit, his specialist subjects of ignorance",0.625,Positive,"It's no great secret that Boris Johnson has problems with women. And not just his wives, girlfriends and IT advisers. So going in to prime minister's questions to face Angela Rayner - a working-class former care worker and the type of woman he has probably never previously encountered - who was standing in for the self-isolating Keir Starmer, Johnson's sole objective was to try to avoid being his normal aggressive, condescending, patronising self. And though he did occasionally peer across the dispatch box, as if to check whether Rayner was from another planet, he did just about hold it together. There were no jokes or insults. This was about as close to polite as Boris can manage. Rayner appeared understandably nervous at first - this was her first outing at PMQs - but quickly got into her stride with a story about a man called Keir who couldn't get to work that morning, before reminding Boris that she had once worked in the care sector and did he have a clue what the average wage for someone working in that profession was? He didn't, but wasn't bothered. He was just focused on trying not to sound too rude. Which is pretty much the way the rest of the session played out. Rayner would ask some telling questions about the government's failures to meet either its own - or even adequate - coronavirus testing targets, and Boris would just waffle along with as much ersatz charm as he could manage. It didn't matter if he didn't know the answer or came out with some figures that even he knew were bullshit; the only strategy in play was to sound as if he was treating Rayner as an equal. Rayner did get in some good lines about driving to Durham for a Covid test and the government prioritising grouse shooting - Johnson's self-inflicted wound that he was acting on the people's priorities raised the odd groan from his own benches - but Boris was long past caring. The Labour deputy leader might have got the better of the exchanges, but he had lasted the 15 minutes without portraying himself as too much of an unreconstructed, entitled dinosaur. Which, given the circumstances, just about counted as a draw. Far more revealing - as in, revealing of just how little command of the detail the prime minister actually has - was his appearance before the liaison committee, the supergroup of select committee chairs, later in the afternoon. Then the committee does have the advantage of being able to carry on asking questions until Johnson's cluelessness is exposed. It was also unfortunate for Boris that two of the main areas under examination were his specialist subjects of ignorance: the coronavirus and Brexit. The science committee chair, Greg Clark, got things under way by observing that the government's Covid testing systems were - to put it kindly - a bit of a mess. Boris merely fidgeted and rubbed his bloodshot eyes, searching for inspiration. We're definitely going to be testing 500,000 per day by the end of October. Clark sighed. At that time of year there were normally 500,000 people each day displaying symptoms consistent with Covid anyway, so that really wasn't going to be enough to begin to deal with the problem. Johnson tugged his hair and suggested it would be helpful if only those who definitely had the virus should ask for a test. Moments later, he denied to Meg Hillier having any knowledge of ever promising Operation Moonshot that would deliver 10m tests a day that delivered results in just 20 minutes. Hold that thought. We have a prime minister who can't remember having committed his government to spending £100bn live on TV a week earlier. Sometimes it's a wonder he can get himself dressed in the morning. That, though, turned out to be Boris at his most coherent. For the rest of the session he looked like an overgrown schoolkid who had been put on the naughty step for failure to deliver his homework. When was there going to be a public inquiry? Never, he hoped. Though there might be a 'lessons learned'inquiry some time in the future whose conclusion would be to never hold a public inquiry. Labour's Catherine McKinnell then asked him about a report he clearly didn't know existed and followed up by suggesting that if it was OK for the government to break the law in limited and specific ways, then why couldn't members of the public choose which laws they wanted to break in specific and limited ways. Boris again had no answer, other than to claim there had always been one rule for him and another for everyone else. Things turned uglier still when the subject moved on to Brexit. Johnson just smirked when asked why he was choosing to break international law rather than abide by the arbitration procedures he himself had negotiated in the withdrawal agreement. When pushed further, he hinted that he hadn't realised that leaving the EU meant leaving the EU in its entirety, rather than being able to pick and choose the bits we fancied keeping. This, Johnson claimed, was proof that the EU had not been negotiating in good faith. Yet again, satire proved to be a straightforward transcription service. Not least because Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, had only that morning told the select committee that the EU had acted reasonably throughout. Nor could Boris say who was right: the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, who claimed the internal markets bill only broke the law if implemented, or Brandon Lewis, who said it did so under any circumstances. 'I refer you to the advice of the attorney general,'Johnson shrugged. When you're relying on the synaptically challenged Suella Braverman - whom you wouldn't employ to fight a parking ticket - for answers, then you know you're fighting a lost cause. The session ended in confusion, with the prime minister unable to say whether Lord Keen, the Tory advocate general for Scotland, had resigned after being corrected by the Northern Ireland secretary over his remarks on law breaking in parliament. Minutes later, it was announced that Keen had indeed resigned. Though whether the Tories would be able to get a replacement was another matter, as anyone who agreed to take the job would be immediately disbarred for being willing to break the law. As so often, the line between farce and tragedy was becoming increasingly blurred. ",-1.75,Negative
Tory rebellion widens over Boris Johnson's bill to override Brexit deal,0.125,Positive,"Downing Street is facing a showdown with Conservative backbench rebels as criticism over its plans to break international law with a controversial bill that could override parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement grew louder on Sunday. It is understood that opposition among the party is growing, with dozens of Tory MPs expected to support a key amendment to the internal market bill that would give parliament a crucial veto of any changes to the agreement. MPs will have an opportunity to air their opposition during a second reading and debate of the bill on Monday, when it will also be put to a vote before passing to committee stage. A number of Tory MPs intend to abstain in Monday's vote, with up to 30 expected to back the amendment tabled by Sir Bob Neill, the chair of the justice select committee, next week. Geoffrey Cox, Boris Johnson's former attorney general, broke cover on Sunday evening to say he could not support the bill, describing the government's plan as 'unconscionable'ù. The shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, confirmed that Labour would also vote against the bill in its current form. Neill, who will be abstaining on Monday, told the Guardian: 'I've had some very positive support from fellow Conservative MPs, significantly from both people who supported Brexit, as well as remainers. I'm confident that support is growing.'His comments come as the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, said he would resign if the law was 'broken in a way that I find unacceptable'but stressed that 'we are not at that stage'ù. He told BBC One's the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the legislation was a 'break the glass in emergency provision if we need it'ù. The internal market bill aims to enforce compatible rules and regulations regarding trade in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some rules, for example around food safety or air quality,† which were formerly set by EU agreements, will now be controlled by the devolved administrations or Westminster. The internal market bill insists that devolved administrations† have to accept goods and services from all the nations of the UK - even if their standards differ locally. This, says the government, is in part to ensure international traders have access to the UK as a whole, confident that standards and rules are consistent. The Scottish government has criticised it as a Westminster ""power grab"", and the Welsh government has expressed fears it will lead to a race to the bottom. If one of the countries that makes up the UK lowers their standards, over the importation of chlorinated chicken, for example, the other three nations will have to accept chlorinated chicken too. It has become even more controversial because one of its main aims is to empower ministers to pass regulations even if they are contrary to the withdrawal agreement reached with the EU under the Northern Ireland protocol. The text does not disguise its intention, stating that powers contained in the bill 'have effect notwithstanding any relevant international or domestic law with which they may be incompatible or inconsistent"". The bill passed its first hurdle in parliament by 77 votes, despite a rebellion by some Tory MPs. Martin Belam and Owen Bowcott Lord Thomas, the lord chief justice of England and Wales from 2013 to 2017, said he did not accept Buckland's argument and in effect called on him to consider his position. Referencing the resignation of Jonathan Jones, the head of the government's legal department, he told BBC Radio on Sunday: 'Obviously Sir Jonathan felt that the situation was such that he felt he could not continue. I do not see the lord chancellor [Buckland] being in any different position.'Former prime ministers Sir John Major and Tony Blair also criticised the prime minister's threat to break international law over the weekend. In a joint article written for the Sunday Times, the pair urged MPs to reject the legislation, saying it imperiled the Irish peace process, trade negotiations and the UK's integrity. Writing in the Times on Monday, Cox said: 'When the Queen's minister gives his word, on her behalf, it should be axiomatic that he will keep it, even if the consequences are unpalatable.'Meanwhile, a new war of words broke out on Twitter between Downing Street's chief negotiator, David Frost, and his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, over the Northern Ireland protocol, under which it would continue to enforce EU customs and follow product standards rules to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Frost claimed the EU had made it clear there is no guarantee it will add Britain to its list of approved third countries for food imports. But Barnier said it needed details from the UK on its future health standards for food, plant and animal origin products for export, known as sanitary and phytosanitary standards. Neill said his amendment would not reach parliament until the second week of debates but would 'allow time for momentum to grow,'adding: 'Ministers will be under pressure to explain what their opposition is to a parliamentary lock. The amendment doesn't actually remove these clauses from the bill. Some people will say: 'òYou ought to go further and take them out completely.' But this is done in the spirit of compromise if the government really needs to use them in an emergency. 'What you can do is have the provision in the bill but you wouldn't actually activate it until the House of Commons, on a minister's motion, specifically authorised those clauses to come into effect by voting for it.'In an extraordinary scene in the Commons last week, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, admitted that the proposed bill 'does break international law in a very specific and limited way'ù. The bill, which would give ministers powers to 'disapply'part of the deal signed by Johnson last year, has infuriated Brussels. Writing for the Telegraph on Saturday, Johnson claimed that he had been anxious in recent weeks as negotiators believed there was a 'serious misunderstanding'about the terms of the withdrawal agreement. He wrote: 'We are now hearing that, unless we agree to the EU's terms, the EU will use an extreme interpretation of the Northern Ireland protocol to impose a full-scale trade border down the Irish Sea.'Johnson described the internal market bill as a 'legal safety net'to 'protect the free flow of goods and services between NI and the rest of the UK'ù. After its expected passage through its second reading on Monday, the bill will come before the committee stage on Tuesday and Wednesday but, because of scheduling, Neill's amendment is unlikely to be voted on in parliament until next week, when there will be a further two days of debate. The opposition is unlikely to overcome the government's 80-seat majority but provides another headache for Downing Street amid growing discontent among Conservative MPs following a series of high-profile U-turns this year over Covid-19 policy decisions. Former Tory leaders Theresa May and Sir Michael Howard have spoken out against the bill. Neill said he hoped other parties might also support his amendment. Reeves said Labour 'would need to look at the detail'of Neill's amendment before deciding to back it, and that it would be tabling amendments of its own. The Tory MP Tobias Ellwood, chair of the defence select committee, and one of the Conservatives backing Neill's amendment and abstaining on Monday's vote, said: 'This isn't about a rebellion, this is about advancing the strategies to ensure we don't lose sight of who we are and what we stand for and that is absolutely critical in these dangerous and changing times. 'Britain is one of the founding fathers of modern democracy and international law and at a time when the rules-based order is eroding, we should be seen to defend it rather than undermine it.'The veteran Conservative MP Sir Roger Gale said he would be both voting against the internal market bill and supporting Neill's amendment. 'As far as I'm concerned, there is an international agreement that we signed up to freely and willingly and which we must now honour. End of story,'he said. Meanwhile, there were new calls from Brussels and EU capitals on Sunday for the internal market bill to be dropped. After a phone call with Ireland's taoiseach, Miche√°l Martin, the president of the European council, Charles Michel, tweeted: 'Withdrawal agreement to be fully implemented, ensure peace and stability in Ireland and preserve the integrity of single market. Time for UK government to take its responsibilities. International credibility of UK signature at stake.'France's EU affairs minister, Cl√©ment Beaune, said it would be inconceivable for London to adopt a bill that would partly contradict the agreement ratifying its divorce from the EU.

The Observer view on Boris Johnson's lamentable summer,-1,Negative,"Boris Johnson has succeeded in achieving something no other sitting prime minister has done to date: he has made himself the target of excoriating criticism from not one or two, but three former leaders of his party, two of them also former prime ministers. It is an extraordinary indictment of his incompetence and his failure to take the business of governing this country seriously. What prompted this was the unprecedented admission by one of his ministers that the government planned to break international law. In a Commons debate about the government's internal market bill, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, confirmed that in giving ministers the power to unilaterally overturn parts of the EU withdrawal agreement, the bill contravenes international law. In order to get there, the attorney general, Suella Braverman, had to, incredibly, assert in her legal advice that international law is trumped by parliamentary sovereignty, in contravention of the Vienna convention, and that the bill does not flout the ministerial code that places a duty on them to comply with the law. This was an incendiary interjection during a critical week in the Brexit negotiations. If it was intended as a threat to bring the EU closer to the UK positions on the level playing field and fishing rights, it has backfired: the EU has threatened legal action if the government does not alter the bill by the end of the month. The UK's threat to break a treaty it has already signed has further undermined trust and reduces the chance of the bare-bones free trade agreement that the government aspires to. The real intention was, presumably, to signal to voters that the blame lies with the EU if no deal is reached, with all of the consequences that would have for an economy that has just suffered its biggest ever contraction as a result of coronavirus. It raises the question of whether there is any principle that Johnson would not trample over if it suits his political agenda. In threatening to rip up the Good Friday agreement, which guarantees that there will be no border on the island of Ireland, even if that means introducing customs checks and, potentially, tariffs in the Irish Sea in the absence of a free trade deal, the government has further underlined its casual indifference to the Northern Ireland peace process. Any government that prioritised the longevity of the Good Friday agreement would have pursued a Brexit that kept the UK aligned with the single market and customs union; instead, Johnson has shown he is willing to play petty politics with a peace agreement that ended a conflict that cost thousands of lives. The consequences will be felt not just in our relationship with the EU but in our relationship with the United States: Democratic lawmakers have already said that there will be no trade deal with the UK if Brexit undermines the Irish peace process. There are also broader repercussions for Britain's international standing. So much of our criticism of dictatorships and rogue states around the world is founded upon their disregard for the rule of law, from China to Russia to Iran. How can Britain claim to speak with any authority when this charlatan is our prime minister? Time and again, Johnson has shown that he is willing to take unconscionable risks in his political games, regardless of the consequences. It is a Vote Leave approach to governing that prizes populist slogans over real change, soundbites that poll well over any attempt to govern with competence. We have seen the costs in the government's mishandling of this pandemic; a number of unforced errors have contributed to Britain's terrible excess death rate. And now, as a former chief scientific adviser warns that the UK is on 'the edge of losing control'of the virus, there are alarming signs that the government has not used the summer hiatus to get a grip. The test-and-trace system, absolutely key to minimising a second wave of infection, is seriously underperforming. In many areas of the country, it is proving impossible to book a coronavirus test. The government is failing to enable people who have symptoms to stay at home by increasing statutory sick pay from its pitiful level of £96 a week; little surprise then that rates of compliance with the guidelines around self-isolation are far too low when many parents simply cannot afford to take a hit of hundreds of pounds if a family member develops a cough or a temperature. Instead of addressing these serious failings, the government has tried to distract from them with a pie-in-the-sky £100bn 'moonshot'pledge to carry out up to 10m instant Covid-19 tests a day next year. Instead of making it financially possible to comply with its guidance, the government has sought to shift the blame for rising infection rates to the public, despite the mixed messages it sent suggesting that the worst of the virus was over. Instead of preparing for a second wave, it spent the summer picking fights: stirring up strife with anti-racist protesters and the teachers' unions, and sacking civil servants while insulating ministers from the consequences of huge errors such as the A-level grades scandal. This is the government we have as Britain heads into a dangerous autumn, on the cusp of a second pandemic wave and at the most crucial stage of Brexit talks yet. Just as we have rarely been more in need of sober and competent stewardship, we have a prime minister who regards politics as a game and who views fomenting culture wars as fruitful political strategy. His government's response - to the avoidable loss of life, or the blighting of a whole generation's life chances, or the threatened breakup of the union - is lamentable. ",0.125,Positive
Brexit: UK negotiators 'believe brinkmanship will reboot trade talks',-0.125,Negative,"Britain's Brexit negotiators believe Downing Street's plan to break international law, pushing the trade and security negotiations to the brink, may have helped reboot the talks by offering Brussels a reality check about the looming danger of a no-deal outcome. The publication of the internal market bill on Wednesday, under which key parts of the withdrawal agreement agreed last year would be negated, has enraged the EU and prompted an internal rebellion within the Conservative party. Brussels has set Boris Johnson a three-week deadline to ditch his plans or face financial and trade sanctions, with the clear suggestion that negotiations over a future relationship will fail unless the most contentious parts of the proposed legislation are removed. In a sign of the EU's anger at Johnson's move, a committee of MEPs coordinating the European parliament's stance on Brexit, issued a statement on Friday stating they would refuse to ratify any trade and security deal if the UK government had breached the withdrawal agreement or threatened to do so. A Tory rebellion against Johnson's bill is gathering pace: an amendment to the internal market bill by the former minister Bob Neill would give parliament a veto on overriding the UK-EU divorce deal. Late on Friday afternoon, the prime minister sought to quell discontent among some Conservative colleagues over the bill by addressing MPs on the issue during a Zoom call although no questions were taken. In the call, which was disrupted at one stage when the videolink went down, Johnson reportedly stressed that the clauses in the bill were necessary to prevent a foreign power from 'breaking up our country'ù, as well as insisting there were still hopes of a Canada-style trade deal. In a piece in saturday's Telegraph he claimed the EU was threatening to 'blockade'Northern Ireland. 'Let's make the EU take their threats off the table,'he wrote. However, Neill was unconvinced. 'I believe [changing the withdrawal agreement] is potentially a harmful act for this country, it would damage our reputation and I think it will make it harder to strike trade deals going forward,'he told Channel 4 News after the call. Earlier there had been excoriating criticism of the internal market bill by the former Tory leader and Brexit supporter Michael Howard, who predicted many of his colleagues would oppose it and said he would be surprised if it got through the House of Lords, where the government lacks a majority. But Downing Street believes the row with the EU may ultimately prove to be a welcome disruption to the talks, which had been in deadlock throughout the summer over the most thorny issues of the government's future domestic subsidy regime and access to British waters for EU fishing fleets. The British negotiating team, led by David Frost, believes EU capitals are freshly focused on the trade and security negotiations, with Brussels clear-sighted on the risk of the talks collapsing. Negotiations between the teams led by Frost and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, are to continue next week with both sides in agreement that a deal must be ready to be endorsed by EU leaders by 15 October. 'Talks this week have been relatively more constructive than you might expect, but ultimately progress will be determined by whether we get more realism from them on the key areas of divergence,'said one senior UK negotiating official. Progress was claimed to have been achieved after the EU was said to have dropped its policy of 'parallelism'ù, or the insistence that they had to make progress on all elements of talks, ranging from fundamental stumbling blocks of state aid and fisheries to the easier issues. Downing Street's view of a fresh impetus to the negotiation was not echoed by Barnier in a statement issued at the end of the eighth week of negotiations. He said Brussels had offered to accommodate British red-lines in the negotiation, including a major windfall for British fishing boats and the acceptance that the UK would not follow EU law, but Frost had 'not engaged in a reciprocal way on fundamental EU principles and interests'ù. One senior EU source said the week's talks had been 'better than you might expect'but that Brussels was simply focused on carrying on the negotiations until it was clear there was no chance of a deal. 'We don't want to get caught out - there isn't time to waste so this is two sets of civil servants doing their jobs,'said a senior EU diplomat. British sources close to the negotiations said they did not recognise Barnier's account of the latest talks. 'We've been engaged in talks pretty consistently for many months now,'one UK source said. 'The problem is the EU seems to define engagement as accepting large elements of their position. Rather than being engaged in discussions and that's one of the problems that we'll need to overcome.'The government on Wednesday published a thin document on its plans for subsidy control in which it pledged not to return to the bailouts for failing companies that were seen in the 1970s. The UK said it would consult over how to control subsidies in the 'coming months'ù. Barnier said the proposal did not offer the assurance the EU needed and fell 'significantly short of the commitments made in the political declaration'ù, in reference to the paper agreed by Johnson and EU leaders last year about the outline of a deal. A UK source said: 'We believe statements that we put out on Wednesday constitute a very clear statement of the direction, about domestic policy and how [it] interacts with these negotiations while still giving room to have a constructive discussion on the subject. And we're sorry that it wasn't taken in that spirit.'Howard said it was 'a very sad day last week'when the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, admitted that amending the UK's Brexit deal would break international law. 'I never thought it was a thing I'd hear a British minister, far less a Conservative minister, say, which is that the government was going to invite parliament to act in breach of international law,'Howard told Sky News. 'We have a reputation for probity, for upholding the rule of law, and it's a reputation that is very precious and ought to be safeguarded, and I am afraid it was severely damaged by what was said on Tuesday and by the bill which is currently before parliament.'ùMomentum gathered pace on Friday as Neill's initiative, which is being backed by the former ministers Damian Green Oliver Heald, was also signed by Simon Hoare, the chair of the Northern Ireland affairs select committee. Hoare tweeted that US figures 'had a point'in warning that potential destabilisation of the Good Friday agreement could result both in a no-deal Brexit and no trade deal with the US.

Boris Johnson faces Tory rebellions on Brexit and Covid rules,0.25,Positive,"Boris Johnson is facing separate Conservative rebellions on Brexit and Covid-19 rules, as Tory MPs mobilise to undermine the controversial legislation that overrides the EU withdrawal agreement. The tabling of an amendment by a former minister, Bob Neill, to the internal market bill in an effort to create a parliamentary veto on overriding the UK-EU divorce deal sets up a showdown next week on the bill's second reading in the House of Commons. Momentum gathered pace on Friday as Neil's initiative - which is backed by the former immigration minister Damian Green and the former minister and solicitor general Oliver Heald - was also signed by Simon Hoare, chair of the Northern Ireland affairs select committee. Among other senior Conservative figures who have also come out strongly against the bill's proposed powers is the former party leader Michael Howard, who said he would be 'very surprised'if the bill got through the the House of Lords, where the party did not have a majority. The peer said it was 'a very sad day last week when the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, admitted that amending the UK's Brexit deal with the EU will break international law'ù. 'I never thought it was a thing I'd hear a British minister, far less a Conservative minister, say, which is that the government was going to invite parliament to act in breach of international law,'Howard told Sky News. 'We have a reputation for probity, for upholding the rule of law, and it's a reputation that is very precious and ought to be safeguarded, and I am afraid it was severely damaged by what was said on Tuesday and by the bill which is currently before parliament.'Howard's intervention came after the former Conservative prime ministers John Major and Theresa May and former Conservative chancellor of the exchequer Norman Lamont also strongly criticised Johnson's proposals. Amid signs of increasing unease among Tory MPs, there was support from a number of influential chairs of parliamentary committees for comments in the House of Lords by Howard. They included Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs committee, and Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the Commons defence select committee. Ellwood said on Twitter: 'The rule of law is everything - if we forget this we forget who we are, what we stand for and the moral high ground that forms the foundation of our soft power.'Although Neill's initiative would need backing from dozens of MPs in a parliamentary party that has tilted heavily towards a firm pro-Brexit position since the general election, Neill told Times Radio there was support for his amendment on the Tory backbenches. 'I wouldn't be pressing this issue if it was only a hobby horse of mine,'he said. The backlash within Conservative ranks on Brexit coincides with a separate rebellion on Covid-19 rules as one former minister claimed government plans would turn every public space 'into the equivalent of going through airport security'ù. New regulations limiting gatherings in England to no more than six from Monday and moves to have Covid-19 marshals have sparked alarm among some Tory MPs who want parliament to have the power to review measures. Greater parliamentary scrutiny was needed, according to the Tory former minister Steve Baker, who said it was 'now time to say that this is not a fit legal environment for the British people'and there should be a 'voluntary system'ù. 'And it is time for us to actually start living like a free people, not subjecting ourselves to constantly shifting legal requirements, which I think now no one can fully understand,'he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'It seems to me the effect of having Covid marshals will be to turn every public space in Britain into the equivalent of going through airport security where we are badgered and directed '¶ I'm not willing to live like this.'Challenged on why the Westminster government had not followed the path of devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales, which have exempted children under the age of 12 and 11 respectively from 'rule of six'limitations on gatherings, the business minister, Nadhim Zahawi, said the move had been taken in England to provide 'simplicity'ù. 'It goes against the grain, the DNA of a Conservative government, to curtail people's liberties, but the evidence suggests that the virus is at its most virulent in those social interactions, in the home, in the pub and outside, which is why we are reluctantly introducing the rule of six,'he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Brexiter Tory MPs urge PM to ditch withdrawal agreement if no deal,-0.125,Negative,"Pro-Brexit Conservative MPs have urged Boris Johnson to ditch the EU withdrawal agreement should no trade deal be reached, claiming they were promised he would do so before they passed the bill in January. Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the steering group of the European Research Group of hard-Brexit Tory MPs, said Brexit would not be done until the UK government had asserted its own interpretation of the withdrawal agreement. Writing in the Diplomat magazine, Jenkin said the group of MPs who destroyed Theresa May's deal had only voted in favour of Johnson's because they had been assured the government would ditch the agreement if no trade deal was reached with the European Union. 'We only have a WA [withdrawal agreement] because Eurosceptic Conservatives, such as myself, voted for it to help the nation out of a paralysing political crisis,'Jenkin wrote. 'To his credit, the prime minister had ameliorated Mrs May's agreement. 'We made clear, however, that this agreement was barely 'òtolerable' and only voted for it against assurances given by government: that it was just a starting point for negotiations; that it would be superseded by a full FTA [free trade agreement]; and, if needs be, could be repudiated.'Speaking on Tuesday as the latest round of UK-EU talks began, Jenkin said pro-Brexit Conservatives would demand Johnson renege from that legally binding agreement if no deal is reached within five weeks. 'If we don't reach a deal with the EU, Brexit is not done until the UK government succeeds in its determination to assert its own interpretation of the withdrawal agreement,'the Harwich and North Essex MP said.'If the EU is unwilling to do a deal with us, there are two options. The first is to enact domestic legislation that will largely nullify the direct effect and direct applicability of EU law. We have the mandate and majority to do this.'Second, if the EU insists on an unreasonable interpretation of the withdrawal agreement, the UK must stand ready to repudiate it. I hope it is not necessary, but if it is the only way to achieve UK prosperity and the kind of sovereign independence which is the democratic right of any nation recognised under the UN charter, then so be it. And most other nations would respect us for that.'On Monday, it emerged the government was planning to table proposals on Wednesday to give ministers unilateral legal powers to oversee elements of the Northern Ireland protocol, a disclosure which provoked widespread disquiet because the agreement is already legally binding, but which has been backed by Brexiter MPs. A Downing Street spokesman said they 'remain committed to the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol'regardless of whether a deal was reached. 'The withdrawal agreement was written on the basis that subsequent agreements could be reached between us and the EU on the detail through this joint committee process,'the spokesman said. 'That may be possible but as responsible government, we can't allow damaging default positions to kick in if we can't agree these as part of the joint committee process.'",0.375,Positive
Alarm in Dublin and Belfast over Boris Johnson's Brexit threat,0.125,Positive,"As Ireland, north and south, grappled with Boris Johnson's reported threat to renege on the Brexit withdrawal agreement, there was consternation, anxiety, dread - and the hope that it is a bluff. In Dublin, the Irish government attempted to project a sense of concern rather than panic while in Belfast political parties sounded the alarm over the revived prospect of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. All sides - diplomats and politicians, nationalists and unionists - tried to determine whether Downing Street was posturing or serious about unpicking legally binding special arrangements for Northern Ireland. Simon Coveney, Ireland's foreign minister, said media reports that London was planning legislation to override parts of the withdrawal agreement would, if confirmed, damage 11th-hour trade talks with the EU. 'It would fundamentally undermine trust between the two parties,'he told RTE. Coveney said Dublin did not know if the threat, first reported by the FT, was a false report, political gamesmanship or a real prospect. 'We'll have to wait and see.'There is grave concern in Dublin that a hard border on the island of Ireland and severe economic disruption from a no-deal Brexit - its nightmare scenario - will materialise. Coveney's earlier warning that unravelling the withdrawal agreement would be 'unwise'showed mastery of the supposedly British art of understatement, said Bobby McDonagh, a former Irish ambassador. The taoiseach, Miche√°l Martin, is to unveil an updated Brexit readiness plan on Wednesday amid a dire economic backdrop and Covid-19 resurgence. Billy Kelleher, an MEP from the ruling Fianna F√°il party, said he initially dismissed rumours that Britain may bypass the Northern Ireland protocol as a 'wind-up'given its impact on Britain's credibility. 'This is an incredibly worrying time for Ireland, the rest of the EU and indeed the UK. No good can come from this level of brinkmanship. People's livelihoods are being bartered away by the Tories in a way reminiscent of the 18th or 19th century and not of the modern era.'Kelleher said he believed the threat was a ploy and urged Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, to stand firm. In Northern Ireland, nationalist parties warned that rowing back on legally binding commitments would undermine the 1998 Good Friday agreement and destabilise the region. 'The impact will be negative, and the only safeguards we have to mitigate the damage is the protocol,'said Michelle O'Neill, the deputy first minister and Sinn FÈin's deputy leader. 'This would be a betrayal of what has already been agreed and would inflict irreversible harm on our economy and the Good Friday agreement.'O'Neill said Sinn FÈin would seek to rally support in Northern Ireland's Stormont assembly as well as Dublin, Brussels and Washington to defend the 'foundation stones'of the peace process. Colum Eastwood, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said it was astonishing and reckless that the British government would shred its own credibility and undermine the Good Friday agreement. 'They'd be risking a hard border in our country and they'd be threatening the peace and security that we've built up over decades,'he told the BBC. 'If they try to do this at the same time as trying to convince people in Scotland and Northern Ireland about the future of their union, well they may as well forget about that as well.'The Alliance party also voiced concern at potential damage to the Good Friday agreement. The Democratic Unionist party (DUP), which opposed special arrangements for Northern Ireland, made no immediate official response. On Friday its leader, Arlene Foster, said she recognised the protocol was law and that the challenge was to mitigate its impact, only to have the rug pulled from under her by Downing Street's announcement. Sammy Wilson, the DUP's Brexit spokesperson, said the party would not accept the withdrawal agreement - a flat contradiction of his leader that was not issued through the party's press office.

Tony Abbott board of trade appointment raises concern in Australia,0.25,Positive,"The former Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, has been accused of a conflict of interest after he accepted a post as a trade adviser to the UK government, amid continuing criticism of his appointment. Several fellow members of the board of trade of which Abbott will be a member signalled unease over his inclusion. It comes after remarks that have led to his being accused of sexism and homophobia. Political figures in Australia have now raised concerns over his appointment as an adviser to the UK as it seeks post-Brexit trade deals around the world. One Australian senator even suggested he should be forced to register as a foreign agent. Opposition and Tory MPs were among those to express public concerns when Abbott's appointment was confirmed by the Department for International Trade on Friday. His period in office included opposition to climate emergency measures, opposition to gay marriage and controversial immigration plans. He has also been criticised for describing abortion as 'the easy way out'and suggesting that men were better equipped for leadership roles than women. He was also attacked by then-Australian PM Julia Gillard for the views he had expressed. The entrepreneur Anne Boden, a fellow member of the newly appointed board of trade, tweeted that it was 'important that we have challenging voices'ù. However, she also said she supported 'diversity and so did this woman'ù, linking to a video of Gillard's 2012 speech accusing Abbott of misogyny. His appointment has now caused debate in Australia over a potential conflict of interest. Mark Dreyfus, the shadow attorney general in Australia's Labor party, said the Australian government should explain 'how a former Liberal PM can now work for a foreign power advising on matters potentially in direct conflict with Australia's commercial interest '¶ and how conflicts arising from Mr Abbott's intimate knowledge of Australia's trading interests and strategies, gained during his years as minister and prime minister, will be managed.'Other Australian parliamentarians went further. Rex Patrick, an independent senator from South Australia, labelled Abbott's appointment a 'disgrace'and called for the former prime minister to be forced to register as a foreign agent under Australia's foreign influence transparency scheme. He said Abbott should be stripped of 'most'of his travel and office allowance. 'Australian taxpayers shouldn't subsidise a foreign agent,'he said. However, Australia's attorney general Christian Porter, congratulated Abbott. 'Mr Abbott will no doubt be aware of the routine requirements for former cabinet ministers under the foreign influence transparency scheme,'he said. 'In the first instance, it is up to each individual to determine whether or not their circumstances meet the registration requirements.'In a statement released on Friday, Abbott said he was 'only too keen'to help the UK. 'A UK-Australia trade deal, maximising the movement of goods, services and people, is clearly in the best interests of both our countries,'he said. 'My government finalised trade deals between Australia and China, Japan and Korea. I'm looking forward to bringing that expertise to bear as Britain works towards mutually beneficial improvements with its major trading partners.'Boris Johnson has defended the appointment, which is an unpaid position. 'I obviously don't agree with those sentiments at all but then I don't agree with everyone who serves the government,'he said on Friday. 'What I would say about Tony Abbott is this is a guy who was elected by the great liberal democratic nation of Australia.'However, shadow trade secretary Emily Thornberry criticised the move. 'He's never been involved in detailed trade negotiations, he thinks that issues like climate change and workers' rights are just not important, and during the two years that he was prime minister of Australia he was personally responsible for killing off Australia's car industry,'she told Times Radio.

Brussels rules out summit intervention in troubled Brexit talks,-0.75,Negative,"Boris Johnson's hopes of a Brexit deal have been dealt a fresh blow as Brussels ruled out EU leaders intervening in the troubled negotiations at a summit this month. According to EU diplomats, both the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and Downing Street have lobbied for 27 heads of state and government to seize control of the talks given the current impasse. Despite the parlous state of the talks, the former Belgian prime minister Charles Michel, who now chairs the leaders' meetings as president of the European council, has decided to focus on the bloc's recovery from the coronavirus and relations with China at the summit on 25 September. EU sources said expectations were 'extremely low'for the next round of negotiations, which start on Tuesday, after a disappointing meeting between Barnier and the UK's negotiator David Frost in London this week. 'From those discussions there is no basis to believe that there will be any progress at all next week,'said one EU source. 'There was nothing new in what London was saying and there is no reason to think that this coming week will offer any progress.'The major obstacle to a deal remains the issue of the UK's plans for its domestic subsidy regime from 1 January 2021 when the country leaves the EU's single market and customs union. In a tweet on Friday, Frost acknowledged the low expectations for progress in the coming week. He tweeted: 'We will negotiate constructively but the EU's stance may, realistically, limit the progress we can make next week.'3/3 From the very beginning we have been clear about what we can accept in these areas, which are fundamental to our status as an independent country. We will negotiate constructively but the EU's stance may, realistically, limit the progress we can make next week. Asked about growing concerns of a no deal exit, however, the prime minister insisted that the UK would 'prosper mightily'even if it does not strike a trade deal with the EU. During a visit to Solihull, where he was inspecting a HS2 construction site, Johnson told reporters: 'We're ready for any eventuality, of course. But we must make sure that people understand that at the end of the year, whatever happens, we are using the EU. 'We will get through this. It's vital that our partners understand that the UK is going to do what we need to do. 'If we need to have an Australia-style deal, an Australia-style solution, then that is what we will achieve and we will prosper mightily one way or the other. 'They could be sensible and give us a Canada-style solution, which after all they've given Canada, and I very much hope they will, but we're ready for either eventuality.'In the face of British opposition, the EU has moved from its opening position that EU rules on so-called state aid should be incorporated into UK law to ensure that neither side can unfairly prop up their major businesses. But EU officials said the bloc was unable to work on an alternative solution until Downing Street publishes its plans for controlling the level of subsidies. 'The problem is that they said in January and February that they needed time for a democratic debate on this subject but that we still haven't had a trace of what they are going to do,'said a diplomatic source. The UK's negotiators have insisted domestic subsidy policy is irrelevant to a free trade deal and point out that the EU has leant on World Trade Organization provisions in previous deals. In the EU's trade deal with Canada there is no requirement for either side to seek approval for subsidies from the other but the issue of trade distortions can be an issue for consultation. EU sources said there was a 'misjudgment on the British side if they think that this can be left to the last minute'ù. One source said: 'We have not been told when the domestic subsidy regime will be published, but what happens when it lands late September and it fails to offers the EU side any assurances over the future? It will be too late.'A UK government spokesman said: 'There is still a lot more work to do, but it remains our goal to reach an agreement and we'll continue to work hard to do so. We need more realism from the EU and for them to show that they understand the fundamentals of our position as an independent and sovereign country.'The cabinet is said to be divided over whether to establish hard rules on state subsidies and an independent regulator or allow the government more leeway. 'We cannot do anything until the UK decides what it wants,'said an EU official. The UK is due to leave the single market and customs union on 31 December 2020. A deal needs to be negotiated by the end of October or the first week of November to allow time for parliamentary ratification. ",0.125,Positive
Former Australian PM Tony Abbott tipped for post-Brexit UK trade advisory role,-0.125,Negative,"He has previously praised the 'solidarity'of the English-speaking nations that share strong bonds with the UK. Now the former Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, is tipped to be appointed to advise the UK - his birthplace - on how to seize trade opportunities post-Brexit. The Guardian understands there's been speculation in Australian government circles for some time that Abbott - a social conservative who was prime minister for nearly two years until he was toppled in a snap party vote in 2015 - was in line for a British trade advisory role of some form. That talk intensified on Wednesday when the Sun reported that the 'forthright Aussie'would become Britain's 'new trade deal supremo'ù. While the Sun suggested that Abbott would be joint president of the UK Board of Trade, this could not immediately be confirmed, with the UK high commission in Canberra saying the reports were premature. Bevan Shields, an Australian London-based journalist for the Nine newspapers, reported on Twitter that he had been informed the story was not accurate. Instead, Abbott was likely to join the board 'in some sort of advisory capacity'ù. My understanding is that this story is NOT correct. Tony Abbott is likely to join the Board of Trade in some sort of advisory capacity but will not be the co-president https://t.co/z9O1GpfBTz The Board of Trade - which meets quarterly - brings together figures from business and politics, according to the UK government. Those figures 'make up the advisers to the Board of Trade and represent the business voice from the whole of the UK'ù. The board has previously been ridiculed because the international trade secretary was the only official member. The Department for International Trade noted that membership of the board of trade was 'restricted to privy councillors'and others served as advisers. Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister, was asked about the reports of Abbott's appointment on Wednesday and said only that it would be 'a good hire'ù. Abbott, who was ousted as prime minister by his colleague Malcolm Turnbull in 2015, was then turfed out of federal parliament last year when he lost his Sydney seat of Warringah in the federal election last year. The London-born Abbott, who moved to Australia when he was two years old and later studied at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar in the 1980s, has previously been effusive about the shared bonds of English-speaking countries. In his 2009 book Battlelines, Abbott wrote: 'The bonds between the countries of the anglosphere arise from patterns of thinking originally shaped by Shakespeare and the King James Bible, constantly reinforced by reading each other's books, watching the same movies and consuming the same international magazines. 'It's a solidarity based on ideas in common and even mutually shared differences of opinion rather than on race, religion or economic self-interest.'In early 2016, Abbott wrote a piece in the Times recommending British voters choose stay in the EU rather than vote for Brexit. 'Any British decision to withdraw from the European Union would have seismic consequences,'he wrote. 'There's much to dislike about the EU but very little that would be improved if Britain left.'It did not take long after the vote to leave, for Abbott to say he was 'quietly thrilled'with the result and recant his former Brexit scepticism, becoming an enthusiastic supporter. In 2019, Abbott was accused of lacking a 'basic grasp of economics'after a piece in the Spectator called No deal? No problem, in which he wrote that 'as a former prime minister of a country that has a perfectly satisfactory 'òno deal' relationship with the EU, let me assure you: no deal would be no problem'ù, Abbott wrote. 'A no-deal relationship with the EU has not stopped Australia doing about US$70 billion worth of trade with the EU in goods and services.'Economists said Abbott's comparison fundamentally ignored how the EU common market worked as well as complex supply chains in manufacturing industries such as carmaking and aerospace. 1/ I see Australia's former Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, had waded into the fray once more with another enlightened take in the Spectator. Being Australian gives me a sense of responsibility here, so I'll wade through it so that you don't have to. https://t.co/KHIdTdfqH8 ",1.375,Positive
"The Irish Sea border means chaos looms, even with a Brexit deal",-0.125,Negative,"Among thousands of lorries crossing the Irish Sea each day, I spotted Manfreight's orange livery on the Birkenhead to Belfast ferry. Carrying just-in-time deliveries of short shelf-life food or Amazon parcels, they have just four more months of carefree border-crossing before the Brexit shutter slams. 'Over my dead body'will there be an Irish Sea trade border, Boris Johnson proclaimed this month with breathtaking mendacity. That's the protocol he signed, the international treaty all his MPs voted for; no wriggling out now. Crossing the Irish Sea will require still-unbuilt checkpoints at ports; lorry parks; voluminous customs declarations; veterinary checks; and tariffs to be paid and reclaimed, with 50,000 extra customs officers as yet unrecruited. From his office in Craigavon, County Armagh, Chris Slowey of Manfreight watches the EU negotiations appalled, preparing for avalanches of paperwork. Since his father founded the company 45 years ago, inside the then European Economic Community, 'we've had no experience whatever of customs'ù. He runs through just some of the certificates required for every trip his 200 lorries will take, 'the weight and cost of every item; the number of pallets; all ingredients and their origins for maybe 3,000 different products. If you're a few cases short when you arrive, everything is rechecked.'He can hardly believe the madness of it. The Brexiters' claim to escape 'Brussels red tape'has created this instead - even with a deal, let alone without. Showing me round, Slowey talks of lettuces: 'They come from Spain. We add more from Spalding, bring them to Northern Ireland where they add carrots. After processing, washing and bagging we take them back to GB supermarkets.'Why these long lettuce journeys? 'Food processing is a Northern Ireland mainstay, we're very expert. But customs, tariffs and delays will see that work shift to Scotland.'He talked of quiches: just one item collected from Kerry foods in Ireland, trucked to a Leeds supermarket, will need three vet checks for the ham, milk and eggs, each costing up to £50, and there's a vet shortage. All this risks tipping food companies into unprofitability, warns Prof Katy Hayward of Queens University Belfast, with mainland British businesses abandoning the region, raising prices. As for promised whizz-bang hi-tech electronic certification of trusted trader lorries far away from borders: 'It doesn't exist anywhere - and how good are we at track and trace technology?'The government belatedly announced money for a trader support service to aid customs for small companies: not nearly enough, says Slowey. That afternoon a food-processing customer called to say the company was closing for now, after an outbreak of Covid-19. Will they still pay for Manfreight's contract? 'No, it's all pay as you go.'The virus takes its toll everywhere. Road haulage is a tough business, with a nationwide shortage of drivers. Slowey trains his own, who stay, but conditions on British roads are disgusting for drivers: poor facilities, often nowhere to sleep, filthy lay-bys, no toilets, services in the wrong places; an industry utterly neglected by the state despite everything that depends on road freight. 'We kept the shops stocked - they are key workers,'he says of his drivers. Waiting for the Brexit outcome, tariffs will matter: Manfreight buys 40 new Volvo lorries a year from Europe and no deal will mean a 10% duty of £12,000 each, almost half a million pounds in total. Another un-negotiated item is cabotage - the right of one country's trucks to pick up goods in another on their way home. No deal means huge extra costs, with empty trucks belching diesel fumes across Europe. So it was more bad news that day when UK/EU negotiations broke down acrimoniously. Michel Barnier, the EU negotiator, announced an agreement was now 'unlikely'as he toured the 27 EU states warning them to prepare for no deal. There was 'no progress whatsoever'on the old obstacles - fisheries, state aid, a level playing field, and environmental and social standards. If there is a typical EU 11th-hour fix, it will be a thin unfriendly deal, which Hayward warns will still mean massive border disruption. The EU will still need to stop around 5,000 goods entering via Ireland, to stop unfair competition as the UK has lowered tariffs.  Slowey thinks few companies are ready for the Brexit shock. 'They all jumped last time, some filling warehouses with product that went out of date. So this time everyone's waiting. You can't prepare when no one knows what the rules will be.'In a world where people running businesses wait for unknowable regulations, 'taking back control'has no meaning. Brexiters promised 'access to the single market'ù, Johnson's 'oven-ready deal'the 'easiest in human history', with no 'sudden change that disrupts the economy'- and even that 'wages will be higher for working people outside the EU'. None of that was true. Nor could any deal be Brexity enough for the fanatics, who are bound to brand it Brino (Brexit in name only). Iain Duncan Smith now rejects the withdrawal agreement he backed, as Nigel Farage licks his lips. He claims he only stood down his 317 Brexit party candidates because Johnson promised no Brexit concessions. Johnson is faced with either a deal that risks Farage becoming resurgent across red wall seats or no-deal chaos at the ports filling the TV news. Labour needs Brexit to be a dead issue by the next election, though EU relations would turn quietly reconstructive under a Starmer government. Meanwhile, as the politics of deal or no deal hang in the air, every likely result will be hard on UK freight, on manufacturers and services everywhere, whose protests go unheard in Westminster.

"Mike Bartlett on Albion, Brexit and Covid: 'national identity is critical to coming out of this'",-0.25,Negative,"Mike Bartlett's 2017 play Albion returned to London's Almeida theatre in February, the week after Britain left the EU. It didn't mention Brexit but the story reflected its mournful divisions. Then the Covid-19 pandemic struck and dwarfed the drama's concerns of nationhood, patriotism and nostalgic notions of Englishness. Or did it? 'Some were saying in the early stages of Covid that the virus had blown those divisions out of the water,'says Bartlett. 'Actually, I don't think it has '¶ Everything that has happened in regard to questions of national identity has become fundamental to what we want to do coming out of this.'The production's director, Rupert Goold, reflected that 'plays, like plants, grow over time'ù. Albion has gathered nuance each time it is repotted. It features a metropolitan, middle-class family who move to the countryside. Britain's relationship with Europe was still seen by some to hang in the balance when it was first staged. By the time of its 2020 revival, Bartlett felt it to be a very different play. It is now set to be broadcast by the BBC and feels newly relevant once again, Bartlett thinks, especially after the fallout from George Floyd's killing, which has thrown definitions of nationhood and national identity into further dispute: 'Boris Johnson was using war metaphors and world war two rhetoric about a country coming together [in the midst of the pandemic] but that sits uneasily with the Black Lives Matter movement. There is the idea that this narrative is not only irrelevant but that its history - and its statutes - are offensive. The very thing that a lot of white people are proud of is what others are saying is to be ashamed of, so it's problematic and the unpicking will take time. [Until then] the competition over a national identity will be as hot an issue, just as fought for, as it was before.'The nation's soil plays a vital part in the drama; its indomitable matriarch, Audrey, played by Victoria Hamilton, plants a garden that becomes a potent symbol of love - for her son who has died fighting for his country but also, by extension, her land. The connective tissue between land and national identity contains all the weight of Britain's colonial history, says Bartlett. It is there in that incontrovertibly British hymn, Jerusalem, in which 'even Jesus has been colonised - we've got him here [in our green and pleasant land]'ù. Bartlett refers to Salman Rushdie's definition of home - as a place of 'roots'that connect us to the land - but also of the 'routes'or journeys that make a new land our home. He feels this lies at the heart of the conflict - a Britishness that stems from the idea that 'we have been here'versus that which involves immigrant journeys. Several others plays by Bartlett have been brought back in the past year, from Snowflake at the Kiln to Love, Love, Love (whose run at the Lyric Hammersmith was cut short by Covid-19). On screen, his series Doctor Foster has been hugely successful, while his play King Charles III has also been adapted for TV. His BBC drama Life, expected to air this year, stars Hamilton, Alison Steadman and Adrian Lester, and revolves around a shared house in Manchester. Again it seems to untangle the issues of our day in its exploration of community and what we owe to other people. 'We are all atomised, especially recently, but even before lockdown. It's about people finding connections and also how we form a community when society doesn't believe in it.'So much of his work burns with urgent themes - Earthquakes in London looked at climate change, 13 at religious belief in the 21st century and Game at video-game violence. These issues never set the plays' agenda in themselves, says Bartlett, but are foregrounded by the more complicated drama of human relationships. Albion sought to explore the emotional aspects of the arguments around Britishness. 'It's not an academic debate about the EU, it's absolutely fundamental to who people feel they are in the world. I felt it important to understand the emotional weight of it.'Would he describe Albion as a family drama or political play? 'The phrase I stumble over is 'òpolitical play'. I do think there's a thrill to seeing a play that talks about what we're talking about now. I love writing about politics and power. But the reason I stumble is because it conjures a more didactic, opinion-based drama that forces politics on the audience. We have already had to listen to so many opinions in politics and the media. Bartlett became a writer partly to escape his own world. 'The reason I loved theatre was because I could imagine myself in other people's shoes. I was not that interested in me.'The original plan was to go into directing, which may be why he is such a willing collaborator. 'That sense of company is vital to me. I love writing but I don't write many stage directions. It's for other people to make it real. [The playwright] Sarah Kane used to talk about the provocation to collaborate, so you write impossible stage directions and in response to that the director has to think of imaginative solutions. Earthquakes in London was full of stage directions which asked the impossible - at one point a foetus turns to the camera in a baby scan and screams - and in Cock there is direction for no naturalistic movement. James [Macdonald], its director, said, 'òHow do we do nothing?''Bartlett's lockdown in Oxfordshire, with his wife and their children, has been pleasant enough. 'I have a garden, I'm alive and healthy. We have been lucky to keep working remotely and to be able to enjoy a bit more time with the children. I've been doing some home schooling and finding that maths is more difficult than I anticipated. A lot of people will treasure this time with family - or at least, the lucky ones will.'He is acutely aware of the wider tensions that now lie exposed. 'One thing the lockdown has done is magnify existing issues - of mental health, inequality, class, race, the value of the NHS.'Has he had the appetite for online theatre? 'I have young children and getting to the theatre was quite hard so having it online is great.'He contests the suggestion that it's a 'lesser'form, citing the TV dramas of the 1970s, like I Claudius, which were staged like plays. 'It's half play and half TV drama. I was already feeling that there was a form there that was interesting.'They open up access, too, for audiences who can't travel or afford the ticket prices. There has been a lot of resistance to recording live performance, he says. 'With standup comedy, which often goes out at prime time, there is one person, one set. All you are doing is listening to that one performer but it sustains itself. No one worries whether it is live or if you lose something from seeing it on screen. The lockdown has made me think we should be less precious about putting [live theatre] on film. It's not the same thing as being there, but that's OK.'When theatres reopen, what kind of drama does he want to make? 'I want to see less plays documenting experiences that we've just been through and more stories that engage with the other side of this,'he says. 'The question of what world we want to create.'Albion is on BBC4 on 16 August and then on iPlayer ",0.25,Positive
The Russia report shows we have a security problem. He lives in No 10,-0.25,Negative,"If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, is it a duck? Or, more pertinently, at the moment, if Boris Johnson acts like a Russian asset and talks like a Russian asset, is he a Russian asset? This isn't a cute Johnsonian provocation. An 'asset'in intelligence terms is not necessarily someone who actively works for a foreign state. It's someone who's used by a foreign state. It's someone who acts - knowingly or unknowingly - to further that state's interests. I'm not making allusions to Johnson's meeting at an Italian palazzo with the former London KGB chief weeks after Russia had released a chemical weapon on Britain's streets, which I reported on last autumn, as gobsmacking as that was. Or his relationship with Alexander Temerko, a Russian oligarch, who happens to both try to influence Tory policy and give the party money. Because Johnson almost certainly does only what is in Johnson's best interests. It's just that in the case of Russian interference in our elections, and specifically the EU referendum, Johnson's best interests are Russia's best interests. And it was in both of their interests last week to disregard the findings of the report published by the intelligence and security committee (ISC). 'This is about pressure from Islington Remainers who had seized on this report to try to give the impression that Russian interference was somehow responsible for Brexit,'Johnson said, in response to a question that had nothing to do with Brexit. It doesn't matter why Johnson who, until 2016 was an Islington Remainer, made these remarks. Or what motivated him or what he seeks to gain from them. But by politicising a report from the ISC he has done something dark and dangerous. Because the ISC does not act like other committees. It is scrupulously non-partisan and proudly independent. The findings of the report were endorsed by its current and previous Conservative chairs. And to reject its findings is not just a foreign policy win for Russia - and all other states that could benefit from interfering in our elections - it's a fork in the road for Britain, the parliamentary democracy. 'This committee has been subject to unprecedented delay and dislocation,'Julian Lewis, the committee's new chair, said on Tuesday. 'This must never happen again.'But what can be done to prevent it? Nothing. What did Johnson know, when? What role did he play in MI6's lack of action? Is he negligent? Is he complicit? And will someone ask Sir Alex Younger, the head of MI6? Because in December 2016, a month after the US election, he made a rare public speech. The internet had changed everything, he said, and the 'connectivity at the heart of globalisation'had created a 'fundamental threat to our sovereignty'ù. It was a warning. But to whom? The prime minister, Theresa May? Or his boss? Boris Johnson. It took nearly a year for any kind of response at all. Then, in November 2017, May made a landmark speech: 'Russia, we know what you are doing,'she said. The timing of this was not an accident. It was two weeks after the first of Robert Mueller's indictments were unsealed. Many threads of his investigation ran through London. The Russian ambassador was a key conduit between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin in the summer of 2016, when Johnson was foreign secretary. And WikiLeaks, based in London's Ecuadorean embassy, was revealed to be 'Organisation A'ù, a channel for Russian intelligence. It was no longer credible to ignore British involvement in a transatlantic web of Kremlin-influenced operations. And yet that's exactly what we did. That's the revelation of last week. 'In stark contrast to the US handling of allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election,'the report notes, 'where an intelligence community assessment was produced within two months.'Hundreds of FBI agents, lawyers and prosecutors worked for more than three years on Mueller's investigation in the US. Here, on the other hand, when asked by the committee for its assessment on Russian interference in the referendum, MI5 initially handed over six lines. Six lines! This has been staring us in the face for four years. We know the big tech platforms have created a vulnerability at the heart of our democracies. We can no longer feign ignorance. And yet we do. Perhaps at the heart of it all is the infected abscess that is the EU referendum. We need to understand what happened in it, the MPs said last week, to have any hope of protecting our elections in the future. This is an urgent matter of our national security, uncomfortably overlapping with our politics. Because what else might an inquiry find? The Russians stand accused of exploiting with disinformation and lies the same platform that Johnson's chief aide, Dominic Cummings, exploited with disinformation and lies. And then there's Arron Banks. Or 'page 13, footnote 50'ù, as Kevan Jones, the MP for North Durham, told the press conference when asked if Banks was in the report. The only individual named in the 44 pages, as a tweet from Leave.EU pointed out, 'and cleared'ù, and who had threatened to sue the committee before it had even published. By the time Theresa May made her speech in November 2017, I'd been working for a year on my investigation into big tech and the EU referendum and was disturbed by the lack of investigation in Britain. That week, I wrote an angry piece: 'Theresa May has finally acknowledged that Britain is not insulated from fake news and lies from the Kremlin, but what is the government going to do about it?' Nothing, it turned out. Not a thing. Earlier this year, I spent days writing a chronology of this investigation. It's for the court case that Mr [REDACTED] footnote 50, p13 continues against me. November 2017 was an inflection point, not just for me but Britain too. Just three months later, Russia would use a nerve agent on our streets and kill a British citizen. 'Russia, we know what you are doing,'May said. But we didn't. We still don't. And, under Boris Johnson, we refuse to look. This is a vital report that demands a response. That it hasn't got one from the man who is leading the country is a source of profound disquiet. This is a critical moment and the decisions we make now will affect our future. If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it is a duck. Britain has a national security problem. And his name is Boris Johnson.

The Guardian view on Labour and PR: fix a flawed system,-0.625,Negative,"Britain - with France - is one of the few major countries in Europe where parliamentary seats won at a general election are not shared out between the parties in a proportional manner. Any vote not used to win a seat is, in effect, wasted. 'First past the post'does offer ideological clarity and accountability. But this is at the expense of representation. All this contributes to the cynicism and disaffection felt for politics, and a dangerous sense that British voters have too little sway over those who govern them. Brexit was built on such discontents and there is widespread agreement that, in the future, power ought to be redistributed more fairly. The question is less what to do than how to do it. To build a better society we need a better politics. The present electoral system shows no sign of delivering this. Instead it reinforces a Labour-Tory duopoly, shuts out smaller parties and rewards nationalist ones - because votes piled up in one area are easier to convert into seats than those that are thinly spread. This is not just a matter of disproportionate outcomes, it is also a matter of disproportionate power to factions within parties that win. Most people voted for parties to the left of the Conservatives in the last general election. Yet a little more than 40% of the votes gave the Tories an apparent impregnable parliamentary majority and handed Boris Johnson's 'hard Brexit'clique absolute control of policy. As loyalty to Mr Johnson rather than ability is the critical qualification for high office, it is no surprise that Britain has the wrong government for the Covid-19 crisis. When running to be Labour leader, Keir Starmer committed to a constitutional convention and to look at reform of the voting system. He was responding to the groundswell of support in the Labour membership for a more proportional way of electing MPs after December's election defeat. However, Labour has long been divided on electoral reform. On Monday the party's consultation about how to proceed with constitutional change will close, but it seems to have largely sidestepped the issue of the way votes translate into seats. Instead the consultation focused on how federalism could counter the damage wrought by the centralising nature of the British state. Devolving power to the regions is an important and urgent issue. But Sir Keir should put electoral reform back on to the table. A proportional system of voting would unlock different institutions and cultures in British political life. It is true that less than a decade ago reformers lost a referendum on whether to change the voting system for British general elections. But governments in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are all elected on versions of proportional representation (PR). Even Labour's national executive committee, which oversees party policy, will hold elections using a form of PR. Political parties that win power may be reluctant to change the voting system to which they owe their success. However, British democracy will not be repaired until the voting system is made genuinely more proportional. Mr Johnson did set up a 'constitution, democracy and rights'commission that could have examined electoral shortcomings. But it seems designed, unfortunately, to avenge the slights Brexiters think they suffered at the hands of a remain establishment. It has also disappeared from view. For Labour the modernising years of 1997 until 2010 remain unfinished business. Sir Keir may wish to wait and see where the government is going before making his move. But without some sort of electoral reform that engages the public, the pressure to mend a broken system may blow up politics once more.

"My allotment was once a casual hobby. Since lockdown, it's become a lifeline",-0.375,Negative,"Smugness is a well-documented side-effect of having an allotment, and at this time of year, with raspberries, gooseberries, currants, new potatoes and other goodies ripening and making it to the table, the condition becomes particularly acute. 'Notice anything about these spuds?'I can't help myself asking, faux-casually, over dinner. 'And how about the chard? Particularly delicious, no?'To which the only acceptable answer, clearly, is a chorus of: 'Oh yes, I noticed that immediately, I've never tasted such magnificent chard in my life.'(For some reason, this is not a response that comes naturally to my children.) Many plot-holders will be even more insufferable this year, as we've had so much more time than usual to spend tending our plots. Allotments have been open throughout lockdown, designated as safe spaces for daily exercise. I nearly gave mine up before the pandemic, as I was too busy working and socialising to keep the weeds at bay. Boy, am I glad I kept it: as a mother of two energetic boys without much outdoor space at home, our plot has been a lifeline. In those dark days of early lockdown, the plot was one of the few places we could relax outdoors (we dearly love our local park, but less so in the period when you had to pretend to do push-ups if you didn't want to get moved on by the police). It retained a precious air of normality, while the world outside turned upside down; plot-holders are used to relating to one another at a distance, offering a friendly wave or a pruning tip from a few metres away. And it gave me a sense of purpose, in the absence of work and human contact. There's no better cure for existential angst than a vigorous weeding session (check out The Well Gardened Mind by Sue Stuart-Smith for more on the many mental health benefits of gardening). When supermarket shelves were ominously bare, growing food started to feel like a genuinely useful choice of hobby. It's no surprise that demand for seeds and compost boomed this spring; the pandemic gave all of us a sharp and shocking lesson about the vulnerability of supply chains. Even before the pandemic there was a surge in demand for allotments, with waiting lists in England growing from fewer than 10 people per 100 plots in 1996, to more than 50 for every 100 plots in 2013. Councils have a legal obligation to provide enough growing space to meet demand. And yet, a recent study by the Institute for Sustainable Food at the University of Sheffield found that the quantity of land used for allotments in urban areas has fallen by 65% over the past 50 years. And - you guessed it - poorer areas have lost out most, with eight times the number of closures seen in the wealthiest neighbourhoods. Restoring old allotment land into use could, researchers claim, feed an extra 14,107 people. Those of us lucky enough to have a plot may come to appreciate it even more if our government gets its way with new, non-EU trade deals. There has been much ado about the prospect of chlorinated chicken, but the implications of a trade deal with the US are equally grim for fruit and veg. The American government will insist on our loosening regulations around the use of pesticides, so we can look forward to apples containing higher levels of malathion (an organophosphate insecticide linked to cancer which can impair the respiratory system) and grapes with added propargite, an insecticide that has been associated with cancer and can affect sexual function and fertility. Oh yes, and then there are neonicotinoids, all but banned in the UK because of their toxic effect on bees, and chlorpyrifos, banned by the EU over concerns about its impact on the brains of foetuses and young children. Enjoy your meal! If a US deal goes ahead we may not get a choice about whether or not we buy this stuff. British producers will be stuck between a rock and a hard place: not only will they be undercut by cheaper alternatives, but if UK food starts to contain more toxic pesticides they will struggle to meet EU standards, losing their primary export market. Overwhelmingly, the British public wants high food standards; it is likely to get a race to the bottom. But the really bad news is that allotment-holders could be about to get a whole lot smugger.

How does David Frost's new job affect Brexit talks?,0.25,Positive,"Brexit negotiations have resumed in Brussels in an attempt to break the deadlock over four key issues: fisheries, fair competition in trade, governance and security. Talks started on Monday with a two-hour, face-to-face meeting between David Frost, the chief UK negotiator, and the EU's Michel Barnier, the first since the Covid-19 outbreak halted talks in March. As Frost and his team of a dozen-plus negotiators headed to Brussels by train on Sunday, it was being revealed that Boris Johnson had given him a new role (and a peerage) as his national security adviser. The timing of Frost's appointment could not have been more pointed. Although the vacancy has arisen because of the resignation of the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, on Sunday night, giving the post to someone who is leading arguably the most important international talks since the Iraq war in 2003 sends a strong message to Brussels that the UK is prepared to walk away if a deal cannot be struck in summer talks. Frost is due to take up his new role in September and this cuts perilously short the time in which to seal the comprehensive and ambitious deal Johnson claims he wants before the end of the Brexit transition period. The prime minister's spokesman said on Monday Frost would not be replaced as chief negotiator but said he would continue to lead the negotiating team even after his appointment as security adviser. Many will be concerned that such double-jobbing will compromise his capacity for his Brexit role but he has the full support of Johnson, who describes him as a 'serious diplomat, policy thinker and negotiator'ù. This week is one of six rounds of week-long talks, five between now and the end of July, with the final round scheduled for 17 August. On the agenda are governance, fisheries, level playing field, trade in goods, trade in services, criminal law and judicial cooperation, energy and transport, participation in EU programmes such as science research, and continued mobility of social benefits for EU citizens in the UK and British citizens in the EU. Both sides have expressed the real prospect of no deal. Johnson said this month he wanted to see an outline of a deal emerge from the July talks while the European parliament president, David Sassoli, last week said the EU had been left concerned at the end of a video conference with Johnson two weeks ago over the lack of 'enthusiasm'the prime minister seemed to have to find common ground on the most contentious issues. The two sides remain fundamentally divided on the four key issues stated above but notably on the role of the European court of justice in dispute resolution and governance. Frost has said there can be 'no halfway house'on the role of the ECJ or other EU institutions. The Cambridge law professor Catherine Barnard, an expert on EU law, recently told a government select committee it was 'quite difficult to find a really good landing zone'here and not just because the UK objects to the ECJ. The problem is that what both sides will be striving to adjudicate are breaches of an international treaty rather than company contracts, meaning disputes over the Brexit deal 'will be state to state rather than private party to private party'ù, she said. Given that Frost's new job will be to advise the government on this issue, it is ironic that this is the one topic the UK has decided not to engage in any negotiations although it can be argued that defence can be driven by events such as war and other platforms such as Nato. However, concerns have been raised over weaker security ties, on extradition, and on Britain's desire to have continued access to real-time passenger records for counter-terror responses without conditions. Yes. It is hoped that five weeks of face-to-face meetings might yield results as they allow more nuanced discussions in informal meeting in corridors and over dinners. This week's meeting is restricted to about 16 people from each side compared with 100 in previous rounds, allowing for further frank discussion. ",-0.25,Negative
Boris Johnson's U-turn shows the assault on liberal values is faltering,0.625,Positive,"Harold Wilson - who lost his only election as Labour leader half a century ago today - once said a week is a long time in politics. If that was right, then how long is an entire year? Eleven months ago, the Conservative party looked into the abyss and decided Boris Johnson was the right answer to its (and Britain's) problems. It did this because most Tory members, though not most Tory MPs, thought he would deliver the hard Brexit they favoured, and be electorally popular. Johnson was never the ideal leadership candidate, and many Tories opposed him bitterly. But he won because he was seen by the majority as the party's last best hope in a very tight spot. The party got that bit right. A year on, it is clear that the Tories took an electorally rational decision. Johnson duly played hardball with a hung parliament in which he had no majority - and he won. The opposition parties overplayed their hands by agreeing to an early election. Johnson triumphed at the polls at the expense of a mistrusted Labour party. Brexit duly took place, and Johnson reigned supreme. His enemies were cowed and marginalised. And then came Covid-19. Today, as Johnson approaches the first anniversary of his premiership, there is a volatile new political reality. Criticism of Johnson is again common within the Tory party. There are deepening divides about the government's direction, priorities and leadership. Some of these relate to the handling of Covid-19. Others concern Covid-19's vast economic consequences. These are the seeds of future internal conflicts. But the volatility has other causes too. Clumsy handling of the Black Lives Matter protests and the U-turn on free school meals have added to the unstable mix. These have come on the heels of volte-faces on migrant health worker NHS charges and parliamentary voting. Together they create a nervous Tory mood at Westminster, and foster a wider sense of a government that has lost its way. These anxieties more typically affect a government well into its midterm period. Whether their occurrence so soon into Johnson's term is all because of the pandemic, or whether they would have broken out anyway, is an unanswerable question. Experience, though, suggests the latter cannot be dismissed. As the veteran Tory party-watcher Professor Tim Bale puts it: 'Johnson's success was not built on firm foundations in the first place. There was always a real danger of future subsidence under the property.'Two decisions this week highlight this. The first was the axing of the international development department. This had always been a Little Englander demand, which is precisely why David Cameron made DfID's continuation and budget such signature commitments in his modernisation agenda. Johnson's decision is the exact reverse, a dogwhistle to the Tory party's nativist right wing. Just as symbolic is the decision, again announced this week, that Johnson will splash the public's cash on upgrading the prime ministerial aircraft. In the scheme of things, this is a minor matter. Yet, coming in the same week that Johnson had to be shamed by the footballer Marcus Rashford into maintaining the school meals voucher scheme over the summer, it is more resonant. As with the Dominic Cummings debacle, it proclaims one law for the prime minister and another for the little people. It displays an almost Neronian indifference to the nation's larger anxieties. All this raises longer term and difficult questions about what kind of Conservative government Johnson really leads. It is true that these flames can be fanned by journalists, who have a material interest in writing about splits. It is also true that this Tory government remains one with a working majority of more than 80, and four years more to run. It has plenty of time to sort things out and regain the initiative before 2024. It may well do so. Nevertheless, it is clear that Johnson suffered avoidable political damage from Covid-19. The pandemic presented him with a huge challenge but also a huge opportunity. It offered the chance to gain broader national support instead of the highly polarised platform defined by Brexit. Johnson appeared to be flirting with the idea of being a national leader at times but, as so often in his political career, he eventually failed to put his shoulder to the task. Instead he took the easier option. As a result, his poll ratings plunged from their early pandemic heights to new lows. Johnson's response to his declining popularity has been revealing, most of all to those who want to believe his one-nation talk. Especially after the Cummings affair, Johnson has retrenched. Many Tory backbenchers are aghast at the degree to which Cummings has been rewarded for the scandal he created, by redoubled control over the government's agenda. Faced with the first Labour leader in a decade who looks like a prime minister, Johnson appears to have evacuated the middle ground and, at Cummings's direction, pitched his tent on the right. There is one long-term reason why this may make sense. The Tory party remains overwhelmingly Margaret Thatcher's party of low taxes, low spending, the small state, social authoritarianism and a particularly English sense of post-imperial exceptionalism. These views are more firmly in the ascendant than ever in the Tory party. Johnson is the prisoner of that party, not vice versa. But the long-term reasons why it may fail are stronger. First, it is clear - after the DfID decision and the widely trailed scrapping of gender self-identification plans - that Cummings intends to fight a culture war against what the Tory right regard as over-mighty liberal values and institutions. Other battles are likely to include assaults on human rights laws, the supreme court, parliament, the universities and the BBC. Cummings wants to polarise and prosper - posing awkward dilemmas for Labour - as he did over Brexit. And, second, the Tory party cannot make up its mind whether it is a Little England protectionist party or a global, free-trading, buccaneering British party. That divide was never resolved in the leave campaign, and the faultline still runs right down the middle of the government. It is embodied in the potent divides between the party's deregulators and regulators over the US trade treaty - and, of course, over relations with the EU. If Cummings and Johnson get their way, they may try to wage permanent war on both fronts. In the end, though, the changing Tory party may not permit that. Johnson's problem is that there are not enough Tories or Tory voters to prosecute the culture war Cummings wants. Tory under-45s are more liberal on cultural issues, just like their Labour equivalents. So are many of the 140 new and disproportionately young Tory MPs elected in 2019. It may have seemed, after the landslide election, as if Johnson commanded the field. In the real world, landslides are evidence that the ground is often unstable and full of hazard.

"Failure of Brexit talks could lead to terrorism intelligence delays, say Lords",0.5,Positive,"The UK risks losing its real-time access to a watchlist of suspected terrorists if it does not strike a comprehensive Brexit deal on justice and security, peers have been told. The concerns of the policing consequences of a collapse in Brexit talks were raised by members of the Lords EU security and justice sub-committee during questioning of the Home Office minister James Brokenshire. Fears were also raised over the future of the European arrest warrant (EAW) system and the prospect of the UK becoming a haven for foreign criminals trying to evade justice from EU member states. The Labour peer Lord Rowlands described the situation prior to the EAW system as 'hopeless'as it allowed fugitives to roam freely in countries without extradition treaties. 'I hope we will agree that we want to avoid going back to the old system, because it did allow criminal havens; [with] those characters who lived on the Spanish Costa del Sol immune from any formal proceedings. I'm hoping you are not suggesting that we might have to go back to that, are you?'said Rowlands. His concerns came as an ally of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the MEP Nathalie Loiseau, warned that a crash out from the EU without a deal would mean weaker ties on security. Brokenshire said he was optimistic the intensified programme of negotiations scheduled for July and August would deliver a result for both sides. He was confident sense would prevail as there would be 'a mutual loss of capability'in tackling crime and security if negotiations collapsed. Deal or no deal, the UK 'will continue to be a global leader of security and one of the safest countries in the world'with access to Interpol and bilateral intelligence channels, he said. Peers shared his hopes about security but questioned how the UK would fare if it lost its access to real-time information from EU databases. Lord Anderson pointed out police in Dover could currently use handheld devices to get real-time information on passengers from the Schengen Information System (SIS II) database allowing suspects to be 'questioned before they could simply melt away'ù. 'It rather sounds as though the legalistic approach that's being taken to SIS II [in Brexit talks] means that we're not going to have real-time access to data,'said Anderson, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation in the UK between 2011 and 2017. Brokenshire rejected those concerns, pointing out that the UK had only joined SIS II in 2015 and Ireland was not a member of SIS II, suggesting it was possible to run counter-terror operations without access to the Schengen databases. 'I remain optimistic as to what the negotiations in the coming weeks may bring because of, I think, that sense of shared endeavour,'Brokenshire said, adding that the published approach of the UK supported the 'national interest and equally supports those broader interests for the EU security too'ù. British police and border guards were the third heaviest users of the database, accessing it 603m time a year, the committee heard.  Lord Ricketts, a former diplomat and the chair of the committee, questioned the 'coherence'of the UK's Brexit approach. It was looking for a Canada-style agreement in trade but a specially close arrangement in security and justice, 'an equivalent position to that which perhaps Schengen countries have, or EEA countries have like Norway, Iceland but no other country'ù, he said.

Why is Dominic Cummings still in No 10? Because Vote Leavers never say sorry,-0.625,Negative,"Dominic Cummings is a lucky man. A couple of weeks ago, Boris Johnson's chief strategist - and his lockdown-busting trip to north-east England - dominated the news headlines. Now the global outpouring of Black Lives Matter protests and other vital issues in the coronavirus pandemic have captured the news agenda. With the prime minister's vocal support, Cummings still has a job, and the world seems to have moved on.But Cummings's continued presence at the heart of the British government is not just down to luck, of course. Johnson's special adviser has probably the most valuable asset in Downing Street right now: the unswerving loyalty of the Vote Leave campaign that now holds the key levers of power in British politics. On paper, Vote Leave disappeared almost four years ago. Having won the Brexit referendum, the campaign packed up its spartan office beside Lambeth Bridge. Cummings left politics to advise an artificial intelligence startup (which subsequently won lots of NHS contracts, but that's another story). But Vote Leave hasn't gone away, you know. After the Brexit vote, the European Research Group - instrumental in torpedoing Theresa May's ill-fated premiership - often resembled the parliamentary wing of Vote Leave. When Johnson, Vote Leave's public face, came to power last July his first significant act was to bring in a large swath of the campaign's backroom operation into the heart of his new administration: from Cummings as his right-hand man to Lee Cain as Downing Street's truculent head of communications. All the great offices of state are now held by Brexit true believers, from Priti Patel to Dominic Raab.† Why does any of this matter? Well, for one thing, now that Vote Leave has managed to take control of government - and looks set to take us to the brink of a no-deal Brexit, again - many of its ranks are worried about what would happen if their eminence grise were not around to oversee the project. As one Vote Leave figure told†the Sunday Times†when asked about jettisoning Cummings: 'We need him. We took three years to get the gang in there. We can't throw that away now.'ù†The level of faith in Cummings in some sections of government borders on the messianic.  It might seem hard to understand from his public persona, but Cummings is clearly capable of engendering great loyalty. When I was researching my new book on money and power in British politics, I spoke to a number of people in and around Vote Leave. The most striking thing was how more junior staff, in particular, saw Cummings as their defender. 'He always had your back,'one told me. 'If you supported him.'In government, Cummings has made such loyalty paramount. Those accused of leaking to the press have been frog-marched out of office. Under Cummings, Downing Street has become a permanent campaign machine.†Often, responding to the pandemic has been treated like the referendum: a media narrative to managed by any means necessary, no matter how brazen or cynical. (Of course, there is an all-too-real difference between £350m on the side of a bus and opening a†patently unready track and trace system to deflect political heat.) It is tempting to see Vote Leave and Cummings as synonymous. Why else would Johnson invest so much political capital in his special adviser if he was not pulling all the strings? He remains in post now largely because the Vote Leave fraternity worries about how it would replace a man who masterminded the Brexit vote and Johnson's 'stonking majority'in the December general election. The belligerent style of politics practised by Vote Leave has even allowed the prime minister to ignore public opinion of Cummings. But such a narrow framing around Johnson's senior adviser risks ignoring wider developments in government, where a grander cast of Vote Leave figures has become increasingly influential. Michael Gove has centralised a significant amount of power at the Cabinet Office. In a sign of the department's growing muscle, one-time Vote Leave†stalwarts Gisela Stuart and Henry de Zoete were quietly brought into the Cabinet Office as non-executive directors last month. Vote Leave famously declined to sketch out even the faintest outline of post-Brexit Britain, but the contours of its project in government can start to be divined. Control needs to be concentrated in the centre. Whitehall needs to be torn down. The public sector is considered inherently inefficient,†and untrustworthy. Gove's Cabinet Office is instructive. The department has played a central role in Britain's Covid-19 response - mostly by outsourcing every conceivable aspect of it†. When Deloitte was hired to oversee the procurement of personal protective equipment, the consultancy firm even set up a unit in the Cabinet Office. The results could most generously be described as patchy. A Vote Leave government - as embodied by Cummings - cares little for institutions and precedents. Executive power tramples all before it. With this mindset, we've seen parliament prorogued in an attempt to deliver political objectives, even if doing so was illegal. Transparency and accountability are considered mere liberal buzzwords - they are not essential to governing. Electoral laws, like lockdown rules, are for other people to follow.† The revelations about Cummings's lockdown drive to Durham emerged three weeks ago. The question of whether he will leave Downing Street has begun to fade away, but one day Cummings and his cadre will be gone. This ultimately poses a bigger question: what will the British state - and society - look like when the Vote Leave state of mind is no longer in power?

Donald Trump's Tory cheerleaders have brought lasting shame on Britain,-0.875,Negative,"The morning after Donald Trump's election in November 2016, a Conservative minister bounded up to me in Westminster's New Palace Yard to share one of the worst political predictions I have ever heard: 'It'll be fine,'he said with triumph. 'You'll see. He'll govern as an Eisenhower-style Republican.'It is not fine and Eisenhower's legacy is nowhere to be seen, except perhaps in the action of those generals who warned their president not to use military force against peaceful protests. Tories who relished Trump's ascent are now silent. Many will deny that they supported him and some will even believe that. Shame drives out awkward memories and scrubs consciences clean. That is trickier for those who put their enthusiasm on the record. None outdid Michael Gove, comparing Trump to George Washington. The first president had also been misunderstood by Britain, Gove wrote in an unctuous interview with the 45th. He cast Trump as a 'force of nature'who did not merit the 'scorn and condescension'of his UK critics.†To compensate for his countrymen's discourtesy, Gove posed with his subject, grinning and giving the thumbs-up. In the gallery of cringing subservience that image can hang alongside Theresa May holding the president's hand during her first visit to the White House. Later that day, Trump issued executive order 13769 - the entry ban on nationals from predominantly Muslim countries. May did not condemn it. Some said there was a better man behind the mask, but there was no mask. The racist snarl, the bully's sneer and the infantile pout were all his. The face of the campaign was true to the character of the candidate. The only way to see a nobler Trump was to mould one from delusion, cowardice and self-interest - plentiful resources in a government embarking on Brexit. Those who found Trump's appeals to white nationalism a little vulgar retreated to arguments based on realpolitik. The transatlantic relationship is bigger than personalities, they said. We honour the office of president, regardless of who sits there. That diplomatic rationale led Britain to roll out what Jacob Rees-Mogg boasted should be 'the reddest of red carpets'for a state visit. The problem is that Trump is a malignancy eating away at the authority of his office. He has no concept of alliances based on mutual interest. Like any despot, he demands submission, then despises as weaklings those who submit. Britain's loyalty should be to the institutions of liberal democracy in the US and around the world that Trump attacks. Angela Merkel got the tone right. The German chancellor's message marking Trump's victory was more†rebuke†than congratulation. She itemised the ethical foundations of partnership between democracies, 'the rule of law and the dignity of each and every person, regardless of their origin, skin colour, creed, gender, sexual orientation, or political views'ù. She offered cooperation 'based on these values'ù. Back in Westminster, giddy Brexiteers scoffed at Merkel's piety, which they took as a symptom of strategic decline. New power alignments were coming into focus, the old order was unravelling and Berlin was disadvantaged by its lack of a 'special relationship'with the US. Forget Brussels, London had Washington on its side. The chancellor's critics underestimated her own capacity for hard-headed realpolitik. She identifies Germany's interests with the European Union as part of the broad apparatus of international rules-based cooperation. When Trump hurls aggressive rhetoric at those structures, when he calls the EU a 'foe'ù, when he lavishes praise on authoritarian rulers, Merkel listens. She does not gamble on apologist interpretations of what he really meant to say.There is a certain type of squeamish Trump fellow-traveller who, embarrassed by displays of actual fascism, draws a distinction between taking the president†literally†and taking him†seriously. It is a clever formula, usually attributed to the libertarian tech billionaire Peter Thiel, but probably not coined by him. This rhetorical device is used to exonerate people who rally to hateful language on the grounds that they are responding to some deeper meaning. The thuggish misogyny and racist provocations are just short-cuts, like icons on a desktop leading to a more sophisticated program. By a feat of moral gymnastics, the nastiness could then be justified as empathic rage, expressing the legitimate concerns of humble Americans, traduced by metropolitan globalists.But Trump despises the people who elected him. His economic policy transfers their money into the pockets of his family and friends. He befouled American public administration, leaving the country defenceless against Covid-19. It is the stuff of banal kleptocracy, but a vanguard of ideologues and broadsheet media outriders dressed it up to seem complex, profound and somehow historically inevitable.The narrative of popular grievance seeded the liberal calamity with guilt - a burden of self-criticism placed on the losers for neglecting the terrain where Trumpism flourished. A necessary stage, perhaps, to understand electoral forces in play, but then what? The ultimate task was still resisting a tyrant.And what did the Tory party do, meanwhile, but jostle among the sycophants and courtiers seeking favours, kidding themselves that they had influence. They shredded European alliances to make confetti for a venal egomaniac's parade, cheered by the world's autocrats who knew the grotesque carnival route led away from law and order.† And what is the reward for Britain? If Trump is defeated in November, the last four years are nothing but a stain on transatlantic relations. If Trump stays, the only global role for Boris Johnson is dishevelled sidekick to a rogue superpower. Either way there is a price to pay for collusion. History will record that Britain was no mere bystander at America's tragedy, nor was it innocent. '¢ Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist ",0.25,Positive
The coronavirus crisis won't give Boris Johnson an alibi for a calamitous Brexit,-1,Negative,"Britain, an island state highly dependent on imported food, has been lucky not to go hungry during the coronavirus crisis. At the outset of the emergency, when a loo roll was harder to find than a bar of gold bullion, I detected considerable fear among officials and ministers that panic buying would clean out supermarkets and spark food riots. Some of them†remembered the old saw that anarchy is only three missed meals away.† That ugly scenario, which would have added civil disorder to killer contagion, was avoided because supply chains have been protected. Cargo ships and lorry drivers have continued to make deliveries from our neighbours in Europe. Even as borders were closed to most other traffic, everyone came to the sensible conclusion that frontiers had to remain open for freight. For the same reason, the new 14-day quarantine rule that the government is imposing on travellers will not be applied to those hauling goods. Tariff-free and frictionless trade have played vital roles in enduring this emergency. And thanks for that is due to Britain's membership of the European Union. I doubt you will ever get anyone from Boris Johnson's Brexiter government to acknowledge this, but the EU helped to prevent the crisis from becoming even more diabolical. Though the UK formally left at the end of January, this made little practical difference to trade because we entered a†transition period during which Britain has continued to enjoy the benefits of the single market. We cannot know when the coronavirus will go away. We do know that the transition expires at the end of this year. If there's no trade deal with the EU by then, Britain will be hurled into 2021 with price-inflating duties on imports, serious burdens on exporters and friction-heavy checks at borders. Brexit ultras are trying to make that sound like a benign scenario by rebadging it as an 'Australian-style'outcome, but this would be no picnic on Bondi beach. The CBI says that the coronavirus has left companies with 'almost zero'resilience to a chaotic exit from the single market. Most analysis suggests that the hardest hit regions would be those where many voted Tory for the first time in 2019. Nissan has just warned that it could not guarantee the future of its car plant in Sunderland. The Bank of England is telling financial institutions to be prepared. The International Monetary Fund estimates that a no-deal Brexit would compound the coronavirus havoc by inflicting further scarring on the economy and a permanent loss of 5% of GDP. For many companies fighting to keep their heads above water in a virus-induced recession, a crash-out of the single market will be like fitting concrete overshoes to a man who is already close to drowning.† Why then is such a horrific double-whammy even conceivable? Four rounds of talks with Brussels have gone badly and Boris Johnson†has set an adamant face against asking for an extension to the transition. Negotiations by videolink are not a satisfactory substitute for meeting face to face. As one veteran of bargaining with Brussels says: 'You can't have those quiet, informal corridor conversations where you say, 'òIf we give a bit on this point, can you give something on that point?''There might be a chance of overcoming that handicap with goodwill, but the talks have been characterised by†mutual distrust, grandstanding and temper tantrums.† Each side accuses the other of being unreasonable. The EU is right that the Johnson government has been backsliding on commitments made in the withdrawal agreement, behaviour that has deepened their pre-existing suspicions of a British prime minister who†caused enduring offence by comparing the EU to Nazi prison guards. The British government is right that some of the EU's demands, especially on fisheries and state aid, are too aggressive.† The rawest complaint from London is that the EU is treating Britain as a supplicant rather than an 'equal'sovereign state.†The EU retorts that the Johnson government is not, as it claims to be, seeking a free trade agreement, but demanding the right to cherry-pick privileged access to the single market.† Both sides now sound resigned to the idea that there's no chance of an agreement before October, perilously close to the cliff edge. Number 10 is making†noises that the negotiations need to be taken to a higher level by engaging heads of government. The trouble is that European leaders are bored stiff with Brexit and the coronavirus crisis has pushed it further down their list of priorities.† EU leaders are also bound to ask themselves whether a British government heavily populated with some of the most hardline Brexiters wants the negotiations to succeed anyway. They can hear the faction of Tory ultras who argue that no deal the EU will ever offer can be a deal worth having. In the cabinet, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, and Priti Patel, the home secretary, are among ministers who lean in that direction. A crash-out was emphatically not what was promised when Brexit was sold to the public with the reassurance that negotiating a trade agreement with the EU would be a 'piece of cake'ù.†At the December election, Mr Johnson told the British people that he had an 'oven-ready deal'ù. What we get now from his kitchen is the smell of something burning. Some people close to the prime minister have been telling their friends in the media that this breach of trust won't matter because the economic damage will be masked by and can be blamed on that caused by the disease. This is like telling a man who has been deprived of both his arms that he won't notice losing his legs as well. This theory is unconvincing even to many Tories. As one former cabinet minister remarks: 'We'll most likely be in a terrible recession at the turn of the year and you'll have bankrupted businesses popping up saying this was the last straw. They'd say they had managed to survive the coronavirus, only to be killed by a crash-out of the single market.'The view that this would be crazy has some representation around the cabinet table. A few moderate voices survived the purge of the Remainers that Mr Johnson conducted when he became prime minister.†Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, is one of the residual sensibles in the cabinet. So probably is Matt Hancock, but the health secretary has other things to worry about at the moment. The most intriguing figure is the chancellor. Rishi Sunak was a keen Brexiter, but the Treasury as an institution is appalled by the prospect of a no-deal outcome and colleagues suspect that Mr Sunak has lost any enthusiasm he might once have had. The chancellor borrowed more than £60bn in April alone to pour funds into business support programmes and job retention schemes. A lot of that money will be squandered if a crash-out then pushes many businesses under anyway. Some observers say that it doesn't really matter how the cabinet splits because it doesn't really matter what the cabinet thinks. 'Most of them will just nod along to whatever Boris decides to do,'predicts one senior Tory. Some argue that the prime minister genuinely wants a deal, but believes that the way to get to it is to play hardball. It was his consistent critique of Theresa May and David Cameron that they got lousy offers from the EU because they were never prepared to threaten to walk away. It is contended that a tight deadline and a tough stance will force concessions from the EU. 'They'll be desperate for a deal by the autumn,'claims one senior Brexiter. Did he not, say Mr Johnson's cheerleaders, confound all the doubters last autumn when the EU agreed to rewrite the deal it had signed with Mrs May? Yes, there was a change to the agreement, but not because Mr Johnson is a genius at brinkmanship. He got a deal by making an almighty concession on the Irish backstop, which, as the government belatedly conceded under the cover of the coronavirus crisis, puts a regulatory border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.  This prime minister has a flair for putting a boastful face on failures to keep his promises - witness his 'world-beating'handling of the epidemic - but it fools only those who don't bother to check the fine print. It would be madness for Britain and bad for the EU not to reach an agreement. Where there's a will, there's a way. There's a way. The question is whether there's the will. If there's not, a crisis triggered by a microbe will be calamitously compounded by a disaster that will be entirely manmade.† '¢ Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer ",1.375,Positive
An unjust and undemocratic Tory power grab,-0.625,Negative,"As a Conservative voter of, until recently, 37 years' standing, I am appalled at what has been done by the leader of the house (MPs join 90-minute-long queue to vote to end virtual voting, 2 June). It is so obviously and completely wrong, unfair, unjust and anti-democratic, with scenes reminiscent of voter suppression in the US, where voters in gerrymandered states often have to queue for up to five hours to vote, and with those MPs being disenfranchised not even being allowed a vote on the matter, in the manner of a coup d'Ètat. There can therefore only be one conceivable reason for it: to avoid debate in parliament, and to reduce opportunities for ministers to be held to account - especially, I assume, the PM, whose performances have been appalling and who is the one most in need of being 'shielded'from scrutiny - and as a power grab by the executive at a critical time. This measure undermines all that the Conservative party is supposed to stand for. It was also wrong that a measure so fundamentally affecting our democratic process should be whipped through by the government, again suggesting it was done for partisan political advantage. This makes me fear for our democracy, and I very much hope that the courts will be able to overturn it. It makes clear what those who spoke so often of 'taking back control'meant: not returning sovereignty to parliament, but seizing power for themselves.Adrian CoskerHitchin, Hertfordshire '¢ Despite warnings from the Equality and Human Rights Commission that it cannot be right to exclude elected representatives from parliament, MPs voted on Tuesday to end online voting by those MPs shut out from Westminster by this pandemic. This is an outrageous attack on our parliamentary democracy by a failed government elected on the falsehood of an 'oven-ready'Brexit, when it becomes clearer by the day that they intend to go for no-deal at disastrous cost to the national interest. This amounts to a conspiracy led by Jacob Rees-Mogg to exclude the representatives of thousands of voters from crucial decisions made by parliament that will affect our future for years to come. Having manifestly failed to prevent thousands of unnecessary deaths as a result of their tardy response to this pandemic, this failed government can only cling to office by destroying democracy.Margaret Phelps Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan '¢ In 2017, the May government launched its industrial strategy with the laudable aim of investing in research and development in businesses to improve our national productivity.

The Guardian view on the EU and Covid-19: better late than never,-0.375,Negative,"Almost seven weeks after the World Health Organization confirmed the pandemic, Europe remains in the frontline of the battle to contain the Covid-19 virus. Five of the six countries reporting most cases are in Europe. Seven of the 10 countries reporting most deaths are in our continent too. Yet Europe has struggled to make common cause against the virus. In particular, it has bickered over how to support the most affected European economies against the consequences of the lockdown. In spite of innumerable acts of cross-border solidarity on the medical front, the rich nations of Europe have proved reluctant backers of the continent's embattled poorer economies. The good news, relatively speaking, is that this divide has not got worse and may, just possibly, have eased a little. This week, leaders of the 27 EU nations finally signed off on a £540bn rescue package. This gives countries such as Italy and Spain, which stand second and third to the United States in Covid-19 cases and deaths, the right to borrow from the eurozone's bailout mechanism. The problem is that the EU's southern member states are reluctant to borrow their way out of the problem, in part because they fear that to take on more debt would deepen the inequality between the EU's south and north. Instead, France and the southern member states want the EU to make financial transfers to its worst-affected members. Some rich states, notably Germany, balk at this. All of them, though, want to avoid a prolongation of the EU's damaging divisions of March and early April. As a result, the EU27 decided on Thursday that they would pass the parcel to Ursula von der Leyen and the European commission, who have been tasked with creating a recovery fund alongside the EU's next seven-year budget, which is required by the start of 2021. No figures have yet been agreed, but the recovery fund device could prove a smart way of allowing the EU and its richer member states to stand by the poorer ones. In Thursday's virtual summit, Angela Merkel said that Germany, already the EU budget's largest net contributor, would make a significantly higher contribution 'in the spirit of solidarity'ù. Ms von der Leyen said afterwards that the EU would be trying to create a funding mechanism that allowed for a balance of grants and loans. This will be anything but easy. Familiar disputes about the size of the EU budget have not disappeared. Indeed, the UK's departure had made them trickier. Now, in time-honoured fashion, the EU has also kicked the can down the road over the recovery fund. But it cannot do that for long. Ms von der Leyen has only weeks to come up with a package. The package is likely to be enormous. But the economic damage caused by the pandemic means this issue is urgent and could still pose existential questions, as Emmanuel Macron said this week, for the EU itself. This is a huge moment for the EU. But it has direct implications for Britain too. If the Brexit transition was to be extended into 2021, the UK would have to extend its budget contribution too. It is hard to see the current British government contributing to the EU recovery fund as well. Yet there are no easy choices for any government in the wake of the pandemic shutdown. The EU may be divided over the economic response. But if the choice for Britain lies between cooperation with a divided EU and cooperation with a United States led by a delinquent president who advocates ingesting disinfectant, it would be a no-brainer.

Matt Hancock forced to deny 'òpolitical' opt-out from EU ventilators,-0.25,Negative,"The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been forced to deny explosive claims by a civil servant at the top of government that ministers made a 'òpolitical decision' to opt out of an EU scheme to bulk-buy ventilators and protective equipment for NHS workers. Following comments to a select committee by the Foreign Office's permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, Hancock used Downing Street's daily press briefing to rebut the damaging claims which risk accusations that ministers have put Brexit ideology ahead of people's lives. 'I have spoken to the foreign secretary,'Hancock said an hour after McDonald's remarks, which he retracted on Tuesday night. 'As far as I'm aware there was no political decision not to participate. 'We did receive an invitation in the Department of Health and it was put up to me to be asked and we joined so we are now members of that scheme.'However, a spokesman for the European commission swiftly rebutted any suggestion that the UK was currently involved in any of the EU's efforts to buy masks, gowns, ventilators or laboratory supplies. 'They are most welcome to participate in future rounds,'the spokesman said. The EU launched four rounds of procurement of personal protective equipment, ventilators and laboratory supplies in late February and March. UK officials failed to take up an invitation to join the steering committee of participating countries that issues orders for medical equipment until 19 March - after the bulk purchases had been made. When Downing Street has previously been questioned about the lack of involvement, officials and ministers have said the government failed to take part in the schemes because 'owing to an initial communication problem, the UK did not receive an invitation in time'ù. But when asked on Tuesday by the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat, whether there had been policy advice on whether to participate in the EU ventilator scheme, the FCO's most senior mandarin appeared to contradict the government line. McDonald told the committee: 'It was a political decision. The UK mission in Brussels briefed ministers about what was available, what was on offer, and the decision is known.'His remarks appeared to blow a hole in the original defence of a 'communication confusion'previously put forward by the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove. McDonald had earlier been asked by the Labour MP Chris Bryant: 'Why oh why did we not take part in the EU ventilator procurement scheme?'He replied: 'The UK declined to participate because we left the European Union on 31 January.'Bryant replied: 'No, we were invited to take part apparently, we missed the emails or forgot the emails.'At this point McDonald insisted that ministers had been fully briefed. In a 'clarificatory'letter to the foreign affairs select committee on Tuesday night, McDonald said that unfortunately due to a misunderstanding he had mistakenly and wrongly told the committee that a political decision had been taken not to be involved in the EU joint procurement scheme. He wrote: 'Ministers were not briefed by our mission in Brussels about the scheme and a political decision was not taken whether or not to participate. Owing to an initial communication problem the UK did not receive an invitation in time to join four EU joint Covid joint procurement schemes. As these four initial schemes had already gone out to tender we were unable to take part.'Hancock's claim to have given the green light to joining the procurement scheme appeared to be a reference to the belated decision on 19 March to be represented on the key committee making the orders of equipment. He told reporters at the daily press briefing that he did not believe that any equipment under the EU scheme had yet been delivered. EU sources said they expected the first deliveries of £1.5bn (£1.3bn) worth of protective gear within days. McDonald's claim that he made an error in giving evidence to the committee is remarkable, given that he is the senior civil servant responsible for handling UK relations with the EU, and the controversy over UK involvement in the EU medical schemes had been widely aired in the media.  At the end of his evidence session McDonald had also taken the chance to correct a separate minor error in his evidence, but clearly had been given no guidance that he had wrongly briefed the select committee over the EU medical equipment schemes since he made no attempt to correct the record. Speaking after the hearing, Bryant said he had been shocked by McDonald's answer, adding: 'It seems that not content with refusing to take part in a mass EU purchase of desperately needed vital equipment out of a fit of Eurosceptic pique, the government has repeatedly told fibs in a sad attempt to cover its tracks.'He added: 'It beggars belief that they deliberately, intentionally, with forethought and against advice, decided not to take part. And that they trotted out every excuse in the book when they realised they had messed up.'In recent days the UK has seen a sudden sharp increase in Covid-19 infection numbers, leading to fears that a second wave of cases is beginning. Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the†1918 influenza pandemic†that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated - albeit more mildly - in subsequent flu pandemics. Until now that had been what was expected from Covid-19. How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity. Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave? This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden†resurgence in infections†despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak. Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in†cramped dormitory accommodation†used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens. Singapore's experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it. In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions. What are experts worried about? Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies. However Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, says ''òSecond wave' isn't a term that we would use at the current time, as the virus hasn't gone away, it's in our population, it has spread to 188 countries so far, and what we are seeing now is essentially localised spikes or a localised return of a large number of cases.'ù† The overall threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available. In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with†a vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves. Peter Beaumont,†Emma Graham-Harrison and Martin Belam McDonald also spoke to the committee about the end of the transition period for the UK to leave the EU at the end of the year, apparently raising the possibility that Boris Johnson would consider in the next few weeks whether to go for an extension of the deadline. However, he then seemed to step back from the startling suggestion, saying he was stressing the theoretical possibilities, and adding that he believed the prime minister would confirm the existing timetable.  Commenting on conversations with the US following Donald Trump's decision to suspend payments to the World Health Organization, McDonald said: 'It is clear that they think the WHO is overloaded and there needs to be a separate space for pandemics.'What is the World Health Organization's remit? The World Health Organization (WHO) was founded as the UN global health body in 1948 in the aftermath of the second world war with a mandate to†promote global health,†protect against infectious disease and to serve the vulnerable.† Its current programme envisages expanding universal healthcare to a billion more people, protecting another billion from health emergencies and providing a further billion people with better health and wellbeing. What does that involve? The WHO acts as a clearing house for investigation, data and technical recommendations on emerging disease threats such as the coronavirus and Ebola. It also supports eradication of existing diseases such as malaria and polio and promotes global public health. While its role on emerging diseases is most familiar in the developed world, its practical involvement is far more marked in the global south, where it has been working to expand basic healthcare, support vaccination and sustain weak and often stressed health systems through its emergencies programmes.† Why is the WHO under fire from Trump? Trump has presented withdrawing funding and cutting ties with WHO as a direct response to what he claims was its slow reaction in raising the alarm over the global threat from the coronavirus and being too 'China-centric'in its response. The allegation that the WHO was slow to warn of the risk of human-to-human transmission, and that it failed to cross-examine Chinese transparency early on, is largely not borne out by the evidence. And the organisation's funding was already in his sights on 7 February,†when his administration was suggesting cutting the US contribution†by half. The WHO, to whom the US theoretically contributes roughly 10-15% of its budget as its largest contributor, has been appealing for an extra $1bn to help fight the coronavirus. While the suspension of funding by the US for 60-90 days is relatively small - not least because the US is so far in arrears in its annual payments - a general US withdrawal from global health funding under the cover of this announcement would be very serious and felt most profoundly in places that need the most support. Peter Beaumont†and†Sarah Boseley McDonald also said an 'unacceptably large number of British people'stranded overseas had felt let down by the calibre of aid provided by the FCO. He conceded that cost-saving had driven the decision to require British nationals to use commercial as opposed to chartered flights to return home, but said the decision was good and defensible.  He accepted the FCO had not initially been equipped at its central call centre to help Britons stranded abroad. But he insisted the department had received more praise than criticism for its efforts, by a margin of 20 to one. ",0.375,Positive
Applause for NHS was bittersweet,0.375,Positive,"The mass clapping event (Millions of Britons clap for carers on coronavirus frontline, 26 March) was bittersweet and loaded with irony. It was an unprecedented show of collective gratitude, inspired by a Dutch woman living in the UK, by a nation whose Brexit vote caused a shortage of medical staff as it sent EU citizens away. A clapping nation whose government created a 'hostile environment'to banish the Windrush generation, who made vital contributions to the NHS. I also thought of supermarket workers on low wages now risking life and limb, generally with no gloves or masks. There is little consideration for their safety. If it weren't for them we would not be eating. The clap was a show of appreciation by a public that elected a government that has been rapidly privatising the very service we were applauding. But it also showed the nation's longstanding and deepening love for the NHS, and acknowledged our dependency on it. The clap strangely transcended the bitter rows of the last few years. It expressed a rare but precious sense of community.Corinne FowlerBirmingham ",-0.75,Negative
Labour anger over Chris Grayling's appointment to intelligence committee,0.875,Positive,"Labour has demanded that Boris Johnson rethink plans to appoint Chris Grayling to the powerful intelligence and security committee, one of a group of Brexiter Conservatives who will have the final say over whether to release the long-delayed report on Russian influence in UK politics. Nia Griffith, the party's defence spokesperson, said that previous chairs of the special committee 'have been highly qualified and experienced'and 'not frightened of criticising the government where and when necessary'ù. But the Labour MP added that she doubted whether Grayling was sufficiently expert to take on the role, citing 'his track record of failure'as transport secretary and justice secretary - and called on the prime minister to 'immediately rethink'ù. The former transport secretary is one of several Tory grandees whose names have emerged as in the frame to be appointed to the watchdog, prompting alarm in Westminster and Whitehall circles. Others include Theresa Villiers, who was environment secretary until the recent reshuffle, and Sir John Hayes, another leave supporter, who would be among nine MPs and peers determining how and whether to release the Russia report. Westminster insiders reacted with dismay at the possibility of Grayling becoming chairman. One Conservative MP said: 'He doesn't have a clue and is likely to be supportive of the government, not critical.'One Whitehall veteran expressed outrage, writing an expletive in a text. Grayling is best known as an error-prone minister who presided over the collapse of Northern and Thameslink rail services and the granting of a no-deal Brexit ferry contract to a company with no ships. As justice secretary, he part-privatised the probation service and banned prisoners from receiving books from relatives - a measure that was overturned in the courts. He was also a prominent supporter of leave in the 2016 referendum campaign. Labour have claimed that while he was in government Chris Grayling's mistakes cost the economy and taxpayers over £2.7bn. Here are five of Grayling's biggest failings: B&B gay comments In 2010 Grayling was forced to apologise after a recording captured him saying that people who ran bed and breakfasts in their homes should have the right to turn away gay couples.† Banning books for prisoners Grayling introduced a ban on prisoners receiving books from friends or relatives, and limited the number of books each prisoner was able to have in a cell. A high court ruling in December 2015 found that the measure was unlawful†and it was subsequently scrapped. Rail timetable chaos Grayling was transport secretary when†a change to rail timetables caused chaos, leading to the cancellation of thousands of services. More than one in 10 Northern and Thameslink trains were cancelled after the introduction of the new timetables on 20 May 2018. The rail regulator criticised Grayling's DfT for failing to question the industry's assurances about the risk of disruption. Seaborne Freight Grayling was widely mocked after awarding Seaborne Freight a no-deal Brexit ferry contract despite the company not owning any ships and having never previously operated a ferry service.†It emerged that Seaborne's website had copied their legal terms and conditions from a pizza delivery service. The contract was cancelled in February 2019. The government subsequently had to agree a new £33m contract with Eurotunnel to settle legal action. Part-privatisation of probation contracts Failings by the Ministry of Justice in the part-privatisation of probation services will cost taxpayers at least £171m, according to a National Audit Office (NAO). Under Grayling, in 2013, the ministry created 21 community rehabilitation companies (CRCs) to manage low- and medium-risk offenders with the aim of cutting reoffending rates and costs. The NAO found that while there has been a 2.5% reduction in the proportion of offenders proven to have committed another crime between 2011 and March 2017, the number of offences per reoffender has increased by 22%. Haroon Siddique Downing Street is expected to appoint five Conservative members to the committee, with Grayling's appointment described as 'nailed on'ù.Other names mentioned as in the running include Mike Penning and Bernard Jenkin. Labour will have a maximum of three and the Scottish National party one. Once selected, the nine members will elect a chair, with a high-profile MP such as Grayling well placed if the Conservative members can agree. Some fear that if the committee has a Brexiter majority it could have an incentive to re-edit the Russia report, which looks at Kremlin influence in British politics, including the impact of meddling in the EU referendum. Dominic Grieve, who chaired the committee in the last parliament, has said the new members should release the report, which has been written, finalised and cleared, without delay once they start sitting - which could yet take a couple of months. 'I urge the new members to publish the report as soon as they can,'Grieve said, although he said he expected new members to brief themselves on its contents before it was published and publicly debated. Downing Street was accused of suppressing the Russia report in the run-up to the election. It had been completed and cleared by the spy agencies, but Boris Johnson refused to sign it off until after he won an overall majority in December, prompting accusations that it made for awkward reading for the Conservatives. No 10 insiders, however, insist that the report is far less contentious than political critics have suggested. The report was cleared after the election by Johnson, leaving the decisions over its final release to the new committee. This week, the Guardian published some of the evidence received by the committee, from Bill Browder, an anti-corruption campaigner. He accused Russia of hiring a network of British politicians and consultants to help advance its criminal interests and to 'go after'Vladimir Putin's enemies in London. ",-0.25,Negative
Will the new immigration system detoxify the issue? It depends on the media,0.125,Positive,"And just like that, it was done. Britain put itself through years of political crisis, economic stagnation and social division, all to end the free movement of people within the European Union. Like a nation selling the family silver to fund a search for a lost tenner, we could finally brandish our successfully retrieved banknote while the neighbours looked on in bemusement. But already most people will have forgotten the announcement. No mention of it remains in the dailies. New threats and worries emerge. The news cycle moves on. Anyone could be forgiven for thinking it never even mattered. Priti Patel's points-based immigration system is, as it stands, liable to cause havoc in sectors such as social care and hospitality. It also ends the free movement of the British ourselves: by cancelling the automatic right of EU citizens to live and work here, it means that our right to do likewise in the EU also ends. It is nevertheless likely to enjoy strong public support, particularly from leave voters. Vote Leave promised to 'take back control'ù, and in this sense - and, chances are, this sense alone - the government is delivering. The public wanted direct controls on EU immigration, and now they're getting them. Consequences are for losers. Will this finally extinguish immigration as a public sore point? Is it even a sore point any more, given recent shifts in public opinion? And if not, why are we doing this at such cost to ourselves? The trend line of British attitudes to immigration is not a simple one. Concerns over immigration were almost nonexistent in the 1990s but shot up in the early 2000s around hysterical coverage of the Sangatte refugee camp in France, and then rose further after the rise in migration that followed the expansion of the EU in 2004. While the issue subsided as a voter priority in the years following the financial crisis, it never truly went away, and shot up again amid frenzied coverage of Romanian and Bulgarian immigration in 2014 and then the Syrian refugee crisis in 2014 and 2015. The 2016 leave campaign was built on racist scaremongering over immigration - Syrian refugees, Turkish membership of the EU. Nigel Farage and Dominic Cummings both shamelessly exploited the Cologne sexual assaults to claim Britain's EU membership meant it could happen here. Plainly, this is not just about what political types call 'lived experience'ù. While New Labour housed asylum-seekers in deprived areas, where they became a lightning rod for local hostility, the overall public opposition to immigration in the early 2000s cannot be divorced from the blanket media coverage of the Sangatte camp at the time. Similarly, 2013 saw widespread coverage of the imminent lifting of restrictions on immigration from Bulgaria and Romania, with a predicted surge in migration that never came to pass. The number of people 'concerned'about Syrian refugees was infinitely larger than the number of people who were ever likely to meet one. This not to say that direct experience of immigration justifies negative attitudes - it is simply to show that media coverage has a significant influence on public opinion. Only since the referendum has public opposition to immigration softened - although even then, large numbers still support cuts to immigration. In 2011, nearly two-thirds of Britons thought immigration had been bad for the country according to one polling firm - by 2019 that had fallen to barely a quarter. There are various reasons for this shift. Brexit may have satisfied leave voters that immigration will fall or at least be 'under control'- though that doesn't explain why more people think immigration has been good, and fewer think it's been bad. Instead there is evidence that media coverage of the forecast impact of post-Brexit immigration controls, including health and care staff shortages, and fruit going rotten on farms - has increased public understanding and acceptance of the role of immigration. A year ago, Ipsos Mori found most of those who had become more positive about immigration had done so because 'discussions'about Brexit - presumably in the media rather than at the watercooler - had 'highlighted how much immigrants contribute to the UK'ù. Given that many remain voters actually wanted controls on immigration in 2016 - 55% of them in a NatCen poll that November - this shows both the impact of media coverage and the failings of the remain campaign itself in the runup to the referendum. How many column inches, we may ask, were devoted to the prospect of Turkish membership four years ago? And did pro-EU politicians really make the case for free movement, not just during the campaign itself but in the years before it? But it also reflects that economic arguments are central to the softening of attitudes to immigration. Like most countries - white-majority or otherwise - Britain is not automatically welcoming of outsiders. It is too soon to extrapolate from this that there is a fundamental acceptance of immigration as a 'good'in and of itself. Antipathy towards immigrants claiming benefits or using the NHS remains high. Future waves of migration may be met with the same wall of hostility as previous ones. The government may find it politically easy to loosen its points-based criteria to address staff shortages in the care sector, for example - Boris Johnson has the trust of leave voters, and adult care is a frontline service facing widely documented challenges. Should the new criteria fail to bring down immigration levels, will voters be riled, resigned or find it wholly irrelevant? The debate that followed the announcement of the new rules veered between those who feel reducing actual numbers is key, and those who argue that the concept of 'control'is enough to assuage public concerns. But what really counts will be media coverage. Say, for example, that after three years of the points-based system, immigration levels are still rising. Imagine two different scenarios. In the first, rising immigration is being blared out on the front pages of national newspapers, breathlessly debated on the BBC and going viral via the internet's outrage-industrial complex. In the second, it isn't - instead it's just treated as a normal and fairly unexciting statistic. Is public opinion the same in both scenarios? Of course not. But all this may seem quaint in years to come. Should the government's handling of Brexit end up gutting the economy, the surge across the border may be from people heading out, not coming in.

"Joanna Trollope on families, fiction and feminism: 'òSociety still expects women to do all the caring'",-0.125,Negative,"òHere they are in the ruins of what once looked like a bold and adventurous dream. One stroke and, crash, the whole house of cards collapses. No wonder they're frightened.'Since her parents live in Spain, Katie could be talking about the Brexit debacle but, as she is a character in a Joanna Trollope novel, her concerns are less about big political shifts and more about issues closer to home. They are the worries of any daughter squashed between the demands of elderly parents and young children. Trollope is the queen of contemporary women's fiction and seems to be wired to the anxieties of a devoted, predominantly female, readership. The complexities of life and love cascade through novels that have confronted lust, adoption, divorce, infidelity and the changing nature of the modern family. In 2018's An Unsuitable Match, she dealt with remarriage late in life. The previous year's City of Friends explored friendship among middle-aged women with careers, while in 2013 she brought Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility into the age of YouTube trolling and Taylor Swift. But it is intergenerational relationships that are at the top of her mind. She is fresh off a train from Edinburgh, where she saw one of her nine grandchildren in a student production of a musical. 'He brought such poignancy to it. It was really very, very moving, seeing the vulnerability and the overcoming of it as well,'she says. 'Bringing up your own children, you're too close to it. You don't see the fragility as you do when you're a grandparent.'Her latest novel, Mum & Dad, transports us to the south of Spain, where Gus and Monica's well-heeled expatriate life is derailed when Gus suffers a stroke, forcing their adult children to come running. So begins a great unravelling in which it transpires that Gus and Monica have been genteelly miserable for years, separated from their family and increasingly estranged from each other. It is all very restrained and very English. 'I think it's a national characteristic to be reticent and in many ways I'm rather admiring of it, but not if it obscures the realities,'she says. One of those realities is that 400,000 British people moved to Spain during the heyday of the EU, drawn by the lifestyle and the low land prices. Trollope's characters are not those who clustered around the 'Costa del Crime'ù, but a rarefied breed who opted for integration into local life, albeit as landowners. 'You could have acres and acres of land if you were inclined to have horses,'she says, disarmingly. Does she see Mum & Dad as a Brexit novel? 'I think one of the daughter-in-laws mentions Brexit at one point,'she says, tentatively. 'But I've just read Jonathan Coe's Middle England and, although it was of course extremely good, I think it had a very male perspective.'This parry is classic Trollope - so politely framed that one hardly notices how acerbic it is. The male perspective, it seems, is about structuring stories around the big picture. She admits she is 'more a social than a political writer'ù, adding: 'What I'm trying to do in all these novels is mirror a contemporary preoccupation. I'm not providing any solutions. I'm simply saying: 'òCan we please get the conversation going?''You don't turn to a Trollope novel for literary style or cultural nuance. But more than once during Mum & Dad I felt myself welling up: as a stepdaughter, sister and mother, juggling a career with a long-term relationship, I am undeniably part of the vast sisterhood that unites her readers and her characters. She recognises our foibles and gives us agency, but doesn't patronise us by guaranteeing a happy ending or, as she puts it, 'tying it all up in a bow'ù. The conversation points in Mum & Dad range from parental incapacity and stagnant marriages to sibling jostling and self-harm among adolescent girls. Although the relationship between grandparents and grandchildren is pivotal, the starting point was the in-betweeners. 'I wanted to write a novel about the sandwich generation: parents falling to pieces at one end of your life and children being quite demanding at the other. You, the woman, are probably working full-time, but society, which is really very old-fashioned, still expects women to do all the caring.'Like Monica, Trollope is part of a generation of women who were expected to follow their husbands around. However, she kicked over the traces, divorcing the father of her two daughters when the children were still young and supporting them before her first novels were published in her late 30s. Her second marriage added two stepsons to her family, but also ended in divorce. Tall and elegant in a herringbone jacket and shiny black knee boots, she looks like a cross between the headteacher of a private girls' school and the principal boy in the school pantomime. But appearances are deceptive, she warns. She may sound posh, but 'we had a rather frugal, austere and threadbare middle-class existence and I was actually a grammar school girl, so there's really nothing to be deduced from my accent.'Her story is awash with the strange cross-currents of an upper-middle-class childhood in the mid-20th century. Born in 1943 in her grandfather's Gloucestershire rectory, the oldest of three children, she didn't meet her father until he returned from military service in India when she was three. He went on to run a small building society, commuting to the City of London from Surrey. While she and her sister were state-educated, their brother was sent to private school (the trauma of boarding school lurks in the background of Mum & Dad - an unspoken injury, repeating itself through generations of families). Much has been made of her distant relationship through her father's side to the novelist Anthony Trollope, but less familiar is the colourful story of her maternal family, who lived in a house with five bathrooms in Glasgow and once had to escape the ministrations of a murderous housemaid who tried to poison them with arsenic. This privileged lifestyle was recounted by her mother, Rosemary, in columns for the Glasgow Herald newspaper; in a neat piece of reverse nepotism, they were engineered by Joanna and later collected into a book. Unable to cope with the more mundane duties of motherhood, the 'grandly chaotic'Rosemary, an artist, would set up her easel in her children's playpen to paint in peace while her toddlers roamed the house freely. The effects of distracted mothering are a theme of Mum & Dad. Neither Monica nor Katie is a very good parenting role model (Monica abandons her children to boarding school, while Katie is too busy managing her law career to notice her daughter's distress until it has become pathological). How did it work out for Trollope's children? 'You'd have to ask them,'she says. 'But it was always a question of working at the kitchen table in rented cottages after they'd gone to sleep.'Discouraged at school from aspiring to university, she won a scholarship to read English at Oxford, where a careers officer solemnly informed her and her best friend: 'The world, of course, is your oyster, girls: you can teach, you can nurse or you can sit the civil service exam.'Trollope says: 'I remember going out from this interview and standing rather gloomily by our bicycles, and Jill looking at me and saying: 'òD'you know, I think we're going to have to get married.''Instead, she briefly worked at the Foreign Office, before marrying a banker, David Potter, at the age of 22 and retraining as a teacher. She began her first (unpublished) novel while pregnant with the first of her two daughters, honing her skills for years while holding down a range of teaching jobs and at one point running a children's clothing business as well. In 1980, she won the Romantic Novelists' Association's novel of the year award for her second novel, Parson Harding's Daughter, an 18th-century yarn about a 'proud, plain and poor'young woman whose pursuit of a husband carries her from Dorset to Kolkata. Since rebranded under her pseudonym Caroline Harvey, along with her other early historical works, it continues to win fans as a 'feminist tale set in a time before feminism'ù, as one convert described it on a reader website. Although she abandoned historical romances in the mid-80s, she returned to them twice under her nom de plume, funding a law conversion course for one of her daughters through a publishing contract with Marks & Spencer ('They were very bad at it and marketed the books down among the lavatory rolls,'she says). She turned to contemporary fiction on the advice of her second husband, the TV dramatist Ian Curteis, who persuaded her that it was no longer an honour to be thought of as the new Georgette Heyer. He was proved right in 1991, when her fourth novel since the change pushed Jeffrey Archer off the top of the bestseller charts. The Rector's Wife went on to become the first of her novels to be adapted for TV, in a classy Channel 4 miniseries starring Lindsay Duncan and Ronald Pickup. Although her sales no longer rise to such dizzy heights, they chug along nicely. Writing at a rate of one novel every two years, she has sold more than a million books in the past decade. An Unsuitable Match has shifted 84,000 copies to date, narrowly missing a place among the top 100 paperback bestsellers of 2018. Between Joanna Trollope and Caroline Harvey, she has written more than 30 novels. But with popular success came a particular sort of literary scorn that is reserved for writers of middle-brow women's fiction. The term 'Aga saga'was invented by a (male) critic in 1992 to describe novels that, like hers, were largely set among middle-class families from small country towns (she has pointed out that Agas feature in only two of her novels). Does she think she has suffered from the label? 'Yes,'she says. 'Being categorised in this very narrow way has meant that it has been easy to dismiss the novels. And that is terribly patronising to the readership.'It is a contempt that male genre writers don't suffer, she says, pointing to the recent vogue among the literati for Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels. 'It's the reverse of intellectual snobbery, isn't it? A kind of snobbery of its own.'It surprises her, 'because the novels seem to me improbable: the situation, the narrative, the man himself. But then I'm just not very good at anything that is fantastical. I can't read science fiction. I can't read fantasy. I can't even read Harry Potter very well, because of the magic.'What matters, she says, is that people believe in her characters and find them useful. 'For all that somebody gets dumped every nanosecond in the world, you don't want to be lumped in with everybody else - you want it to be expressed as poignantly and vividly as you feel it yourself,'she says. 'A cliche is only a cliche if it's happening in someone else's life.'This brings her to her impatience with those who dismiss novels as frivolous entertainment. 'Men of my generation say to me: 'òOf course, my wife might read everything you've ever written, but I only read nonfiction.' But if you wanted to know what the retreat from Moscow really felt like, you wouldn't read a history of the Napoleonic wars - you'd read War and Peace.'Fiction, she suggests, 'can be a physical confessional: when you're within the covers of a book, you can admit to all kinds of things that you can't otherwise. It's also where you learn about the rest of human life and where you get your most profound experience of life - except from actually living it.'Trollope lives in a house in central London, 'which I occupy with no trouble at all on my own'ù, writing in longhand at an old director's desk. Already an OBE, she was made a CBE in the Queen's birthday honours last year for services to literature. She supports a raft of causes that reflect hard times in her own life: Meningitis Now, in thanks for the narrow escape of one of her daughters at the age of seven; Alzheimer's research, in honour of her father, who had the disease for 15 years; and various cancer charities, in memory of Jill, her university friend with the bicycle, 'who died far too young'ù. Her record as the chronicler of a world where problems are seldom simple raises her above any number of sneering reviews. 'I suppose I'm a feminist of the old school,'she says, in that she believes in women's right to equality, but thinks the pendulum has swung too far. 'There are some women who want to change the world and there are some who want to stay at home and make jam with a three-year-old. They should all be allowed to do all of those things without being judged. When will we stop judging each other?'After all, she concludes briskly, 'it's that Virginia Woolf thing: 'òLet us not take it for granted that life exists more fully in what is commonly thought big than in what is commonly thought small.' There's something very salutary about just cleaning the bathroom, because, when you can't control huge emotional upsets in politics or in your life, you can at least polish the taps.'Mum & Dad is published by Pan Macmillan on 5 March.

EU warns UK to tone down political rhetoric as trade talks start,-0.125,Negative,"The EU is urging Britain to drop the 'political rhetoric'around Brexit as historic talks on the future trading relationship open in Brussels. As an army of 100 officials led by Britain's chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, descend on the Belgian capital on Monday, senior EU diplomats are warning that if the political temperature continues to rise over Brexit in the UK it will risk smothering talks. They are concerned about the political relationship between the UK and the EU, characterised by furious language including warnings that each side will 'rip'each other apart, and the second relationship - that among officials tasked with examining the deeper, drier technical complexities of disentangling and reimaging 47 years of joint laws and regulations. As soon as the debate around Brexit moves to the 'tunnel'of technical detail and away from the politics, the quicker a space can be opened up for a deal, say sources. They warn the agreement will affect people and business across 28 countries and it behoves both sides to get away from politics and do a good deal for both sides. The deadline to reach a deal is the end of the year, with key elements including fishing rights, due to be resolved by 1 July, leaving just three months for the opposing sides to resolve headline differences for a 'stocktake'in mid-June. Detailed negotiations on potential tariffs are impossible in this timeframe. That means the only way to get a deal is to have close alignment on regulations on both sides, said a source. They said the most contentious issues will not be tariffs, quotas and market access but 'governance and dispute resolution'ù, given that the UK has comprehensively rejected any role for the European institutions or the European court of justice. Among the issues slated as easier to resolve are transport, chemical waste and Horizon Europe, the science research programme. The EU is said to have abandoned any hope of 'dynamic alignment'whereby the UK would agree to abide closely to EU regulations as they evolved in coming years. That is now considered a dead topic, following the publication of the UK's trading mandate last week. Fisheries, so emblematic on the British side of the leave vote, is expected to be one of the trickiest issues politically with Denmark, France, Spain, the Netherlands and Ireland insisting on continued access to British waters. The two sides have already clashed over the issue but EU sources say they don't need a full agreement by July, merely an outline of a deal which will give a 'hint'to the fishing communities that their 2020 fishing rights are secure. The areas to be discussed on Tuesday and Wednesday are: trade in goods; trade in services; transport energy and civil nuclear co-operation; fisheries; a level playing field for open and fair competition; law enforcement and judicial co-operation; participation in union programmes; mobility and social security; cooperation in programmes such as Horizon Europe; and governance and dispute resolution. According to the agenda, published by the EU, the talks will start with a meeting of lead negotiators on Monday, moving to an opening plenary session at 4.30pm. The group is so large that from Tuesday negotiators will be moved from the Berlaymont headquarters of the European commission to a conference centre. The talks will be split into 11 groups covering everything from trade and nuclear energy to fisheries and state aid. This week's talks will be the first of 10 rounds that will take place every three weeks, alternating between Brussels and London. ",0.25,Positive
"UK races to find extra 50,000 staff for post-Brexit paperwork",-0.375,Negative,"A race to hire 50,000 people in the next six months to process Brexit paperwork is under way after the government confirmed they would be needed for border operations. But experts have warned it will be a challenge to train enough people in time to be competent in the complexity of customs declarations and the second layer of red tape involving entry and exit declaration forms that are mandatory for trading with the EU. The Road Haulage Association has warned that the number of declaration forms for tariffs alone will rocket from the current 50m a year to 200-250m a year. In addition, the exit and entry forms introduced after the 9/11 terror attack in New York to ensure safety on ferries and planes will involve another 100-125m forms being processed every year. Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who is responsible for readying the country for full Brexit at the end of the year, confirmed in parliament on Thursday afternoon that the RHA estimated 50,000 new recruits would be needed in the next six months. Rod McKenzie, the managing director of policy and public affairs at the RHA, said: 'We have been told by a large freight company expert in the field that they get a productivity of around 4,000 clearances a year per staff member (that is about 20 clearances a day). That makes sense given the complexity of many transactions. Worth noting, that is with skilled, trained, experienced labour. 'So if we are dealing with 200m extra declarations, at a productivity rate of 4,000 per year that equals 50,000 staff needed on day one, and probably more.' Gove has access to about £7.5m to fund new HRMC customs agents but may seek funds from the wider Border Delivery Group cross-department initiative to prepare for 1 January 2021. Neighbouring countries including France, the Netherlands and Ireland launched customs officials recruitment drives last year, with six-month training schedules considered a minimum. Agents in Dover who deal with lorries coming in from the Ukraine, Turkey and other non-EU countries have warned that the skills base around customs disappeared with the creation of the single market in 1991, with just a handful of customs agents now operating in offices in Dover. The emergence of the human resource needed puts into perspective the scale of the task - the number of staff needed dwarfs the 12,000 people estimated to work in the fishing industry, a sector emblematic of Brexit. Government sources have said the new recruits would largely be 'intermediaries'ù, agents who help businesses process their export and import paperwork with HMRC. The tax authorities will also recruit government agents to process the paperwork and guard against tariff evasion on borders. The Freight Transport Association and the RHA have been pressing the government for the past three years to wake up to the realities of a hard Brexit. The FTA said Thursday's publication of the government's negotiating goals gave some 'hope'in that it provided confirmation that the government was not pursuing frictionless trade. However, it called for 'more ambition'to help road, aviation and rail transport prepare to minimise the disruption from 1 January. 'Over recent months, the FTA has repeatedly requested the UK government prioritise the needs of logistics in its negotiations around the future trading relationship with the EU or risk a devastating effect on the UK's highly interconnected supply chain. The business organisation has also warned of knock-on effects on UK plc's future productivity, and on the economy as a whole but these concerns seem to have been overlooked,'it said in a statement.

UK Google users could lose EU GDPR data protections,-0.625,Negative,"Google is to move the data and user accounts of its British users from the EU to the US, placing them outside the strong privacy protections offered by European regulators. The shift, prompted by Britain's exit from the EU, will leave the sensitive personal information of tens of millions not covered by Europe's world-leading General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and therefore with less protection and within easier reach of British law enforcement. Google intends to require its British users to acknowledge new terms of service including the new jurisdiction, according to people familiar with the plans. 'Nothing about our services or our approach to privacy will change, including how we collect or process data, and how we respond to law enforcement demands for users' information,'Google said in a statement. 'The protections of the UK GDPR will still apply to these users.'Ireland, where Google and other US tech companies have their European headquarters, is staying in the EU, which has one of the world's most aggressive data protection rules, the GDPR. It is understood that Google decided to move its British users out of Irish jurisdiction because it is unclear whether Britain will follow GDPR or adopt other rules that could affect the handling of user data. If British Google users have their data kept in Ireland, it would be more difficult for British authorities to recover it in criminal investigations. The recent Cloud Act in the US, however, is expected to make it easier for British authorities to obtain data from US companies. Britain and the US are also on track to negotiate a broader trade agreement. Beyond that, the US has among the weakest privacy protections of any major economy, with no broad law despite years of advocacy by consumer protection groups. Google has amassed one of the largest stores of information about people and uses the data to tailor services and sell advertising. Google could also have had British accounts answer to a British subsidiary, but has opted not to do so. Lea Kissner, Google's former lead for global privacy technology, said she would have been surprised if the company had kept British accounts controlled in an EU country with the UK no longer a member. 'There's a bunch of noise about the UK government possibly trading away enough data protection to lose adequacy under GDPR, at which point having them in Google Ireland's scope sounds super-messy,'Kissner said. 'Never discount the desire of tech companies not be caught in between two different governments.'Jim Killock, the executive director of the digital rights organisation Open Rights Group, said: 'Moving people's personal information to the USA makes it easier for mass surveillance programmes to access it. There is nearly no privacy protection for non-US citizens. 'Google's decision should worry everyone who thinks tech companies are too powerful and know too much about us. The UK must commit to European data protection standards or we are likely to see our rights being swiftly undermined by 'òanything goes' US privacy practices.' The UK's exit from the EU and its data protection regulations are likely to make the data-sharing agreements that cover transfer of user information from one part of a global business to another, or to other businesses, extremely complicated. If the UK decides not to adopt rules that form equivalent data protections to that granted by GDPR, then extensive data-sharing agreements may be necessary. In coming months, other tech companies will have to make similar choices to Google. Facebook, which has a similar setup to Google, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Ursula von der Leyen mocks Boris Johnson's stance on EU trade deal,-0.125,Negative,"Ursula von der Leyen has mocked Boris Johnson's claims to be willing to accept an Australian-style trade deal with the EU by reminding MEPs that no such agreement exists. In a speech to the EU's parliament in Strasbourg, the president of the European commission repeatedly named the prime minister as she picked out the contradictions in his approach to the post-Brexit arrangements. Von der Leyen noted that the 'Canada-style deal'referred to by Johnson as his primary goal in the coming negotiations contained tariffs and quota limits on some goods crossing the Atlantic. Both sides have said they want to avoid such costs and barriers to trade. Von der Leyen also pointed out that there were also stringent level playing field conditions to ensure high standards in that deal. 'And, honestly, I was a little bit surprised to hear the prime minister of the United Kingdom speak about the Australian model,'Von der Leyen said in response to Johnson's recent claim to be willing to replicate such a trade 'deal'if other arrangements proved unachievable. 'Australia without any doubt is a strong and a like-minded partner,'Von der Leyen told MEPs. 'But the European Union does not have a trade agreement with Australia. We are currently trading on WTO terms. And if this is the British choice, well, we are fine with that without any question. But, in fact, we just are in the moment where we are agreeing with Australia that we must end this situation and we work on a trade deal with them.''Of course the United Kingdom can decide to settle for less but I personally believe we should be way more ambitious,'Von der Leyen said. Negotiations between the UK and the EU on the future relationship are due to begin in the first week of March, when Brussels has finalised its opening position. The UK left the EU on 31 January and will withdraw from the bloc's single market and customs union at the end of this year at which point the newly negotiated arrangements will come into force.  A 'political declaration'agreed between two sides last year lays out the basis for the negotiation and includes a commitment to maintaining high standards in key areas of the economy to ensure that neither side is undercutting the other. Johnson has recently said, however, that there was no reason for the UK to align with EU state aid, environmental and social standards as part of any trade deal. Von der Leyen expressed some bemusement at the prime minister's approach, as she quoted Johnson's claim in a recent speech in Greenwich that the UK would be a 'global champion of free trade'ù. 'Frankly this is music to our ears,'she said. The former German defence minister insisted, however, that the free trade agreements the EU had with Canada and Japan were 'not just increasing our bilateral exchanges of goods services, people and ideas'ù. 'They also raise standards on a broad range of issues from labour rights to environmental and this is what makes us proud of them,'she said. 'When we agreed the political declaration with the United Kingdom we 'òambitioned' a zero-tariffs and zero-quota trade relations for all goods. Something we have never ever before offered to anybody else '¶ But of course this will require corresponding guarantees on fair competition and protection of social, environmental and consumer standards.'Von der Leyen said it was 'not the time'to lower standards or be 'lukewarm'on the climate crisis. She said there needed to be formal agreement between the two sides to 'trigger an upward dynamic of protection that would benefit both the United Kingdom and the European Union'ù. ",0.625,Positive
Boris Johnson's hard line on trade could sink the UK's fishing fleet,-0.75,Negative,"Brexiteers and big fishing interests say that Britain 'betrayed'its fishing fleets when we joined the EEC in 1973. For the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, for instance, Brexit offers a 'sea of opportunity'for struggling coastal communities. The first claim is largely a myth. The second is an exaggeration and, for a thriving section of Britain's fishing industry, a lie. If Boris Johnson pursues his hard line in trade talks with the EU27, he will betray many industries, from car-making to pharmaceuticals to farming. He will also betray - and genuinely betray this time - a large part of the British fishing fleet. Much of UK fishing - broadly the small-scale, ecologically sound part - is dependent on frictionless, overnight trade in fish, especially live shellfish and crustaceans, with the EU. About two-thirds of the shellfish, lobsters, crabs and langoustines caught by British fishers are sold to the continent. That trade only exists because of the paper-free EU single market. It is the larger-scale, rich, noisy part of British fishing that drives the strident demands for a much bigger share of catches in UK waters. In their opening salvoes in the post-Brexit trade negotiations, the British government and the EU27 have drawn competing lines in the sea. Johnson says Britain will 'take back control'of fishing in its 'exclusive economic zone'of up to 200 miles from the end of this year. He is prepared to talk about access for EU boats but insists quotas must be 'first and foremost'for Britain. The EU says that unless agreement is reached on continued widespread access by the end of July, there will be no favourable trade deal for Britain - not on fish and not on anything else. In the annexe to its negotiating guidelines, Brussels said that a UK-EU deal must 'build on'the existing deal which gives EU boats 60% by weight of landings from British waters. The EU wants a permanent deal; Britain wants annual negotiations. These are the opening positions. Common sense, economic self-interest and international law may eventually enforce compromise on both sides. That could be awkward for the government, given how absurdly overblown Brexiteers' expectations have become. Last month Peter Aldous, the Tory MP for Waveney in Suffolk, told BBC Radio 4 that Brexit would bring a 'sevenfold growth of our quota stocks in the southern North Sea'ù. Talk of the 'southern North Sea'is misleading: it is not an especially rich or important fishing area. Taking all 'British'waters within the 200 mile limit, we now catch 40% of the fish by weight (60% by value). A sevenfold increase would mean taking 280% of the sustainable catch. To reach the 'Aldous quota'our boats would have to throw the fish back and catch them again - twice. Here are some more reliable fishing facts. Under international law, Britain became an independent coastal state in 'control'of its waters up to 200 miles last Friday. But that control is not absolute. Under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the UK is legally obliged to manage shared North Sea and Atlantic stocks with Norway - and the EU. The convention also requires - but does not oblige - Britain to consider the historical fishing rights of its neighbours. Despite the Brexit lie that European boats were 'given'access to British waters when we joined the EEC in 1973, they have actually fished 'our'waters for centuries - just as our trawlers fished off Iceland and Norway. EU boats were allocated quotas in UK waters broadly in line with their historical catches. While it's true that these were high in tonnage terms, the catching rights include large quantities of fish for which there is little demand in the UK, such as horse mackerel and saithe. When Britain and the EU do sit down to talk about the political price of fish, an equable deal on access and quotas is possible. Brexit or not, there is a strong case to reboot the catch shares first set in 1983. As a result of the climate crisis and other factors, fish no longer swim in the same places they did 37 years ago. Cod and hake have migrated farther north in the North Sea and Atlantic; tuna and anchovies are found in numbers off Cornwall. Some increase in British quotas for mackerel, herring, cod and hake is justified. Removing overnight the livelihoods of hundreds of French, Irish, Dutch and Danish fishermen is not. Such a deal would fall short of the strident demands for a post-Brexit 'bonanza'ù, which is driven mostly by a few, often foreign-owned, fishing companies in England and a dozen or so wealthy families that control fishing in Scotland. Too bad. If this government is genuinely concerned about 'left behind coastal communities'ù, it should give priority to increasing the tiny quotas for the thousands of British inshore vessels under 10 metres long. All of this is possible, but it would require a long, sensible, technical negotiation that sets clear and achievable aims. Nothing in the government's recent, vacuous fisheries bill suggests that such questions have even been considered. In any case, quotas are something of a red herring. The real threat to the survival of a large, thriving, ecologically responsible swathe of the British fishing industry comes from Johnson himself. The kind of minimal trade deal envisaged by the government will cripple not only British farmers and factories, but sink a large part of Britain's fishing fleet. No 'sea of opportunity'for them.

The Guardian view on Scottish politics: tough new tests all round,-0.25,Negative,"In UK terms, Derek Mackay is not a high-profile politician. But he has been a very important one in Scotland in the last decade, and a star within the governing SNP. His resignation as Scottish finance secretary and his suspension from the party after sending hundreds of texts to a 16-year-old male is thus a major personal and political event. It comes at what was already a significant time for Nicola Sturgeon's government, with renewed support for independence in the face of Boris Johnson's refusal to sanction a second referendum, and amid mounting domestic criticism of the SNP's record. With the former leader Alex Salmond soon to face trial for alleged sexual offences, the Mackay scandal was the last thing that Ms Sturgeon wanted. Now it is suddenly a key part of a major set of tests for the first minister, her judgment, her party and her government. The pivotal question is whether and how far these other issues disrupt or override the anger of Scottish voters that EU withdrawal is being imposed by a Conservative party whose governing majority is drawn from elsewhere. The first minister sees this as an injustice for which the best remedy is independence - but she sees that as the remedy to everything, which diminishes the potency of the argument. Brexit gives nationalists a resonant new grievance. It does not improve the economic case for independence or make it easier to achieve. But the pro-independence side's defeat in the 2014 referendum is a bigger problem for Ms Sturgeon. Mr Johnson never tires of pointing out that the SNP recognised the once-per-generation status of that ballot. Mr Johnson is a terrible messenger for unionism - a caricature of English Tory arrogance - but he is not wrong to remind nationalists that Scotland recently chose to stay in the UK. Many Scottish voters think a first minister's energies might more usefully be spent governing than demanding a referendum rematch. Ms Sturgeon's riposte is that Brexit has changed facts and minds, so the rematch is democratically imperative. Some opinion polls indicate a slender pro-independence majority, with a pivotal shift in that direction caused by a migration of EU remainers who voted no in 2014. Ms Sturgeon wants to ride that mood to victory in next year's Scottish parliament elections. Such a result would, she believes, signal enough backing for a second referendum that Mr Johnson would be obliged to grant one. More radical nationalists believe Westminster's permission is not required, but legally it is. The first minister is wise to stick to the letter of the law. An aggressive snatch for independence would suffocate Scotland's prospects of one day rejoining the EU.  The long game has mostly suited the SNP, but it has limits. When the Holyrood poll comes around, the party will have been governing for 14 years and gaps in its record cannot be ignored. Scottish schoolchildren underperform in literacy and numeracy tests relative to their English peers. Scottish policing is bogged down in a crisis so acute that the chair of the watchdog authority washed her hands of it in December. Tory austerity is the SNP's default excuse for poor services but public spending is around 20% higher per capita than in England. Ms Sturgeon cannot shrug off the weight of incumbency indefinitely. The Mackay scandal makes that attempt much more difficult than it was already. Whatever difficulties the SNP faces, it is blessed with weak and incompetent enemies. Under Jeremy Corbyn, Labour blurred its position on a second referendum and has yet to regain focus. Mr Johnson's lines are crisp, but his crass manner boosts the separatist cause. If the case for preserving a United Kingdom is monopolised by a Tory party pumped up on Brexit, the argument will fall flat. That case should stand above party loyalties. It should escape the arena of competing nationalisms - English and Scottish - and appeal to a wider sense of shared history and collective endeavour. Sadly, leaders who are gifted at expressing that vision are in short supply. The arguments are not well rehearsed. Supporters of the EU discovered the equivalent weakness of their position too late. Believers in a United Kingdom must not make the same mistake. ",0.625,Positive
"Brexit and the first of many tests for our parliamentary system
",0.125,Positive,"David Runciman is wrong about the inevitability of Brexit (It was all a dream, Journal, 1 February) but highlights important lessons about skill and systems in politics. Leavers won because they had the skills, strategies and, above all, language that spoke to voters' concerns about identity, immigration, the NHS and lack of control. They knew a referendum was necessary to leave the EU and a parliamentary majority was needed to make it happen, which brings me to political systems. The UK's parliamentary system was severely tested, and will be tested again by the government's ability to satisfy voters, negotiate trade deals and respond to demands for Scottish independence. City mayors and citizens' assemblies also give politics new possibilities. Nothing is inevitable, so long as citizens have agency, skill and persistence to pursue a cause effectively. What we need from the Guardian is information and analysis to really understand what our fellow citizens are feeling (as John Harris and Gary Younge have provided) and how power works, in the City, government and globally, to learn how to create a just and sustainable world.Titus AlexanderAuthor of Practical Politics: Lessons in Power and Democracy '¢ David Runciman reminds us that 'An elected government, enacting its will through parliament, made the referendum happen.'He doesn't mention that in debating the referendum bill in parliament, a suggested amendment was said to 'make no sense'because the referendum was 'merely advisory'- as of course it legally was, and as of course it was known to be by the then minister for Europe who said this. Runciman also reminds us that 'Both main parties went into that election promising to respect the result of the referendum.'He doesn't mention that respecting the referendum meant very different things for the different parties, as their manifestos made plain. In the event, only a very hard Brexit could eventually win in parliament. This was owed to the fact that the advocates of a very hard Brexit (members of the ERG and long-term Eurosceptics) all belonged to the party that managed, by a whisker and then by a landslide, to stay in government. I'd blame our exit from the EU on two things combined: 1) No thought has ever been given to what the terms should be of a referendum on a question which might lead to massive constitutional change in a country composed of four sub-nations; 2) Our first-past-the-post system for electing representatives. Our system served remainers ill. Despite this, I don't think that one has to be under any illusions in order to think that it was worth a fight. Only in retrospect could the events of 31 January strike one as inevitable. YouGov polling now shows, as it has for a while, that 7% more people think that the decision to leave the EU was wrong than think it was right (with around 10% 'don't knows'admittedly). For some this will suggest that a different electoral system would serve the nation better. But you'll probably only resonate to the suggestion if, like me, you're fearful for the UK's future and you find it deeply regrettable that we've come to be ruled by populists.Jennifer HornsbyLondon '¢ Join the debate - email guardian.letters@theguardian.com '¢ Read more Guardian letters - click here to visit gu.com/letters '¢ Do you have a photo you'd like to share with Guardian readers?

EU states look in poor health to withstand a global crisis,-0.125,Negative,"The focus was inevitably on Britain as the clock ticked down on Friday night towards the moment of departure from the European Union. How would the economy fare on the outside of the world's biggest market in the years to come? What sort of trade deal with the EU would be cooked up in the scant time available for negotiations? How easy would it be to do a deal with the arch-protectionist Donald Trump? Those are all perfectly reasonable questions. But they are based on an assumption: that Britain is weak and doing badly, and the remaining 27 members of the EU are strong and doing well. That, most definitely, is not the case. Official figures showed that growth in the eurozone eased back from 0.3% to 0.1% in the final three months of 2019. France and Italy - the second- and third-biggest monetary-union countries - both recorded falls in output. Data for Germany, Europe's powerhouse economy, has yet to be released, but the signs are that it grew by as little as 0.1%. Strikes in France were partly responsible for the 0.1% drop in French GDP but industrial unrest was not to blame for the 0.3% contraction in Italy, a country where output has yet to regain pre-financial crisis levels. Germany, meanwhile, has been struggling because its economy depends on the export of manufacturing goods. These have been adversely affected by a slowdown in global demand exacerbated by President Trump's aggressive approach to trade. At the start of the year there was some hope that the global economy had bottomed out. Central banks had provided a fresh dose of monetary stimulus, and demand seemed to be picking up. Washington and Beijing called a truce in their trade war. The International Monetary Fund was starting to sound a bit more optimistic about the state of the global economy. Then the coronavirus struck. It is too early to say whether the deaths in China represent a Black Swan event - something that comes as a shock and has a major impact - but the crisis certainly has the potential to be one. Already there have been indications of slower growth in China, curbs on air travel, and fears that global supply chains could be severed. None of which is good for Germany or the wider European economy. If, as most economists expect, the Chinese government quickly gets to grips with the coronavirus, the hit to the global economy will be brief and modest. If it doesn't, the EU is in serious trouble. Why? First there is not a great deal of scope to loosen policy, at least in the conventional sense. The European Central Bank is operating with negative interest rates and has restarted its quantitative easing - or money creation - programme. There is not a lot more the ECB can do. Second, Europe has never really recovered from the last crisis. The ECB was slower than the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, slower to experiment with quantitative easing, and lacked the wherewithal to sort out the bad-debt problems of Europe's banks. So while the credit channels in the US are again functioning, in the eurozone they are still blocked, making monetary policy less effective than it would otherwise be. There is one final problem: monetary union will remain half-baked without a banking union and a unified eurozone budget. Neither - largely due to German opposition - is remotely in prospect. The year ahead is going to be tough - just as tough, if not tougher, than it will be for the UK. Aston Martin's much-hyped stock market float has ended with a humiliating bailout by a billionaire not even 18 months later. The luxury carmaker's executives, international shareholders and bankers made fortunes from the initial public offering in late 2018. Aston Martin was 'worth'£4.3bn at the time, a valuation that was rapidly revealed to be fanciful. A plan that relied on a new factory doubling total production meant that the company's chief executive, Andy Palmer, was always walking a tightrope. When sales dropped and costs kept rising, Aston Martin was left horribly exposed. The serial fashion investor Lawrence Stroll, who led the rescue consortium and will now become executive chairman, at least appears to have his heart in it, with a pledge to use the Aston Martin brand on his Formula One racing team for the next decade.  Investors have welcomed Stroll. Following a cash injection to stave off bankruptcy, the shares rose 24% on Friday (though they are still just a quarter of their £19 float price). With the prospect of a James Bond marketing blitz around the latest film in April - just as Aston Martin starts production of its new DBX SUV - and the stardust of Formula One, there might finally be a few reasons for cautious optimism at the company's HQ in Warwickshire. Still, there are bumps ahead. The bet on an untested SUV is not a surefire winner. Nor are luxury products aimed at the rich immune from shocks. China is key for the SUV, so the coronavirus could not have come at a worse time. Slashing investment in zero-emissions electric battery technology will surely store up problems for the future for shareholders (not to mention the planet). Palmer needs the DBX launch to go to plan if the bailout is not to become his swan song. No one familiar with 'secondary'ticketing will have been surprised to see the ticket resale site StubHub criticised by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for allegedly misleading consumers and potentially breaking consumer law. After all, we've been here before. The CMA has fought a long-running battle with StubHub's chief rival, Viagogo, which refused to change its ways until the CMA resorted to legal action. StubHub styles itself as the more acceptable face of ticketing. Now it has been accused by the regulator of Viagogo-style transgressions, such as selling tickets without warning buyers that they might be refused entry to events when artists have imposed prohibitions on resale. The company also allegedly misleads consumers about the scarcity of available tickets - a pressure-selling tactic. If both major resale sites behave like this, what hope is there of any improvement if Viagogo's proposed £3.1bn takeover of StubHub goes ahead, creating an unrivalled industry powerhouse? The CMA is currently weighing up whether to intervene in the British part of this tie-up on monopoly grounds. It is hard to imagine why it would allow the two major players in the UK's ticket resale market to get together, even if they had spotless records. While the watchdog has the power to intervene in the merger, its teeth are less sharp when it comes to consumer law. The CMA can go to court but it's a lengthy and costly process that requires a judge to make a ruling. That's why the CMA's chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, used the StubHub announcement to call for the regulator to be given greater powers to determine when consumer law has been broken and to issue fines. Given the difficulty it has had in bringing StubHub and Viagogo to heel, it is hard to argue that the CMA should be denied more effective ways of exercising its authority. ",0.5,Positive
Boris Johnson is still triumphant. Huawei shows that won't last,-0.125,Negative,"A big election victory never looks more impregnable than on the morning after. The Conservative triumph on 12 December was no exception: the verdict seemed absolute. Boris Johnson hymned the dawn of a glorious new era. Labour took refuge in the infantile disorder of imagining itself the heroic 'resistance'to an all-powerful ruler. The headlines promised that a Commons majority of 80 would mean 'Johnson unleashed'with a mandate 'to govern as he likes'ù. Two months on these can be seen as silly overstatements. The whirligig of time is already threatening revenges on the Johnson government. The most important example of this is its confusion over the role of Huawei in building the UK's 5G phone networks. But Huawei is one dilemma among many. It is also an example of a larger truth. Just as all political careers are said to end in failure, so do all governments. For governments, the morning after the election is as good as it gets. From that day on, things get tougher. The arrow of time tends to fly from order towards disorder. A form of political entropy sets in, almost as remorselessly in government as in the laws of physics. To govern on day 100 or day 1,000 as you govern on day one is folly. Goethe knew what he was doing when he made Mephistopheles tell Faust that he would lose his freedom as soon as he asked for the perfect moment to last for ever. It seemed like a great deal, but it was the opposite. This worm in the bud exists for Johnson too, even this week. Britain's exit from the European Union is unquestionably Johnson's victory. It will be his principal claim on history. But then what? Once the departure is done, it is done. Johnson will try to trade on it for years to come, and he may do so quite successfully. But he now owns Brexit outright: he will own its failures, delays and compromises as well as any successes. Whatever happens in the coming stages of the Brexit process, things will get more, not less, tricky. Johnson still possesses enviable political capital. But he has had to spend a fair amount of it over Huawei. Many of his MPs, and some of his cabinet, think the decision to let Huawei build parts of the 5G network is seriously wrong. Some of them will go on saying so, mainly in private, but some - especially some who have given up hope of ministerial office - will so do in public. An impressive list of big Tory names attacked the Huawei decision in the Commons on Tuesday: Liam Fox, Julian Lewis, David Davis, Iain Duncan Smith, Penny Mordaunt, Bernard Jenkin, Damian Collins. A majority of 80 gives Johnson a big cushion, but he should not be complacent. National security is an issue on which many Tories, especially those with an Atlanticist or military background, have gut instincts that will not change. Some, even now, are already on manoeuvres for the future. Others have been backbench rebels for so long that they can't kick the habit. But it will only take a monstrous cyber-hack or a piece of heavy-handed action by the Beijing government against Hong Kong, Taiwan or the Uighur Muslims for the whole Huawei issue to flare up again. Even at this early stage in the life of the new government, it's not just Huawei that presents dilemmas. At prime minister's questions on Wednesday, Johnson had to tiptoe around the issue of Donald Trump's Middle East plan. As with the issue of Iran in the wake of the Qassem Suleimani assassination, Johnson has a difficult balancing act to perform. He has to juggle the Trump connection with longer term issues about trade, security and alliances. He has to weigh the response in the Tory party, the country and the EU. And he has to make his response to each of these dilemmas fit somehow within the government's fatal conceit of post-Brexit Britain as a freebooting global power. Difficult though they are, not even Johnson thinks these international jugglings are as important as the ones he faces at home. Here the list is also very long and very live. The most immediate is HS2, on which a decision that will again divide the Tory party may come on Thursday. Rail privatisation, in the wake of Wednesday's renationalisation of Northern Rail, is not far behind as a difficult issue. Heathrow expansion looms. Meanwhile issues such as Northern Ireland, Scotland, immigration, fishing, the budget and the cabinet reshuffle will all have the power to knock the government off course too. This is not to pretend that Johnson remains anything except dominant in current politics. His authority remains largely untapped. Nor is he powerless to shape his own political destiny if things go awry. But it is to say that politics is quickly reconfiguring itself in a familiar way that is at odds with the simplistic assumptions of December. Modern British history contains many examples of governments that were brought low in spite of winning clear majorities in elections. Harold Wilson's 1966 government did not survive devaluation and the failure to reform the trade unions. Margaret Thatcher's victories in 1983 and 1987 were torpedoed by Westland (the Huawei of its day) and the poll tax respectively. John Major's win in 1992 was kneecapped by a run on the pound and by Europe. Tony Blair's 2001 landslide was wrecked by Iraq. David Cameron destroyed himself over Brexit. Some of these governments were strong enough to weather those challenges. Others were not. Johnson is lucky that so much depends on the credibility of the opposition. His government may prove to be one of the more resilient ones. But no perfect moment endures. Political danger never goes away entirely. Even in this week of his greatest triumph over Brexit, it is not true to say Johnson is unleashed. In fact the leash that restrains him is becoming increasingly obvious.

What having a heart attack taught me about Brexit,-0.125,Negative,"Something can be massive without being obvious, as I learned by having a heart attack. The symptoms should not have left doubt: sudden, severe chest pain; a burning lash down the left arm; air refusing to enter the lungs; a vibrating sense of ill-being, the world turning sour and dark. Still I hesitated before getting help. At some level I knew what was up, but really not wanting a heart attack seemed like a compelling reason why I wasn't having one. Forty-five seemed a bit premature for that sort of thing. Later, recovering in hospital, I was described as young with a frequency that would be flattering in other contexts. In hindsight, the symptoms had started a lot earlier. The feeling in my chest was an extreme variant of tightness I had felt before while running, and dismissed as unfitness. (Turns out: angina.) Such is the awesome power of denial, a psychological term cheapened by overuse. We are always describing others and even deprecating ourselves for being 'in denial'of the smallest things, which is itself a kind of denial. Admitting shortsightedness around minor flaws is a way to avoid admitting blindness to much worse. I was still hooked up to cardiac monitors and full of morphine, barely an hour after the insertion of two stents, when the metaphorical comparisons first presented themselves. The Labour party had ignored vital warning signs for years, failing to change course when avoidance of calamity was still available. So too had Britain's pro-European campaign. I won't stress the point too hard, being on doctor's orders to minimise stress of all kinds. The compulsion to turn even my own medical emergency into a political analogy flagged a lifestyle habit in need of healthy adaptation. A month of convalescence has taught me to care differently. Not less, but less angrily. It pushes the metaphor too far to say that Brexit broke my heart. I was culturally and emotionally attached to the European project and still believe UK involvement has improved this country. It will hurt on Friday night when EU membership ends, but not as much as it hurts when a blocked artery cuts off blood to the left ventricle. Having survived one of those experiences, I am palpably more relaxed facing the other one. It also helps to understand those hearts that will leap at 11pm on 31 January. That sensitivity does not include deference to asinine Tory MPs licking their lips and commemorative stamps with triumphant relish. One of their number, Mark Francois, says he will stay up all night to 'watch the sun rise on a free country'ù. Neither he nor any of his co-fetishists has satisfactorily explained what, in practice, they will be free to do on Saturday that is forbidden today. In truth, the measurable liberties available that dawn will be European ones, preserved thanks to a transition period that the all-nighter Brexit celebrants resent as deferral of a greater rupture. But there I have lapsed into another bad old habit. Remainers lost the argument with arch, eye-rolling negativity. In 2016 the pro-European case was made exclusively in terms of loss - forfeited growth, shrunken prestige, jettisoned jobs - while the leavers advertised gains. After the referendum, those Brexit promises were assailed by fact-checkers, myth-busters, expert debunkers, but what was the counter offer? What would leavers get in exchange for surrendering a prize for which they had voted, to which they were democratically entitled and which they had not yet received? On we went, rubbishing the idea that Brexit was a bounty of freedom, sovereignty and control, irritating more than we converted, until Boris Johnson came along to lift the siege. By December, the liberation he could realistically offer voters wasn't from Europe any more, it was from the argument encircling them. It was from us, the remainers. Johnson's winning formula was to downgrade the promise of Brexit from reward to relief, which was easier to deliver and still sounded marvellous. His opponents complain that the 'Boris'brand of optimism is fraudulent, but that doesn't matter when it is unrivalled in the market. Pro-Europeans got stuck in a quicksand of nostalgia, rosily tinting the epoch of unchallenged EU membership as a golden age of moderation. It was easy to see it that way as the Conservative party waged war on economics and geography, making dissidents of its sanest MPs. But the remainer lament often sounded like privilege drowning in self-pity, which isn't any more attractive in politics than in other walks of life. We had facts on our side, certain ours was the rational position. The failure to change minds just seemed to prove that rationality itself was in peril. Donald Trump marauding from the White House supported that hypothesis. But for all the solidity of our claims, the case we built from them was hypothetical. Brexit hadn't happened yet, so we couldn't convincingly call it a disaster. Nothing, it seemed, was really happening, despite the frenzy in Westminster. The whole of politics between the referendum and the 2019 election seems to have been conducted in zero gravity. Arguments that should have weight had none and any crazy notions, once hurled, could fly around with infinite momentum. Only in the unique conditions of space flight could a man built like Johnson cavort like a gymnast. The landing begins on Friday. The country will soon feel the friction of re-entry into a thicker political atmosphere. The prime minister is already feeling the pressure of earthly decisions: high-speed rail; Chinese involvement in 5G infrastructure; the divergent pulls of strategic cosiness with Donald Trump and trade continuity with Europe. Each choice makes new enemies and limits future choices. Johnson's method so far has been to campaign against the very idea that government is difficult. It is certainly easier without effective opposition, but that advantage cannot endure forever. The price of victory on a promise to 'get Brexit done'is getting it done. On Friday we cross the threshold where Brexit must breathe the same air as other political projects. It sheds the immunity of abstraction and enters the realm of evidence. There will be no bracing inrush of liberty to get leaver hearts pumping, and no sudden cataclysm to vindicate remainers. If ending EU membership proves to be a mistake it will be a gradual tightening, a slow burn; the kind of problem that is easier to deny than to own. Massive, not obvious.

Got Brexit Done': Tory party sells £12 tea towel in celebration,0.125,Positive,"Downing Street might be quietly warning Conservative Brexiters against overt triumphalism before Friday's departure from the EU, but the message has not seemingly reached party HQ, which has launched a range of merchandise with the slogan 'Got Brexit Done'ù. Among the offerings is a £12 tea towel showing the slogan above an image of Boris Johnson flanked by a union flag and Britannia-style shield. Around the edge the departure date is spelled out in Latin: 'XXXI Jan - Anno MMXX'ù. For £15 you can get a blue-and-white mug with a more personal, 'I got Brexit done!'slogan, and the date. Like the tea towel, it is billed by the website as 'PROUDLY printed in the UK'ù. Mimicking the Johnson-and-shield design of the tea towel, a fridge magnet with the slogan costs £6. The website says: 'These OFFICIAL fridge magnets represent a momentous new chapter in the UK's history, and make fantastic keepsakes or gifts for friends and family.'Cheapest of all is an 'I got Brexit done'lapel pin, showing a union flag and the departure date. 'People like you have allowed us to make good on our promises, and deliver on the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union,'the website says. 'So buy our official lapel pin now to celebrate this amazing accomplishment, and our bright future ahead!'Downing Street is marking the moment of departure at 11pm on Friday with relatively low-key events such as union flags being flown and buildings being illuminated - but no Big Ben chimes from the under-restoration parliament clock tower, despite protestations from Brexiters. While the new departure date has been known since October, when the prime minister grudgingly sent the EU an unsigned letter to comply with a backbench-instigated bill mandating a new extension, it seems Conservative central office has not planned its memorabilia in time. Small print under each item says: 'Please note: delivery of our Got Brexit Done collection will begin week commencing 10th February.'",-0.5,Negative
Britain could lose access to EU data after series of scandals,-0.625,Negative,"ÔªøBritish hopes of maintaining a post-Brexit flow of data with the EU, judged vital for security and the economy, have been thrown into doubt after a behind-the-scenes intervention from the Netherlands over Britain's record in protecting personal information. As the UK prepares to leave the EU at 11pm on Friday, it can be revealed that the UK's closest ally in the bloc raised concerns over the robustness of British checks and controls after a series of scandals, including abuse of an EU system for monitoring the movement of people at borders. According to a minute of a board meeting of the UK's Acro criminal records office - deleted from publicly available archives after the Guardian posed questions to the Home Office - the Netherlands made its issues with the UK known last year. The UK had been seeking to share criminal convictions data outside EU structures in the event of a no-deal exit but both the Netherlands and France declined to be involved. 'France are currently not engaging for political reasons, and Holland will not engage due to concerns around the UK's data adequacy status,'the minute records. The doubts held by the Dutch over the UK's record offers compelling evidence that the current flow of data with the rest of the EU could be in peril. The European commission is expected to make a so-called adequacy decision this year to potentially allow Britain's security services and industry to continue to benefit from the transfer of vast volumes of personal data across Europe after Brexit. The political declaration - a document agreed by the EU and the UK as a guide to this year's negotiations on the future relationship - states that 'adequate protection of personal data'is an 'essential prerequisite'for 'enabling the cooperation envisaged by the parties'ù. The member states will agree on the adequacy of the UK's protections of European citizens data by qualified majority, meaning that more than half of the member states must give their approval. This month the European parliament's justice and home affairs committee was provided with evidence of 'deliberate violations and abuse'by the UK of the Schengen Information System (SIS), an EU database used by police and border guards across the border-free Schengen zone. The British authorities had made 'unlawful'full or partial copies of the database that were said by an EU report to pose 'serious and immediate risks to the integrity and security of SIS data'ù. The Guardian has also revealed in recent weeks that the UK failed to pass on the details of 75,000 convictions of foreign criminals to their home EU countries and concealed the scandal for fear of damaging Britain's reputation. A police national computer error went undetected for five years, during which one in three alerts on offenders - potentially including murderers and rapists - were not sent to EU member states. The Home Office opted not to inform its partners due to 'reputational damage'ù. A Dutch government spokesman said: 'Given the broad and comprehensive ambitious relationship that the Netherlands strives for with the UK in the field of internal security, there must be absolute trust in each other's practices and systems. 'The SIS case only serves to underline this. Given its ambitions the Netherlands actively supports the commission's approach to achieve an adequacy decision with the UK on data protection in the field of security cooperation.'The Labour peer Lord Kennedy of Southwark, who has pressed for a government inquiry into the latest data failings by the UK government, said: 'This latest revelation is deeply concerning and highlights the complete loss of confidence other partners have in the UK in respect of data handling and our data adequacy in general. 'The only people this sorry situation benefits is criminals. What is needed is an urgent inquiry to establish what are the failings, how they were allowed to happen and to set out a programme to regain the trust and confidence of partners.'A Home Office spokesperson said: 'These were discussions about a no-deal Brexit and are no longer relevant for 31 January. We have some of the highest levels of data protection in the world and are fully committed to meeting our legal obligations. We have a very close security partnership with EU countries, and are engaging with the commission on our future data-sharing arrangements.'",0.125,Positive
Brexit Britain may soon find itself sinking faster than Venice,-0.125,Negative,"One of the privileges of my trade is that the best seminars often take place in the best places. I no longer attend the Davos World Economic Forum but last weekend marked the 25th annual seminar for British and Italian journalists hosted by the Italian government in - well, Venice. Before I left, several people asked why I was going, because pictures of Venice under water had been flashed around the world. 'Climate change, global warming'seemed to be the general verdict. However, the climate crisis should not be confused with the tidal pattern that Venice has experienced for centuries - duckboards make a regular appearance when the high tide comes in. Venice, like so many places, is unquestionably vulnerable to the climate crisis, but I can report that the streets were clear of water and duckboards last weekend. Instead of worrying, as they usually do, that there were too many tourists, the city authorities were actually expressing concern that the bad publicity had damaged the tourist industry. The Venice seminar embraces many political, diplomatic and economic issues, but regular readers will not be surprised that, for me, one of the most interesting aspects was the sadness the Italians present expressed about the UK's departure from the European Union. Last year, the hope was that this country would have second thoughts and recognise how much it stood to lose by honouring a referendum result that principally reflected dissatisfaction with many things other than the EU. This year, the mood was that we all had to make the best of it, given the long history of close ties between the UK and Italy over centuries. Italy, of course, was a founder member of what was then the European Economic Community. It was not for nothing that the 1957 treaty was signed in Rome. Italy joined the European exchange rate mechanism in 1979 when the UK declined. It also joined the eurozone - the single currency - in 1999. Both decisions were, to my mind, justified more by political than economic considerations. Because the country had a chronically higher inflation rate than Germany's, it used to benefit from the freedom to devalue the lira from time to time, in order to maintain its price competitiveness against the Deutschmark in export markets. It is a not-very-well-kept secret that, quite apart from any other problems, the growth rate of the Italian economy suffered for a long time from this loss of exchange rate flexibility vis-a-vis other EU countries. There is little doubt that this was one of the factors behind the rise in Italian populism and the desire of populist parties to leave the eurozone. But I get the impression that the powers that be think - or at least want to believe - that the economy has to some extent adapted to the rigours of the eurozone and been showing some resilience. Which brings me back to this benighted land that has been captured by the Brexiters. Is this economy going to show some resilience in the face of what, frankly, I still regard as a potential economic catastrophe? In my last column I expressed the hope that Boris Johnson would see sense, ensure that this would be 'Brexit in name only'and that we should, in our own interest, keep close to the customs union and the single market after this year's transition period. But the new chancellor, Sajid Javid, has abandoned the sensible close alignment policy of his predecessor, Philip Hammond - that seems such along time ago! - and has proclaimed: 'There will not be alignment, we will not be a rule taker, we will not be in the single market and we will not be in the customs union.'The government's own internal studies and analysis point to a severe threat from abandoning the single market, which was one of the key attractions for foreign companies, not least the Japanese, to invest in those parts of the Midlands and northern England where 'getting Brexit done'has proved such a compelling slogan. (By the way, there is nothing new about working-class people voting Conservative!) On the face of it, the Johnson/Cummings government wants to address those discontents which, ironically, brought it to power via Brexit. Dominic Cummings, Johnson's chief adviser, wants to end austerity, improve the NHS and satisfy the so-called left behind. Let us hope they can do this. But it is a mammoth task when they are simultaneously making the country poorer. Already a study by Bloomberg finds that the cost to the economy of the very approach to Brexit taken over the past three years has equalled the entire accumulated cost of our contributions to the Brussels budget - contributions that often flowed back to us via funds from the European Investment Bank.

Tony Blair and a positive vision of Africa,0.625,Positive,"Peter Beaumont's article (Tony Blair is wrong. Africa won't be the answer to Britain's post-Brexit problems, 21 January) is a wilful misreading of Tony Blair's piece (Britain must open a new chapter in its relationship with Africa, 20 January), and a conflation of British politics post-Brexit with Africa's challenges and opportunities. As a result it paints an entirely negative picture of a continent of over 1 billion people. Of course there are many challenges, but we at the Tony Blair Institute also see the potential to support those people and leaders striving to create a better future, with jobs and prosperity built on the foundations of effective government, investment, infrastructure and public services. We do not argue that Africa is 'the answer to Britain's post-Brexit problems'ù. Indeed the views of Mr Blair - the executive chairman of the Tony Blair Institute - on Brexit are, to say the least, well known.

Boris Johnson says the Erasmus scheme isn't under threat. Do you trust him?,0.125,Positive,"I never thought I'd see a student exchange programme trend on Twitter. People have told stories of studying and working abroad through Erasmus, sharing tales of friendships built, skills learned, and lives changed. Why? Because MPs voted against my amendment to keep the UK in Erasmus after the Brexit transition period. And people are angry. The benefits of Erasmus are so obvious to the thousands of people who take part in the programme. Each year, more than 17,000 students at UK universities study or work abroad as part of their degree. They go because Erasmus has made studying abroad attractive and affordable. The EU gives them a monthly living grant, with young people from low-income backgrounds receiving higher bursaries and travel grants. It really is an opportunity for everyone. College students, apprentices, adult learners, schools, youth programmes and teachers can all take part. Erasmus not only funds study abroad opportunities, but teacher training, partnerships between universities and colleges, as well as schemes to share best practice in education and youth policy. Students who take part are more likely to find a job after graduating. One in three students who work during their placement get a job with their placement company after they graduate. But what people remember most about studying abroad normally isn't that they increased their employment prospects. They recall learning a new language, falling in love with the culture and building new friendships. By voting against the Liberal Democrats' amendment last week, Conservative MPs showed they are at least prepared to throw away all these benefits. It is devastating. But the fight is not over. For a start, we're trying again in the House of Lords. Today my colleague Mike Storey is expected to propose another amendment to keep the UK in Erasmus. It's already been backed by crossbench and Green peers. But there's another reason to keep fighting. I don't think the government has made up its mind about whether to stay in Erasmus or not. At prime minister's questions on Wednesday, Boris Johnson downplayed fears. 'There is no threat to the Erasmus scheme,'he told MPs. 'UK students will continue to be able to enjoy the benefits of exchanges with our European friends and partners.'Certainly, the Brexit deal leaves open the door to the UK staying in Erasmus. Why then, just 24 hours earlier, did the secretary of state for education, Gavin Williamson, send out mixed signals? He told the Commons that Erasmus membership 'will be a question for further negotiations'and that the UK would 'develop our own alternative arrangements should they be needed'ù. You would have thought that, three and a half years after the referendum, the government might have a clear position. But we're reliant instead on the comments of a prime minister who has form in getting into trouble over off-the-cuff remarks. If Erasmus is really not under threat, why were Conservative MPs ordered to vote down our amendment last week? The prime minister must now back up his words with actions. Universities warn that a UK-led replacement would find it impossible to match the reputation, brand awareness and sheer scale of Erasmus. We need a clear, unambiguous promise from the government to negotiate to remain a full member. The sad truth is that we may never get any certainty about the government's plans until it's too late. Before the general election, the EU withdrawal agreement bill included a section forcing the government to publish its negotiating objectives. Now, that safeguard is gone. The government can negotiate what it likes, and Tory MPs will blindly vote for what's in front of them. Staying in Erasmus should be a no-brainer, yet we have a fight on our hands to save it. Liberal Democrats will campaign relentlessly to stop the Conservatives taking us out of Erasmus and many other vital EU programmes. We will not lot Boris Johnson weaken our education system and limit the horizons of our young people. Layla Moran is education spokesperson for the Lib Dems ",-0.375,Negative
Sir Patrick Stewart speaks of Brexit sorrow at Star Trek launch,-0.625,Negative,"At 79, Sir Patrick Stewart is back in the role of Jean-Luc Picard, and boldly going somewhere no USS Enterprise captain has gone before - their own Star Trek spin-off show. But it was terrestrial matters that were concerning him more at the London premiere of the new series Star Trek: Picard on Wednesday night, where he described Brexit as 'the grimmest thing'to have happened to him in his political life.'It makes me very, very sad,'Stewart told PA Media. 'I think what is happening with the European Union is actually the saddest, grimmest thing that has happened to me since I have been involved in politics.'ùHaving first played the part of Picard when Star Trek: The Next Generation hit screens in 1987, the new web television series sees him return to the role after a gap of 18 years. Stewart says he had met the producers of new show intent to turn them down face-to-face, only to find their ideas for how the character of Jean-Luc Picard had developed compelling. 'I began to realise it was something I had to do, and what a smart decision. There was a quality about Jean-Luc Picard that I had felt from the very beginning that was unlike any acting experience I had before.'The actor, who has been vocal in his opposition to Brexit, has ditched plans to try and gain US citizenship in order to vote against Donald Trump. Speaking on the Star Trek-themed white carpet outside the event in London's Leicester Square, he said: 'I think we have our own Trump in our country here today, so I am going to be using my vote to try and get rid of him.'ùStar Trek: Picard is attempting to be the best of both worlds to Trekkers old and new. It brings back some much-loved characters, piquing the interest perhaps of a generation of 90s fans who had fallen by the wayside. But it also puts them firmly in the current Star Trek universe, with the kind of cinematography and sleek special effects you'd expect from a high budget production made for the streaming TV era.And to celebrate the launch London Underground's Piccadilly Circus station was rebranded as 'òPicard-illy Circus', complete with Starfleet insignia on the famous roundels.  While Stewart may be being made very sad by Brexit, his spirits were lifted by long-time friend Sir Ian McKellen, who jokingly proposed to him outside the premiere. Jeri Ryan, who reprises her role as Seven Of Nine in the new show, said of it that 'Old fans will be happy, and people who might not think they want to watch Star Trek will impressed'ù.Internationally Star Trek: Picard will be streaming on Amazon Prime Video from 24 January, a day after its first US showing on the CBS All Access streaming service in the US ",0.75,Positive
"Brexit: Irish border issue could land UK in court, report finds",0.125,Positive,"The Irish border could yet snag Boris Johnson's Brexit deal, with experts saying it will be impossible to deliver the computer systems for the special arrangements for Northern Ireland by the end of this year. Failure to implement the new systems will risk legal action by the European commission against Britain, the Institute for Government says. In a new report, it says: 'The [Brexit] deal has the support of no Northern Irish political parties and it looks almost impossible to complete the practical changes, for government and business, by the end of the year. Failure to comply with the withdrawal agreement could see the European commission begin infringement proceedings and the UK ending up at the ECJ [European court of justice].'Johnson's government remains adamant that there will be no checks or new reporting systems on trade crossing the Irish sea, despite Ireland and the EU insisting that those would have to be in place to protect the Irish border. The prime minister's intention to establish a trade deal with the EU by the end of December 2020 was also dealt a blow by Simon Coveney, Ireland's deputy prime minister, at the weekend as he indicated the bloc would be in no rush to work to Johnson's timetable. In a blunt assessment of the likelihood of satisfying Johnson's 'ambitious'vision, he said the fact that Britain had put the timescale for a trade deal into law did not mean the other 27 European countries would fall in line. 'In my view, it's probably going to take longer than a year,'he said. The IfG's report says HMRC has previously stated similar systems to the proposed customs arrangements for Northern Ireland would take five years to develop and implement. Part of the problem is that until the new trade deal between the UK and the EU is struck, the details of the Northern Ireland arrangements cannot be finalised. The complicated system for Northern Ireland involves the region effectively staying in the single market but in the UK customs zone. This potentially means tariff charges and rebates, paperwork and physical checks on certain fresh foods and live animals going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. In the new report, 'Getting Brexit done: what happens now?'ù, the IfG says Brexit will be far from done on 31 January when the UK formally leaves the EU with the expected ratification of the withdrawal agreement ending the article 50 process. 'The UK will formally leave the EU at the end of January, and in that sense Brexit will be done, but many of the biggest Brexit jobs will be far from over,'it says. 'It will continue to dominate government for years to come. The prime minister may hope to end Brexit's dominance in the public debate after 31 January, but in Whitehall it will continue to be the biggest and most challenging task faced by a government in decades.'Under the deal sealed by Johnson with the EU last October, animals and fresh food going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to some physical checks, with a tariff and tariff rebate system operating for the first time. These are there to protect any substandard goods seeping into the EU's single market through smuggling over the Irish border into the Republic of Ireland. While all sides recognise the complexities of the new system, little public attention has been paid to the fact that new computer systems cannot be designed by either HMRC, ferry companies, or manufacturers or suppliers like Tesco until the trade deal with the EU is done. The report says: 'With the details of how the border will operate still unclear - and likely to be so for some months - and no preparatory work having happened for checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the 11-month timeline is almost certainly undeliverable.'It notes that Sir Jon Thompson, a former chief executive of HMRC, said that a similar customs systems involving rebates could take up to five years to develop and implement. Coveney issued his warning on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, saying the deal to be struck between the UK and EU over their future relationship was vast, encompassing security, data, aviation and trade. He said: 'When people talk about the future relationship in the UK in particular, they seem to only talk about a future trade agreement. Actually, there's much more to this than that '¶ I know that Johnson has set a very ambitious timetable to get this done - he's even put it into British law - but just because a British parliament decides that British law says something, doesn't mean that that law applies to the other 27 countries of the European Union. 'And so the European Union will approach this on the basis of getting the best deal possible, a fair and balanced deal, to ensure that the UK and the EU can interact as friends in the future. But the EU will not be rushed on this just because Britain passes a law.'",-0.5,Negative
Brexit department ends - not with a bang but airbrushed out,0.5,Positive,"From 31 January any mention of the word Brexit will officially be punishable by death. Anyone who is even suspected of thinking about Brexit will be condemned to a public show trial. As far as the government is concerned, the UK will have left the EU and that's an end to it. Even to discuss the details of a future arrangement will be considered grossly unpatriotic, with offenders being sent to re-education camps. This is the way the Brexit department ends. Not with a bang, but by being airbrushed out of history. And to mark the occasion of his department's final question session in the Commons, Stephen Barclay was determined to end his ministerial career as he had started it - with complete and utter anonymity. For Barclay it is a matter of pride to never say anything memorable. His whole job as Brexit secretary was to do next to nothing and he has fulfilled the brief superbly. At times he has even uttered sentences that have put himself to sleep. 'Is this the end of the department?'said Hilary Benn plaintively. The chairman of the Brexit select committee can see his own position disappearing at the very moment when he knows his job was really only just beginning. Another reason why Dominic Cummings was so keen to see the end of the Brexit department. Parliamentary scrutiny is for losers. It looks that way, Barclay shrugged. He did not seem unduly bothered that his department was being wound up prematurely. Why should he? He knows there will always be a place in government for someone who can effortlessly fill dead air with even deader air and Boris Johnson is sure to offer him something else. Not least when there are other deadbeats such as Andrea Leadsom and Liz Truss whom he can easily replace. That's one of the joys of the current cabinet. So many jobs, so little talent. Barclay's voice melted into liquid Mogadon as he tried to fill the unforgiving, inconsequential hour. His first task was to reassure everyone on the Tory benches that 'The Word That Couldn't Be Mentioned After 31 January'would be properly celebrated across the nation. Special ales would be brewed, flags would be waved, Big Ben would carry on ringing until the bell became detached from its moorings and the tower was turned to rubble. And from now on, between 11 and 11.30 in the morning, every citizen would be expected to participate in a daily collective act of gratitude for the country's deliverance from the EU by prostrating themselves before statues of a naked baby Boris being swaddled by Classic Dom: The Madomma and Child.  Pulling down his trousers to reveal some Union Jack toilet paper hanging out of his underpants, Tory John Hayes was the first of many to assert that 30 minutes wasn't nearly long enough. Tim Farron briefly chipped in to say that it might be an idea to remember that more people had voted for parties supporting remain than The Word That Couldn't Be Mentioned After 31 January at the recent election, so if the government was serious about uniting the country, a good place to start would be to dial down the triumphalism. Barclay looked astonished, as if it had genuinely never occurred to him that some people might not be entirely jubilant at the UK's departure from the EU, but reluctantly agreed to set up a helpline for traumatised remoaners. An 0800 number, charged at 45p a minute, where callers would be kept on hold for 75 minutes before being told to bugger off by someone in an overseas call centre. Apart from junior minister James Duddridge making a point of rubbishing Dominic Grieve - a particularly graceless piece of grandstanding from a man who has never yet found a principle he wouldn't trade to progress his career - the rest of the session passed with MPs doing little more than going through the motions. The third Brexit minister, Robin Walker, couldn't even be bothered to speak. There again, there wasn't anything to say. The government can now do exactly as it wants and all the sting has gone out of the Brexit debate. Even Keir Starmer sounded only passingly interested as he reminded Barclay that while the government may have won the vote on child migrants - Johnson has enough trouble keeping track of his own children without having to bother about a whole load of Syrian kiddies - Labour had won the moral argument. Then Starmer also has the small matter of a leadership election to concentrate on. Not easy when the congenitally hopeless Barry Gardiner had just thrown a curveball by suggesting he might also stand. Was this Bazza's idea of a joke? It's hard to think of someone who would make a worse Labour leader. Other than Richard Burgon. No wonder Starmer always looks permanently startled. It was a morning of endings. At business questions, there was a rare sighting of Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has been kept hidden since the opening day of the election campaign when he screwed up so catastrophically by revealing his true personality. With an 80-seat majority the ERG are now irrelevant and Jacob's days in cabinet are numbered. Just how toxic he now is was soon apparent. Not one of his colleagues joined him on the frontbench for what is sure to be one of his final appearances as Commons leader. Rees-Mogg tried to make light of his isolation, but the pathos was unavoidable. Hubris has caught up with him. He tried to sound sincere about the Australian bushfires. But everyone knew that what he was really thinking was that the humans, koalas and kangaroos who had been burned to death were just a bit dim. If only he had been there; he would have known exactly how to escape the fires. ",-0.25,Negative
We've reached out since the Brexit vote - it's a shame Johnson hasn't,-0.375,Negative,"I take issue with Boris Johnson's call that we should overcome our divisions on Brexit (Johnson promises opponents he will be 'òa PM for everyone', 1 January). I have always been concerned with social cohesion, which is why I voted to remain in the first place. I, and many others, have also taken time over the last three and a half years to talk to those who voted leave to try to find some common ground, which often was possible. Johnson, on the other hand, has made no attempt to reconcile leavers and remainers. In fact, he seems to have been hellbent on constantly ignoring one big part of the population and only trying to please the other with his hard Brexit. When Norway had an EU referendum with a similarly slim majority to not be a member, they tried to please both sides via the European Economic Area. If this had been attempted here most remainers tell me they would have reluctantly accepted it. This is because life, as they know it, wouldn't change too much and their rights would be retained, even though it seems ludicrous to lose a seat at the table. If you want us to come together, this is where I suggest you start.Louise BrownGateshead, Tyne and Wear '¢ Those who exhort us to put our differences behind us and reach out to people on the other side of the Brexit divide seem to forget that at the end of December 2020 all EU citizens are set to lose many of the rights to which they have grown accustomed. This particularly applies to the millions of EU citizens in the UK, and UK citizens living in the EU. The latter have been largely ignored by the UK media over the last three years. As a couple living in Italy for 12 years, and retiring on UK-earned pensions prior to the referendum, we have lost nearly 20% of our annual income due to the devaluation of sterling since UK citizens voted for Brexit in June 2016. During these turbulent three-and-a-half years there has been no hostility shown to us by Italians and other EU neighbours, only friendship and incredulity at the referendum result. As well as the loss of income, we worry about healthcare in our adopted country, and the unresolved question of whether we will receive annual increases to our state pensions in line with inflation. This should not be a worry for two professional people (a doctor and a teacher) who have paid taxes and national insurance in the UK throughout our 40-year working lives. Neither Theresa May nor Boris Johnson have 'reached out'with assurances on these issues.

Jordi Casamitjana claims he was unfairly sacked by animal charity the League Against Cruel Sports (LACS) for complaining that its pension fund invested in companies involved in animal testing. The ruling is the first stage of the case, which will now determine the lawfulness of the dismissal. (LACS argues that Casamitjana was sacked for misconduct.) But what, exactly, is 'ethical veganism'ù? I thought this mindset (rejecting all animal products and animal exploitation, in all aspects of life) was just veganism 101. Is 'unethical veganism'a thing now? Or, like myself (a dairy-dabbling vegetarian), are some vegans just not ethical enough? These days, ethical veganism could prove useful as a cultural clarifier, especially at this time of year when temporary vegans are out in force. Veganuary (people going vegan for January) is great, as is the movement's growing popularity. However, increasingly, there appears to be a huge philosophical gulf between lifestyle vegans and what I'd term True Vegans. Lifelong vegetarians like myself may even feel that we have more in common with True Vegans, in that, for us, it was never about looks, health, dietary fashions or even laudable environmental concerns, however interlinked - it was always just about the animals. For its part, veganism could be getting a bit too slack and undiscerning about who it lets into the fold. I mean, who isn't vegan in some way these days? There are people who are vegan for a month. People who go vegan to lose weight or to improve fitness. Last week, there were probably people feeling 'extremely vegan'in the time it took them to eat the new Greggs' vegan steak bake. That's the essence of mainstream vegan success - it took 'dull and worthy'out of the ethical equation for people who weren't terribly interested, which is fantastic. Mostly. Just sometimes, it feels gratingly lightweight. Maybe that's why I got a kick out of seeing someone take their veganism all the way to court. Go, ethical vegan! Mock these people all you like, roll your eyes at them for being cranks and bores. But there's no denying that they're the real vegan deal - a breed apart in terms of commitment, application and integrity. True Vegans are where it all started. It was their ethical purity (if you like) that made the vegan revolution happen - their persistence that eventually led to jackfruit dals in supermarkets. And they'll still be there, grimly soaking their lentils, when all the faddists and part-timers have gone and the steak bakes are left going cold on Greggs' counter. If vegans are finally getting legal recognition and protection, then they've earned it. Sometimes, it should be about the ethics. The government has announced a £4m fund to pursue rogue private landlords. Is this some kind of joke? There are 4.5m privately rented households in the UK and 1.2m in England and Wales are deemed 'non-decent'ù. With these numbers, how could a one-off splash of £4m even start to resolve the issues? Among the local authorities to benefit from the fund, Northampton plans to set up a special unit to deal with bad landlords, while councils in Yorkshire and the Humber are training enforcement officers to vet properties. I'm sure these councils are grateful to receive the funding, but what about the help and support needed for all the other struggling private renters around the UK? It's highly probable that there are even more of these 'non-decent'abodes, not least because many tenants are too frightened to complain about poor conditions, rent rises or appalling behaviour by landlords. To do so risks eviction.  Labour has called the fund 'puny'and 'a drop in the ocean'compared to council cuts since 2010. These cuts limit their power to act, allow landlords to do as they like and have long been cited as a major reason why the private rental sector has morphed into a housing wild west. Even private landlords think£4m is too little to tackle the rogues who give them a bad name. The government knows all this. It knows occasional cash splurges can't begin to solve the problems of exploitative rental tenancies. So, why send out the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, to announce this shredded fig leaf right at the start of the year - were they hoping that people would still be too hazy from the festivities to realise that their intelligence is being insulted? What is it about Tory Leaver types that make them such bad winners? I wondered whether to bother reacting to Boris Johnson's 'let's be friends'New Year's Day message. Such brazen trolling of Remainer/non-Tory voters requires scant translation, but here goes: 'Dark Overlord II here (we all know that the Domster is Dark Overlord I). Sure, I caused most of the Brexit aggro, but now let the country come together (to forgive me). As friends and equals (well, sort of - there is a limit). Let's forget the unpleasantness (caused by me) and let me (ME!) proceed unhindered, without your loser carping ruining the optics for my World King gig. PS: oops, almost forgot - Get Brexit Done.'This is what I mean about bad winners. It's not enough for them to win, they must gloat, preen, gush with smirking faux-magnanimity, use an olive branch to poke and goad, return to the scene of the crime to give the body another kick. As I so often think, regarding Johnson and Cummings, what would a good, responsible parent do? Perhaps it's best to stop rewarding bad behaviour with attention - don't get angry, which is just playing straight into their hands. We must pity them, poor things, for their lack of grace, their evident inability to cope with getting everything they ever wanted. '¢ Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist ",0.25,Positive
Brexit: 10 things UK citizens can still do in the EU after 31 January,-0.125,Negative,"With the UK's departure date from the EU now effectively set in stone, 31 January will be a historic day. The article 50 process will have been completed and the country will no longer be in the EU. However funereal those who wished to stay in the EU may be feeling there will still be time to enjoy the rights of EU citizens because the UK will remain part of the single market for another 11 months. Here are some things you can still do in 2020 because of the transition period. You can still travel to any EU member state up to 31 December 2020 with no impediments such as visas. After Brexit it is likely that visa-free trips will continue for stays of up to 90 days. The European health insurance card that gives health cover for tourists in another member state still applies. Some might have fond memories of formative weeks and months working on the continent as a student, whether waiting in a restaurant, working in a factory, childminding in the Med, or working in a holiday resort in Spain. During the transition period, students and any other workers will still have the right to work in another member state. This is because freedom of movement rules, which includes freedom of movement of labour, still pertain while the UK is in the single market. Freedom of movement is likely to end on 31 December next year. For the same reason, British citizens will still be eligible for full time positions in the EU. After Brexit, some countries will discriminate in favour of EU candidates. Some of those that have dreamed of retiring to the EU at some point are already speeding up their plans to get in before the drawbridge goes up. As part of the withdrawal agreement, British citizens who are settled - whether working or retired - in the EU before the end of the transition period will retain most of their rights as EU citizens for the remainder of their lives. The key rights that have yet to be negotiated include the continued right of British settled in the EU to move for work, leisure or retirement within the EU. About 17,000 British students studied in another member state according to the most recent data for 2017/2018. Most of the university places for 2020 are already allocated but places are still available for further education college students and apprentices who are eligible for work placements of between two weeks to three months. It is hoped that Erasmus will continue after Brexit but this depends on negotiations on the future relationship with the EU. British citizens will still be able to apply for funding in Horizon2020 programmes during the transition period. Eligibility will also still apply for European regional development funds and European social funds, which have been important sources for infrastructure and environment developments in rural areas and for many not-for-profit organisations seeking to help people into employment in impoverished areas. The EU's Creative Europe funding stream will remain open to British applications. Also promising a call for applications in 2020 is IPortunus, a new EU mobility fund for artists . British writer Melissa Harrison won the UK's European prize for literature in 2019 for Among the Barley, a novel exploring the dangers of nationalism and xenophobia. The prize fund is open in 2020 to British citizens. EU citizens have the right to access healthcare in any EU country and to be reimbursed for care abroad by their home country. This is in addition to the emergency healthcare for tourists under the Ehic system. Little is written about cross-border healthcare, or the processes involved but it is still available during the transition period, says the EU. The NHS's guide to getting treatment abroad is here while the EU's overview is here. The EU's guide to rights for UK and EU citizens during the transition period is available online. This is a handy guide published in 2018 but which still applies, outlining various scenarios. '¢ This article was amended on 31 December 2019.

Michael Howard claims judges 'distorted' law in prorogation ruling,0.125,Positive,"The former Tory leader Michael Howard has criticised the supreme court for ruling that Boris Johnson's prorogation of parliament was 'unlawful'and called for a reform of the judiciary. Judges in England and Wales have long been permitted to interpret law on a case-by-case basis, although they are bound by precedent, but Howard claimed that they sometimes 'distort'law to 'reach the result they want to achieve'ù. In comments which will be seen as part of growing calls for judicial reform within the Conservative party, Lord Howard of Lympne - a former barrister - alleged that judges have 'increasingly substituted their own view of what is right for the view of parliament and of ministers'ù. 'The question is who should make the law by which we are ruled. Should it be made by elected accountable politicians answerable to their constituents and vulnerable to summary dismissal at elections,'he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'What we've seen in recent years is a very considerable increase in the power of the judiciary, partly as a result of the expansion of judicial review.'He said judges were invited by parliament under the Human Rights Act to 'enter the political arena'ù, including by considering whether 'measures that parliament had taken to deal with a particular problem were proportionate to the objectives they wanted to achieve'ù. Howard added: 'So, those two things have led to a significant increase in the power of the judges at the expense of parliament and indeed government '¶ Sometimes in order to reach the result they want to achieve, they '¶ distort the meaning of the act of parliament of which they are interpreting.'He went on to question whether it should be elected politicians or unelected judges who make the law, saying the law states that parliamentary proceedings should not be impeached in any court. But he noted that the outgoing supreme court president Lady Hale had said that because prorogation was not a decision of parliament, it did not amount to a proceeding. 'Prorogation was clearly, of any ordinary view of the language, a proceeding in parliament,'he said. Asked if the supreme court's ruling was a political act, he replied: 'I think that judges have increasingly substituted their own view of what is right for the view of parliament and of ministers. 'The excellent Policy Exchange paper to which I have written the foreword makes some sensible suggestions for redressing the balance.'The paper by the thinktank which has long protected the identities of its donors was published on Saturday. It is entitled 'Protecting the Constitution'ù, and calls for the reinstatement of limits on judicial power and the restoration of the political constitution. The Today programme show, guest edited by Charles Moore, the former Daily Telegraph editor, had asked whether judges were too powerful and sought 'to do things that should be left to politicians acting on behalf of the public'ù. The government has refused to rule out changes to the way judges in the court are appointed after it announced plans in the Queen's Speech for a 'constitution, democracy and rights commission'ù. The move was seen by some at Westminster as an attempt by the prime minister to exact revenge after the court's ruling on prorogation. Johnson has previously hinted at US-style confirmation hearings for supreme court justices, suggesting they should be subject to 'some form of accountability'ù. On Friday, Hale warned against any attempt by minsters to 'politicise'the judiciary following a series of controversial rulings by the supreme court. 'We have an independent, merit-based appointments system which most of us are extremely comfortable with,'she told the Today programme. 'We don't want to be politicised, we don't decide political questions, we decide legal questions. In any event, parliament always has the last word. 'We are not politically motivated. I do not know the political opinions of my colleagues and they do not know mine, and long may it remain so.'",-0.125,Negative
"The Guardian view on the Bank of England: new boss, new thinking?",0.75,Positive,"The appointment of Andrew Bailey as governor of the Bank of England is a safety-first move. The central banker knows his way around the City and it is reasonable to assume that he can stand up for the finance sector in the coming years of tough negotiations with Brussels. Mr Bailey has made a point of saying that Britain, home to Europe's largest financial centre, must not become a 'taker'of EU rules after it leaves the bloc. Tellingly, he is viewed by former Treasury chiefs as 'one of us'ù. But is this enough, given the age we live in? The last three Bank of England governors have been big figures on the international stage, with the incumbent, Mark Carney, being a central banker whose words move markets. Mr Bailey, for all that he is an insider's insider, is not in the same mould. Britain ducked its chance to hire such a transformational figure, which is strange given what lies ahead. We are all born with imperfect foresight, but there are three dangers to the country's economy clearly visible on the horizon: Brexit, climate change and the next recession. We know next to nothing about Mr Bailey's thoughts on how to deal with these. Since 2016 Mr Bailey has run the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority. While his predecessor fined banks billions of dollars for trying to rig interest-rate benchmarks and foreign exchange markets, Mr Bailey took a softly-softly approach to the City. A key review into banking culture seen as core to restoring trust in banks disappeared with this new outlook. Earlier this month, a representative of victims of a City mini-bond scandal walked out of a meeting with Mr Bailey, accusing the FCA of not holding to account the financial firms it regulates under his stewardship. Whistleblowers say he failed to investigate alleged wrongdoing in high-street banks. He also was criticised by MPs for allowing banks 'to continue to rip people off'when the regulator's review of high-cost credit fell short of capping onerous rates. The view is that he backed the City over the consumer. Being governor of the Bank is no easy task; it requires both genuine insight of market operations as well as a political sense of where the Treasury is going. Though nominally independent, the Bank and No 11 work hand in glove on a daily basis. Mr Bailey was part of the Bank's inner circle in the summer of 2007 when it 'had not identified any looming gaps'in its assessment of risks to financial stability. Three months later Northern Rock approached the Bank for a 'liquidity support facility'ù, and the financial crisis in the UK began. Mr Bailey will not want to miss the next crisis. Brexit is likely to strip away the mystery from central banking. The harder the departure from the EU, the more likely that the economy will need a stimulus. The Bank has little room to cut rates much more. Instead the Treasury will almost certainly have to step up and spend. The consensus of many economists is that a hard Brexit will require higher levels of spending, deficits and debt. If Britain departs the EU with a 'bare bones'deal with Brussels, then we should also leave behind the 'sound finance'view of the Treasury, which argues that balanced budgets and low government expenditure are required for business confidence. This is an ideological position that ought to be jettisoned. Government borrowing so far stands at £51bn, up £5bn on the same figure last year. A recession, Brexit and climate change will need greater government spending and a framework to handle it. This is Mr Bailey's challenge for the next eight years. He needs to leave behind orthodox thinking. That means understanding that a central bank can do more than set interest rates to achieve an inflation target. It can purchase significant levels of government debt and 'monetise'the government's deficit. The Treasury views this as 'unsound'because it would fuel inflation. Yet the Bank of England has spent £435bn in a not dissimilar way since 2009 and inflation is flat. Central banking is in danger of becoming a failed paradigm that needs replacing. The question for Mr Bailey is whether he understands that the old way of doing things has become unrealistic and misleading. The answer he gives will be important for his profession - and the country. ",-0.25,Negative
"It was Brexit, not leftwing policies, that lost Labour this election",-0.5,Negative,"For the first time since the 19th century, a British political party has gained seats when seeking a fourth term in office. The Conservatives' share of the vote, 44%, was their highest since 1979, and their seat total - 365 - was their best since 1987. They achieved all of this despite 72% of voters disapproving of the government's performance, despite Boris Johnson's negative approval rating, and despite nine years of austerity. How did this happen? Many observers have declared that the 2019 result was down to the unpopularity of one person - Jeremy Corbyn - and that Labour's leftwing policies meant that the party was unelectable. One problem with this is that Labour's policies are, in fact, overwhelmingly popular: significant majorities of voters support funding the NHS, raising the minimum wage, building council homes and other such social democratic policies. While the evidence shows that Corbyn's leadership was unpopular, this sense of leadership was profoundly linked to his Brexit position, gifting the Conservatives the 'dither and delay'line they were able to use so effectively. And I believe this - Brexit - provides the most plausible way of summing up Labour's defeat in one word. Precisely, the problem was that Labour massively underestimated how much leave voters wanted Brexit, while overestimating how much remainers wanted to stop Brexit. Millions and millions of people still want Britain to leave the EU. In December thus far, remain is averaging 53% and leave is averaging 47% in polls; although remain is ahead in the polls, leave voters showed that they were prepared to vote collectively to ensure that Brexit happens. Remain voters, however, showed that they were not willing to vote collectively to stop Brexit. In 2017, Labour won 41% of the vote by winning the support of 55% of remain voters and 24% of leave voters. In 2019, according to a post-election poll by YouGov, Labour won 49% among remainers (-6pts), with 21% of remainers voting Liberal Democrat (+9pts) and 19% supporting the Conservatives (-6pts). Labour's lead over the Tories among remainers in 2019 (30pts) was thus exactly the same as in 2017 (30pts). But among leave voters, the Conservatives' lead over Labour increased from 41pts to 60pts, with the party winning 74% of the leave vote (+9pts), and just 14% voting for Labour (-10pts). Just 17% of the voters who supported remain in 2016 and Labour in 2017 voted for an explicitly pro-remain party in 2019, that is to say the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, SNP or Green. But 39% of those who voted leave in 2016 and Labour in 2017 supported an explicitly pro-Brexit party in 2019. Meanwhile, of the 54 seats that the Conservatives gained from Labour, 52 of them were in areas that voted leave in 2016; the Tories only gained two seats that voted remain from Labour, both by small margins, and in both of those seats the Green party vote was larger than the Conservative majority. In total, the Tories won 65 seats in which the combined Labour, SNP, Lib Dem, Plaid Cymru and Green vote was larger than the Conservative vote. If remainers had been united, the Conservatives would have won 300 seats and the other parties would have won 331, the 18 Northern Irish MPs and the Speaker making up the rest of the 650. So what can Labour learn for 2024? First, Corbynomics was not the reason for Labour's defeat: 81% of voters support an increase in spending on the NHS, 66% support tax rises for those earning more than £80,000 a year, 66% support building 150,000 council homes and 59% support a green industrial revolution. Labour's policies are popular, and it is worth noting that Labour won more votes with a leftwing manifesto in 2019 than it won with a centrist manifesto in 2015 and 2010. Abandoning Corbyn's policies and returning to a centrist policy agenda will not gain the party votes. The fact that the Lib Dems gained no seats in the 2019 election shows that the electorate has no interest in centrist policies. Second, the 2019 election has effectively made it impossible for Labour to win a majority in 2024. To win 326 seats, Labour would need to gain 124 seats, including 35 seats that it lost by 15pts or more last week. The last time that Labour gained that many seats was in 1997. It is, of course, possible for Labour to return to power as a minority government, but a Labour majority is very unlikely. Third, Labour did not lose as a result of being insufficiently pro-remain. The party's lead over the Conservatives among remain voters (30pts) was unchanged from what it was in 2017, and Labour lost far more leavers than remainers. And of the 124 seats that Labour needs to gain in order to win a majority in 2024, 86 voted leave. Electing a pro-remain centrist as leader is not the solution: Labour must focus on winning back leave voters. Finally, Labour should look to the future; it should not become obsessed with Brexit. The next election will take place four years after Brexit, and the question of whether we will leave or remain will have been definitively settled. Labour will not win in 2024 by quixotically re-running the 2016 referendum over and over again; it will only win if it looks forward to the future, and champions a leftwing vision for Britain's future outside the EU.

"Labour's Brexit position set MPs up to fail, says Lisa Nandy",0.125,Positive,"Labour faces a hard road back in its former heartlands because the party's decision to back a second referendum cemented a sense that it had stopped listening, the potential leadership candidate Lisa Nandy has argued. Nandy, the Wigan MP who served in Jeremy Corbyn's first shadow cabinet, said that offering a softer Brexit was the 'only way that you would have prevented the scale of the collapse'in seats across the north, Midlands and Wales. Speaking to the Guardian in a pub in Wigan, she said it was easy to blame Corbyn and believe that without him 'everything will be resolved'ù. But she said the party's Brexit position was also responsible. 'In all honesty, Brexit just played into the sense that we are adrift from communities like these, that we don't speak for them, we don't stand for them, we don't understand them, and worse than that: we're deeply disrespectful towards them. And that has been building for the last 15 to 20 years,'she said. 'It's been a long time in the making, I hope it won't take a long time to resolve. But it's going to be a hard road back.'Nandy is expected to enter the race to succeed Corbyn as Labour leader in the new year, with rivals likely to include Rebecca Long-Bailey, Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry and Clive Lewis. Starmer, Thornberry and Lewis were all advocates of a second Brexit referendum, and had declared publicly that they would campaign to remain in the EU. But Nandy insisted the policy was a mistake. 'Once we adopted the position of a second referendum, there were a lot of Labour candidates in seats that voted overwhelmingly to leave who knew that they didn't stand a chance of winning the election,'she said. 'More importantly, [they] knew they didn't stand the chance of getting a hearing or gaining the trust of the people in their own communities, including lifelong Labour voters who felt voting Labour was very much part of their identity. And the reason for that was because it was about respect.'In scathing comments about the People's Vote campaign, Nandy said: 'Even the title of it, back home here [in Wigan], said to people that you're not people - you're the wrong people - and the wrong people voted, so we need to get the right people to vote.'She added: 'I suppose one of the great lessons there has to be for the Labour leadership, whoever that may be going forward, is that people are not stupid. They are much, much smarter than you think. And they understand what is happening. And if you say to them that this is simply a question of democracy, but the only right option is to remain, they can see right through that.'Nandy also echoed criticisms made by other leadership hopefuls about Labour's manifesto, which she said included policies that did not seem relevant to people's lives. She cited the free broadband policy, which she believes 'missed the mark, for people who are struggling with so many other things in their daily lives at the moment'ù. 'I've got a lot of constituents here who have a pound left in their pocket at the end of the week. And actually, free bus travel would go a lot further than free broadband,'she said. Nandy also said she thought Labour's re-nationalisation agenda had gone too far. She said she backed the case for nationalising the railways but as a former shadow energy secretary believed there were better ways of improving the energy market than nationalising the gas and power utilities. 'If I'm honest, I think nationalising the energy companies is a waste of money. Disrupting them by setting up municipal energy companies [and] energy co-ops around the country is a much better route,'she said. Nandy, who is 'seriously thinking'about standing for the leadership, is considered to be on the soft left of the party and was cautious about being too critical of Corbyn or his supporters in Momentum. Like Starmer, she said it was important not to 'throw out everything that's happened'since Corbyn became leader and to keep the 'decisive break that we made in 2015, where we said that we will be much less cautious about state intervention, wearing our values on our sleeve and taking on what has long been held to be deeply unpopular issues like compassion towards refugees'ù. But she said any new leader would have to confront the 'devastating'impact of Labour's failure to get to grips with the problem of antisemitism within its ranks, which had caused people to lose trust in the party. Although she resigned from the shadow cabinet in 2016 and supported Owen Smith's leadership bid against Corbyn, Nandy said she had only done so after going to see the leader with others from her wing of the party to try to find a compromise. 'One side had picked a fight and the other side was absolutely determined to fight it until one or the other and been smashed. And I could see where that was heading. You can't win elections like that,'she said. Nandy said that in 2010 she had been considered too leftwing to serve on Ed Miliband's team but that it was not helpful to think of people as part of one faction or other. She said her own influences as a politician range from her Marxist father to her grandfather who was a Liberal MP, then peer. Nandy, who wants to move Labour's headquarters out of central London and its party conference out of cities, said devolving power to communities and local authorities was the only real way that people would feel they had control over their lives again. 'The only answer is to give communities power to make decisions for themselves,'she said, citing Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham's free bus pass for older teenagers as a big success. Nandy said the Vote Leave campaign's 'Take Back Control'slogan had 'caught the mood in towns like Wigan, like no other slogan in our lifetimes'and 'just really, really resonated with that sense that people had that they couldn't shape the circumstances of their own lives'ù. While the party tries to get back on track, Nandy said the important thing was for every part of Labour to come together and try to unite to thwart a hard Brexit. 'If that's where we're heading - and that is clearly where we're heading - Labour needs to come together now,'she said. 'Leave the culture war behind and start pulling together as a team to see if we can do whatever it takes with the cross-party working with the House of Lords making the case that out in the country, and to prevent the hard Brexit '¶ When jobs start to go, people here will not thank us for having been complicit in a hard Brexit. So we've got to get out there and be vocal and see what we can do to protect people.'",-0.5,Negative
Johnson will break his Brexit promises. Labour must be forensic in exposing this,-0.125,Negative,"Ring out the bells! Brexit is done today, as promised. Or almost done, as first and second readings are dashed through the Johnsonised Commons, disregarding the notion a bill should be published first to allow at least a week to scrutinise it before voting on the second reading. But to hell with rules, precedents, procedure. From now on, the will and whim of Boris Johnson is iron law. By 10 January the withdrawal agreement bill will be through the Commons, and through the Lords in good time for Brexit by 31 January, fulfilling the only election pledge that mattered. Thereafter, the word Brexit is to be banished from his kingdom, Johnson proclaims. (No chance.) Parliament will lose any right to know anything about the progress of the free trade deal that will cement the country's future for decades. Nor will there be any vote on its final terms. Under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act, Johnson could get away with agreeing a treaty in private, with no public news on its progress, allowing one day in parliament to discuss his deal or his no-deal without a vote. And that's that: ultra-hard Brexit or betraying-the-ERG-soft or no deal at all, no one can stop him now. The same will be true of any treaty he strikes with Donald Trump. Except that's not how it will actually be. The progress of talks will leak daily, true or distorted versions stirring fury with one side or the other, one industry or another. The government will deny damaging stories that turn out to be true. Nothing will be resolved until everything is resolved, which means nothing - no deal - is a dangerously plausible result.  Whatever Johnson does, he cannot keep all of his Brexit promises, as gigantic hurdles stand in his way. The most impassable are fisheries, agriculture, finance and Northern Ireland. No fixes and fudges will let him bluster through these. One is of the gravest economic importance, the others are of little financial value but stand at the beating heart of everything Brexit stands for - nation, flag, heritage, identity and independence. Start with the one that is least important economically, but has the greatest emotional tug. Fishers were promised 'instant'escape from the common fisheries policy. The industry provides just 0.5% of GDP, but 100% of the nation's romantic seafaring identity. Total control over our own waters within a 12-mile limit is what the fishers think they were promised, getting back all the quota taken by EU boats: UK boats catch only 40% of tonnage. But here's the real catch - they sell 80% of it to the EU and we import 70% of the fish we like from the EU. The French, Dutch and Spanish feel as passionately patriotic about the seas as we do. No deal on anything without a fisheries deal, they say. They will bar Scottish smoked salmon, which alone is worth more than all other fishing and fish processing. So Johnson must decide - will he sell out the fishers to the vital interests of our pharma, finance or airline routes?  The 80% of our economy devoted to services will get no deal, with a bare-bones, goods-only free trade agreement fixed in 11 months. This will be a slow frog-boiler, banks and finance slipping away quietly, many new HQs already set up in Frankfurt and Paris, new investment not arriving. Predictions vary from a 2% to a 7% loss to GDP. The third gigantic boulder in Johnson's path is still Northern Ireland. The border down the Irish sea, with Northern Ireland in the customs union and the rest of the UK out, will never be accepted by unionists. In today's latest ONS figures, NI came off worst, again: its GDP fell by 1.1% last year. Its industry tussles with what rules and checks will mean, while loyalists warn against Johnson's 'betrayal bill'ù.  Trade talks may take place 'in secret'ù, but Johnson will have no hiding place from any impassable Brexit obstacles. He will be obliged to break impossible promises. It hardly matters where the opposition stands - these contradictions are in-built, recklessly created by his foolish posturing. A soft Brexit, staying closely aligned to the single market and customs union, would resolve most of them, keeping EU rules and regulations. But Johnson seems resolute against that path, a populist following the country's choice of romance over economic well-being. Forget the PM's 'golden age'balderdash: these Brexit pigeons will come home to roost, sooner not later. If Labour wants any role in the country's future, it has to carve out a clear path on what kind of Brexit the UK needs. Fully accepting Brexit will happen doesn't mean kowtowing to a Johnson Brexit. Lexiters on Labour benches, their position expounded by Larry Elliott, may be tempted to embrace any Brexit: after the shock of losing those old Labour Brexit votes, silent capitulation could look tempting. But it is an opposition's duty to expose every weakness in government policy, to shine a light on perils ahead and plot an alternative course. If complicit now, what can Labour say when Brexit wreaks economic havoc, emptying the treasury of funds for spending on parched public services?  The party needs a fearless leader who can be forensic in charting the downward drag of Brexit on every aspect of Britain's fortunes over the next five years. Of course if, against all odds, Brexit turns out to be as 'fantastic'as Johnson and the Lexiters promise, it won't matter what Labour has said. The party will be dead as a door nail for an aeon.

'There's no chance now': how the People's Vote movement died,0.5,Positive,"As political collapses go, it was astonishingly swift. One weekend in October, hundreds of thousands of people had descended on central London to demand a second Brexit referendum. A week later, the cause, the biggest non-party movement in British politics, was effectively dead. The hammer blows came in quick succession: by the following Friday, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP had decided to offer Boris Johnson an early election. Then late on the Sunday night, in a spectacularly ill-timed boardroom coup, two emails told the two organisers of the People's Vote campaign they were fired. People's Vote campaign formally launches in Camden, north London, at an event fronted by four MPs from four different parties: Chuka Umunna, Anna Soubry, Layla Moran and Caroline Lucas. Tens of thousands attend the first People's Vote march in central London, two years after the Brexit referendum, but Labour leadership declines to support a second plebiscite. Labour conference passes Brexit compromise motion. It says that if Theresa May's Brexit deal cannot get through parliament, and a general election cannot be secured, the party must support 'all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote'ù. May's Brexit deal is voted down and a no-confidence motion is lost, but Labour does not immediately move to back a second referendum. The party Change UK is formed with the backing of seven Labour MPs, all of whom support a second referendum. The move prompts Labour's leadership to shift its position towards supporting a public vote. A People's Vote march in central London is attended by 1 million people, according to organisers' estimates, the second biggest demonstration in British history after the march against the Iraq war in 2003. The option of holding a second referendum is defeated in two sets of indicative votes, by 295 to 268 in March, and by 292 to 280 in April. A rump of Labour MPs remain opposed. A People's Vote march in London, coinciding with a special Saturday sitting of parliament, attracts an estimated 100,000 people. The Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party abandon efforts to obtain a second referendum and switch to backing a general election, which is voted through the Commons the following week. Both the director and the communications director of People's Vote are unexpectedly fired after a row over the governance of the organisation. People's Vote staff stage a walkout and the organisation collapses for the duration of the election campaign. The recipients of the emails were a stunned James McGrory, the director of the People's Vote campaign, and its communications director, Tom Baldwin. They were victims of a long-running behind-the-scenes row over governance with the financial PR specialist Roland Rudd, brother of the former cabinet minister Amber. 'If MPs had held their nerve, we could have left Johnson twisting in the wind and eventually secured a majority for a people's vote. But [Lib Dem leader Jo] Swinson effectively destroyed the remain alliance,'Baldwin said. 'Within hours, Roland moved to sack James and me, perhaps in the belief it would silence opposition to what the Lib Dems were doing.'Others involved say that suggestion is too neat and that the election decision was the decisive one. Hugo Dixon, the deputy chairman of People's Vote and an ally of Rudd's, said: 'It was over once the Lib Dems decided to allow Johnson to fight on the terrain of his choice.'The point is arguably demonstrated by the 12 December election outcome. Pro-Brexit parties - the Conservatives, the Brexit party, the DUP and the rump of Ukip - secured 46.5% of the vote; those advocating a second referendum, like Labour, or those wanting to revoke the result of the first one, the Lib Dems, ended up with 52.2%. It is an agonising conclusion to a project whose opportunity first emerged after the 2017 election, when Theresa May lost her majority. Nine months later, the People's Vote campaign emerged: (the name, McGrory says, came from the Green MP Caroline Lucas over an early planning dinner). The first event was held in April 2018 at the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town, London, with the then-Labour MP Chuka Umunna and then-Conservative MP Anna Soubry leading proceedings, although it did not take off until the summer, when tens of thousands attended its first march. Various attempts were made by Umunna and allies for him to chair the organisation early on, but there was sharp pushback elsewhere from people who believed that giving the then-Labour dissident too much power was a mistake. In the end, Umunna, Soubry and others formed the shortlived Change UK - before he defected to the Lib Dems. They also became less involved with People's Vote 'when we told them they could not speak at every event'ù, according to Baldwin. But the Change UK breakaway had one other important effect: prompting Labour's leadership to finally back a second referendum to stop 'a damaging Tory Brexit'ù, closing the gap with the new party. That helped head off Change UK, but there were still not enough votes in parliament, not least because there was a rump of Labour MPs unwilling to back a second referendum. The idea of a confirmatory referendum was defeated by 295 to 268 and again by 292 to 280 in two rounds of indicative votes in March and April. But once May was removed in the summer, the Conservatives began to come together under Johnson and a majority in parliament never materialised. Johnson had managed to negotiate a new Brexit deal, and suddenly all that was blocking it was a procedural delay from the Conservative backbencher Oliver Letwin, which passed on the Saturday of the march, to the delight of the crowds present in Parliament Square. The former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron argues 'there weren't the numbers'in the Commons and that the key moment was when Johnson got MPs to vote for a second reading of his Brexit bill a few days later. An election seemed the only option, the Lib Dem MP said: 'In the end we thought it was the last chance to prevent Brexit.'The Lib Dem decision has been repudiated since the election by former MPs such as Phillip Lee. Others blame hubris in the party, saying it was MPs such as Umunna who helped persuade Swinson to call an election in the belief Labour could be overhauled. In fact, both lost their seats at Westminster. Meanwhile, as the election began, the People's Vote campaign became embroiled in almost Pythonesque squabbling. The operation's 40 staff walked out in sympathy, basing themselves in a nearby pub, the Grosvenor, with the support of a friendly landlord, and engaged in a media war against Rudd. Former staffers, with the support of the likes of Alastair Campbell, attacked Rudd, drawing attention to his £5.9m salary and £20m west London home (where he had sought planning permission for a staircase into a wine cellar) and accusing him of leading a City-style 'boardroom coup'ù. In turn, the staffers found themselves embroiled in legal disputes - 'I think they were using four different law firms at one point,'says Baldwin - and were accused of failing to properly disclose at least £300,000 of donations to the Electoral Commission, a claim the duo deny. People's Vote did channel some donations to a few supportive candidates and spent just short of £200,000 on Facebook ads. But the Conservatives spent £950,000 and Labour £1.5m, and with its database of 500,000 supporters, People's Vote could have raised more money and been a greater force online. The organisation had intended to launch a 'gold standard'tactical voting website early in the campaign. Instead, another organisation, Best for Britain, stepped into the breach and was immediately accused of favouring the Lib Dems. It recommended that people vote against Labour in Kensington, a seat won narrowly by Emma Dent Coad in 2017 by 20 votes from the Conservatives. In 2019, Dent Coad lost by 150, while the third-placed Lib Dem candidate, Sam Gyimah, obtained 9,312 votes, prompting recriminations about the advice. But that was only one constituency: up and down the country there was a swing to the pro-Brexit Conservatives, while the Lib Dems lost a seat and not a single pro-remain independent came through. Despite two years of hopes to the contrary, there was no pro-remain surge at the ballot box. Those involved recognise the scale of the defeat. Baldwin has been tipped to join Jess Phillips's campaign to become Labour leader while Dixon thinks it is time to move on. 'There's no chance of stopping Brexit now,'he adds, saying he wants to focus on campaigning around integrity in politics and the future of liberalism. McGrory, a former adviser to Nick Clegg in government who was then involved in the unsuccessful anti-Brexit Stronger In Europe campaign in 2016, wonders if he will stay in politics. 'I'm 37 and politics is all I've known, but maybe my race is run.'Last weekend, after the election, messages went up on connected WhatsApp groups, asking if people were willing to back a new organisation: Rejoin. 'I can't say there was any enthusiasm,'said one campaigner. 'It's over.'",-0.125,Negative
Labour lost its leavers while Tory remainers stayed loyal,-0.5,Negative,"Did Britain finally get its Brexit election? The results on Thursday seem to suggest that this was the case. As seat after seat in the Labour heartlands fell to the Conservatives, the pattern seemed clear: leave areas had backed the Tories. But as more results came in, this pattern proved to be a little more complex. The Conservatives didn't just win in Labour areas with a leave majority - they held on to almost all of their remain seats, too. The Liberal Democrats and the other remain parties outside Scotland failed to gain the key Conservative remain constituencies they had been targeting. If this was the Brexit election, then surely Cheltenham should have been within the Lib Dems' reach? Much has been made of the Brexit identities we now hold. They are supposed to divide us, to trump our party loyalties. But data from the British Election Study suggests that not everyone holds these identities equally strongly. While most people will choose a 'side'of the Brexit debate (hardly surprising when politics has been about little else for the last three years), not everyone feels equally attached to their side. Asked whether they have a 'very strong'ù, 'fairly strong'or 'not very strong'leave or remain identity, the public is quite polarised. Around one in four say they identify very strongly with remain, and a similar proportion very strongly with leave. By the 2017 election, these groups of voters had, to a large extent, already aligned their vote with their Brexit side. Only 13% of very strong remain identifiers voted Conservative, while 17% of very strong leave identifiers voted Labour. It is the varying strength of Brexit identity, and the ways in which it interacts with other political values, that is central to understanding this election. In the early hours of the morning, the first results to declare were concentrated in the north-east, a leave-voting region and one with an imbalance between strong leave and strong remain identity: the proportion of very strong leave identifiers is about eight points higher than that of very strong remain identifiers. This set the narrative for the rest of the night. But why did pro-remain seats such as Cheltenham, Guildford and Lewes continue to support candidates from the Conservatives, a party offering a hard Brexit? In Lewes, the Conservative vote fell by just 1.6 percentage points; in Cheltenham, the party's vote share increased by 1.3 points. The explanation may lie in voters' Brexit identities. Just 7% of Conservative voters in 2017 had a very strong remain identity - whereas 11% of Labour voters had a very strong leave identity, which is what made many of the party's leave seats so vulnerable. Among those with a remain identity who did vote Conservative in 2017, that identity tended to be only weak or fairly strong; among Conservative leave voters, strong identification was more common. Throughout the campaign, data collected by Lord Ashcroft had shown that a substantial majority of these Conservative remain voters were more willing to leave the EU than see the election of a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn. While this shows how worried those voters were about the economic policies Corbyn would usher in, it is clear that their weaker remain identities also played a part. Much will be written about the fall of the Labour leave seats to the Tories and the task for Labour to reconnect with these voters. But it is this asymmetrical realignment that ultimately produced such a large Conservative majority, allowing the party to keep its electoral coalition together while winning over new voters. It was thought that the Conservatives would need to gain leave seats in the north and Midlands to offset the loss of remain seats elsewhere; in the end, they simply piled on more seats, and lost very few. The remain side staked everything on this election as the last chance to stop Brexit. But it lost in dramatic fashion. Some have suggested that the UK has now undergone a fundamental realignment in electoral politics, that the results in Labour heartlands in the north and Midlands echo their disastrous loss of Scotland in 2015. But such talk may be premature. Plenty of voters did stick with their parties. If the Brexit divide, a new dimension of British politics, pulled the Labour electoral coalition apart, then something much older - the economic left-right divide - seems to have helped hold the Conservatives' coalition together. But the Tories' success shouldn't be taken for granted. Depending on how voters experience five years of Conservative-majority government and the fallout from Brexit, that coalition could yet be pulled apart in 2024 - with economically left-leaning voters delivering the heartlands back to Labour.

"Tactical voting sites have spread confusion and animosity. In fact, we don't need them",-0.375,Negative,"It's easy to see why tactical voting appeals to the politically minded. It's a sort of clever hack to try to get round the twin problems of Britain's first-past-the-post voting system and a split vote, usually on the left. The formula is straightforward: in constituencies where it looks like the Conservatives might win with less than 50% of the vote, ignore your first preference and vote for the party that has the best chance of beating them. The trouble is that like so many life hacks, it always turns out to be much more difficult to get right than it might have seemed. For example, getvoting.org, the website run by Best for Britain (a remain-focused campaign group) changed 83 of its constituency recommendations this week. Effectively, it was admitting that in the three weeks since its launch, one in eight of its instructions to voters were wrong. If these recommendations had been carried into a general election, of course, they would have had the opposite effect to the one intended - the 'tactical'equivalent of sending your cavalry to charge the machine guns. This ought to embarrass the people involved. When I was a city analyst, I was mortified on the occasions when I had to change even a single recommendation. But the website's credibility is not so much the issue here. The problem is with the whole concept of tactical voting. When the tactical voting sites were first launched in this election cycle, the most common criticism of them was that they were biased towards the Liberal Democrats, because they seemed to be recommending lots of votes for the party in constituencies where Labour had come second to the Tories in 2017. I think we can now see that this wasn't the case - of the 83 changes made by getvoting.org, 81 of them are to switch the recommendation from Lib Dem to Labour, and one of them is a change of Kensington to 'Too close to call'ù. The problem was that the underlying model was based on a set of constituency-level forecasts, and those forecasts put the Lib Dems in second place in many constituencies because they were based on polling data from a period when the Lib Dems were polling very well. Over the first three weeks of the campaign, the polls have moved substantially, with Labour gaining support and the Lib Dems falling behind, and the getvoting.org model update (based on polling over the last week) reflects that. When other tactical voting sites get updated, they are going to have the same problem. All well and good, but the fact that polls move during a campaign was hardly a surprise, was it? And with a fortnight to go, it's by no means certain that the current recommendations are right, or that the sites won't have to make another 80 changes before polling day. Any one of those changes risks sending tactical votes the wrong way, because voters won't necessarily return to check that the advice they got is still valid. The damage is likely to be small - the sad fact of first-past-the-post is that many of the recommendations are all but irrelevant because most seats are safe. But the risk involved is totally needless. And much more importantly, it has started an equally needless fight with exactly the people the tactical websites needed to convince - passionate Labour supporters. The main consequence of launching based on October data has been to create a lot of ill-feeling for the entire concept of tactical voting. It would have been far better to spend the first month or so publicising the general concept of tactical voting, then coming out a couple of weeks before the election with a fairly reliable set of recommendations that were more likely to be taken in the spirit they were made. The underlying problem seems to be that in the online political era, clever and enthusiastic people seem to choose projects based on what might go viral rather than what really needs to be done. Because nobody really needs one of these websites, let alone three or four competing ones. Anyone who can understand the concept of tactical voting and why they might want to do it is equal to the very easy task of doing their own research (the tactical.vote website even tells you how, in 200 words). People who don't want to vote tactically usually have their own, often strongly felt, reasons for not switching to Labour or the Lib Dems. The idea that there is someone out there who would vote tactically if they could just get a convenient packaged recommendation is basically a myth; such people are really rare. In online conversations with people who volunteer for these projects, the only case I've really heard for them is that they might be helpful if your grandparents ask you how to vote, which is clearly a hopeful daydream. It's the dumb thing that smart people always do - assuming that the only reason other people haven't done what you want is that you haven't explained it to them yet. Unfortunately, politics doesn't really work like that. '¢ Dan Davies is a former Bank of England economist and investment banking analyst ",0.625,Positive
Consider the logistics of shopping online,0.125,Positive,"Samanth Subramanian argues that 'the great trick of online retail has been to get us to do more shopping while thinking less about it - thinking less, in particular, about how our purchases reach our homes'(Deliver us, 21 November).

In a survey of UK adults back in 2009, only 14% claimed to have 'some knowledge'of the 'role of logistics in the economy'ù. When logistics works, which is most of the time, it is taken for granted and ignored. As a result, few people have any sense of the complexity, transport-intensity, environmental impact and social costs of modern supply chains, not just on the 'last mile'but all the way back to the raw material source. Greater public awareness of distribution systems upstream of the home and shop could help to promote more sustainable patterns of consumption and more informed debate on subjects such as Brexit, climate change and the gig economy, all of which have an important logistical dimension.Prof Alan McKinnonK√ºhne Logistics University, Hamburg, Germany '¢ Join the debate - email guardian.letters@theguardian.com '¢ Read more Guardian letters - click here to visit gu.com/letters '¢ Do you have a photo you'd like to share with Guardian readers?

The Guardian view on the Labour manifesto: bold pledges for anxious times,0.125,Positive,"Labour's 2019 general election manifesto, launched on Thursday by Jeremy Corbyn, is its most radical in more than 35 years. It will strike a chord with millions who want categorical change in Britain. The chord will be loudest with those who have seen life chances stall and fracture, and communities weaken, during the fiscally strangulated years that have followed the financial crash. It will ring out, too, for those who want inequality reversed, taxes increased to renew public services and the climate crisis placed at the centre of public policy. The manifesto raises the bar. Its ambitions match the seriousness of the times. The green agenda is the single most important pledge, an overarching imperative. But it is not the only issue the manifesto confronts in bold terms. The neglect of towns and regions, the need for modernised transport and infrastructure, the importance of reskilling, and of rights against employment injustice, the case for affordable housing, the demands for child and elderly care, a better deal in education and health spending all cry out too. The manifesto is not historically as startling as it will be caricatured as being. The Britain that Mr Corbyn and his supporters are imagining is a leftwing form of social democracy for which, with relatively few changes of policy, it might have stood at various times between 1945 and 1983. Mr Corbyn is explicit that he wants to roll back the deregulatory revolution of the 1980s and restore tax and spend, national provision of social goods, and the state-managed sector - issues that were bedrocks of the postwar economic settlement - to the heart of public policy from which Margaret Thatcher expelled them. He wants to see the forward march of labour, which was halted in those years, resumed. But we are on the threshold of the 2020s, not the 1970s. The single most consequential thing that will be decided on 12 December is the enormity of Brexit, which will shape everything else that any new government, Labour or not, attempts in the new decade. Mr Corbyn's Brexit offer is ambiguous. He will not say if he wants Britain to remain in Europe or not - and Labour is badly harmed by his evasion. Mr Corbyn is ambiguous too in his trade union agenda. Yes, employees absolutely need a stronger voice in their workplaces and over their terms and conditions. But what exactly does Labour mean by the repeal of 'anti-trade union legislation'and scrapping 'unnecessary restrictions on industrial action'ù? Over-mighty unions were part of the dark side of the 1970s. Enthusiasm for Labour's general ambitions should not mean a free pass on such issues. Labour's approach speaks to and connects with the deep injustices and unfairnesses of modern Britain. But a manifesto must be more than a utopian wishlist. Planting lots of trees is magnificent. But money does not grow on them. Even in tough times like these, and even in the face of Boris Johnson, a Labour manifesto is only as inspiring as its implementation is credible and as its party leader inspires confidence. Neither of these is a given. Pledges like scrapping universal credit, keeping the state pension age at 66 and abolishing tuition fees will be popular, but they carry big price tags, not all of which will be paid by the super-rich or business. 'These are vast numbers, enormous, colossal,'said the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It added that Labour's claim that only higher earners would pay higher taxes was 'not credible'ù. Mr Corbyn has three weeks to win this argument. Just as questions of affordability cannot be wished away, so Mr Corbyn's net dissatisfaction rating of minus 60 among voters cannot be ignored either. The Labour leader's response on Thursday was to defy such scepticism. He would accept the hostility of the rich and the powerful, he said, echoing Franklin Roosevelt. Current polling suggests that many who are neither rich nor powerful have doubts too. Labour's manifesto may in the end be more effective in consolidating the left's control of the party than in transforming the most important election in decades. Mr Corbyn's manifesto will raise many spirits, as its predecessor did in 2017. The question now is whether its strikingly ambitious radicalism can change the election outcome. ",-0.375,Negative
Stressed Whitehall staff at 'òbreaking point' over Brexit,0.125,Positive,"Rates of work-related stress, depression and anxiety among civil servants has risen drastically in the past year to the highest level for decades, amid warnings that Whitehall will reach 'breaking point'ù. The proportion of civil servants who say they are experiencing stress has increased by 45%, according to official data. Increasing workloads, looming deadlines, departures of senior staff and the pressures around delivering Brexit are all being blamed for the spike. It appears to be the highest rate recorded for any industry since the Health and Safety Executive began collecting these statistics 20 years ago. About 3,230 cases of stress, depression and anxiety per 100,000 workers were recorded for the sector and related jobs, the highest rate of any sector in the UK and around 77% higher than the all-industry average. Unions blamed the figures on increasing workloads, years of pay restraint and the added pressures created by Brexit and political gridlock. Mike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect union, said: 'No other industry has experienced anything like this annual jump, and it is impossible to escape the conclusion that it is because of the sheer level of pressure being heaped on civil servants as a result of Brexit. 'No government in peace time has ever been as reliant on its civil service, keeping the country running and preparing for Brexit, while parliament remains effectively deadlocked. Pay is still lagging behind the private sector, departmental cuts continue to bite, and senior politicians never seem to miss an opportunity to attack civil servants - it's no wonder they are feeling the strain. 'òThe government urgently needs to address this problem or it will soon discover that even our fantastic civil service has a breaking point.'Emma Norris, research director of the Institute for Government thinktank, said she believed the uncertainty and difficulty of Brexit, as well as a high turnover of senior staff, was having an impact. 'Some of this is the sheer workload that the civil service has been subjected to under Brexit,'she said. 'We know that, as a result, some departments have already moved to shift work to try to reduce the hours some people are working - particularly where tight deadlines are involved. 'The phrase we have heard is 'òthe fog of the fortnight ahead' - a constant sense that it is hard to see beyond two weeks or so, with a constant cycle of uncertainty. That can certainly be demoralising and stressful. High turnover is always a big problem in Whitehall. Naturally that is going to have consequences for staff morale.'She said public bodies were taking action. The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs recently made counsellors available for its staff, while others are holding lunchtime sessions on managing intensive workloads and wellbeing. One employee at a government body, who worked as a mental health champion after suffering depression, said he changed jobs to help him deal with his condition. Speaking anonymously, he said that, while mental health awareness was improving, growing workloads could be to blame for the growing number of cases. 'The organisation is making the right noises, but there is a heck of a lot more to do,'he said. 'Quite a few public sector bodies sign up to mental health pledges as a box-ticking exercise, or to give them the kudos of trying to do something. The public-sector pay cap has been key. People do not feel valued. Their pay packets are going down in real terms and they are being asked to do more for less. When someone leaves, instead of that role being filled, people are being asked to take up that work.'A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: 'The Civil Service is taking steps to reduce the stigma around mental health. Supporting the mental health of civil servants is a key priority and a part of our ambition to be the UK's most inclusive employer by 2020.'This article was amended on 18 November 2019 to add a quote from the cabinet office.

Brexit will make all the election spending promises hard to keep,-0.75,Negative,"If the president of the United States, a non-European, feels entitled to air his views about Brexit, I see no reason why the outgoing president of the European council, Donald Tusk - a much more agreeable Donald - should not air his. Quoting Hannah Arendt, Tusk said: 'Things only become irreversible when people start to think so.'Tusk, who rightly thinks the very idea of Brexit is, to quote another US observer, Michael Bloomberg, 'a mistake'ù, says: 'Don't give up.'The whole thrust of Boris Johnson's and his ally (up to a point) Nigel Farage's approach is to make people think the result of the 2016 referendum is 'irreversible'ù. It isn't. But it is important that Remainers should try to make a better fist of the advantages of EU membership than they have managed so far. The impression given by the hard-core 'alt-right'is that we have been kicked around over the years by 'Brussels'ù. True, having failed to join what became the EU at the start, and having had two applications turned down, we were bound, as the latecomer, to start with a handicap. But the fact of the matter is that, over the years, successive prime ministers and chancellors have fought their corner, and nearly always contrived what are known these days as 'deals'in the national interest. Membership of the customs union and, later, the single market, proved a great boost to British industry and services, and attracted a lot of overseas investment, not least from Japanese companies. It is commonly acknowledged that these latter had a beneficent impact on British working practices and productivity. It was the realisation that continental Europe was outpacing the British economy that prompted the applications to join. Sure enough, for all the many problems and domestic economic policy mistakes, the British economy grew faster in the decades after entry than before. It was George Soros who said that, with our present arrangements with the rest of the EU, we have 'the best of both worlds'ù. We are not members of the eurozone, and are exempt from any obligation to participate in closer political union - although the fanatical Brexit brigade lie repeatedly about this. We did not have to join the European Monetary System in 1978-79 when we didn't want to, and we did not have to subscribe to any of the 1992 Maastricht treaty provisions of which we disapproved - such as the single currency. Many of these advantages are now threatened by the prospect of Brexit. We already knew of Nissan and Honda's concerns about being left out of the single market - in effect about Japanese companies being double-crossed by a Tory party that, under Thatcher, made the single market the lure for such investment. Now we have Elon Musk of Tesla, once seriously considering a new investment in the UK, opting instead for Berlin, on account of the uncertainty caused by Brexit. Musk is in the forefront of technology. So much for the attraction of global Britain! The absurdity of it all is well brought out in the November issue of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research's review. The NIESR estimates leaving the customs union and single market would leave the UK economy 3.5% smaller than under continued EU membership. This is generous! The government's own estimate, which for some reason ministers do not refer to, is of a 4.9% loss of GDP. Relative to EU membership, leaving the customs union and single market implies, according to the NIESR, that UK-EU goods trade would be 'lower by 40%, and UK-EU service trade '¶ lower by 60%'ù. This would be devastating, and not compensated for by the fantasy world of Singapore-style trade deals, which might take 10 years to negotiate. That is not all. During an election campaign in which both major parties are promising largesse on an unprecedented scale, the NIESR estimates that, as a result of Johnson's great 'deal'ù, 'government revenue would be lower by around 2.5% in the long run, or £26bn a year at 2016 prices'ù. They go on: 'The shortfall relative to a closer economic relationship with the EU would have to be met by raising tax rates, increased public borrowing or reduced public spending, or a combination of all these options.' Do disaffected voters who understandably used the referendum to protest against the impact of the banking crisis and subsequent austerity really want to compound the agony? I sincerely hope not. Now, I sympathise with the Lib Dems in wanting to revoke article 50, but I think it would be much better to tell those Brexiters who say 'the people have spoken'that, with a lot more knowledge about the implications, the people should be allowed to reflect and speak again. It is not the 2016 referendum that should be honoured, but the wellbeing and future of the nation.  ",0.125,Positive
"Dozens planned new centrist party after Brexit, says ex-Tory minister",0.375,Positive,"Advanced plans for another centrist political party to be launched after Brexit were developed by MPs earlier this year, it has emerged. Dozens of figures from inside and outside Westminster were involved in the project, designed to go public once a second Brexit referendum was no longer possible. Nick Boles, the former Conservative minister who quit the party over Brexit in April, said he had been 'constantly'in talks about a possible new party and had at one point been confident it would happen. An earlier failed attempt to launch a new party, Brexit delays and the tantalising prospect of a second referendum had stopped it. 'It's almost all I've been doing,'Boles said. 'I can't mention names, but it involved some very seriously good people, both MPs and not MPs, but people of great ability, experience and commitment. We had everything in a sense, except for the final resolve of a sufficient number of the individuals we needed in the Labour party. Without that, we were never going to get anywhere. 'If you'd asked me a few months ago, I would've been very optimistic that by now, something would've been up and running. Probably I deluded myself. Because I had made the break, and because I hadn't thought about it for a very long time and did it in stages, I somehow assumed that it was easier for others to take the same journey than it is. What I've realised is that it's a very difficult journey.'Boles, who is standing down as an MP at this election, said the project could only have succeeded if Brexit had been secured, allowing those wanting a soft Brexit and those wanting a second referendum to unite. 'We all thought that something new would only work and should only launch after this first phase of Brexit had been resolved,'he said. 'As soon as you're out of the EU, then we're all totally agreed - which is that we want the closest possible relationship with the EU. But the referendum idea came along and split us in two.'He said the failure of the party of 11 MPs launched in February, initially under the banner of The Independent Group (TIG), damaged public appetite for a new party. Initial success evaporated after the group changed its name and struggled with a lack of organisational strength. 'It was a jumping of the gun on a process that had begun but hadn't matured,'he said. 'Because TIG happened too soon and screwed it up, that gave those who were more nervous about the idea an excuse not to [split]. 'It's not impossible that Theresa May's Brexit deal could have got through parliament, maybe at the second time of asking. Then I think, a potential second attempt at creating something new might easily had happened, and might even have been more likely than not.'While it was not impossible such a force could happen from within parliament, Boles said it could actually emerge as a campaign outside Westminster. 'The question for people like me is, I guess, is that it?'he said. 'Throughout the process where I was having these conversations and planning meetings with various others mainly in the Labour party since I left, a number of people said to me, 'òNick, I admire what you're trying to do, I wish you all the success, but this is not how it is going to work'. It will work if it's a genuine, grassroots political movement that gathers force and takes parliament by storm - and erupts into an election cycle. 'It won't be something that is made up of a bunch of MPs elected for some other party and [who] for various reasons became disenchanted and created a liferaft to clamber aboard. I must say, while it's very hard for a movement of that kind to succeed, I sort of buy the argument that that is how it's got to happen.'",-0.25,Negative
Campaign genius Nigel Farage has totally self-partnered himself,1,Positive,"Things fall apart. The Brexit party's poll ratings are in freefall. The Bad Boys of Brexit have fallen out with each other. Arron Banks has gone cold on Nigel Farage. The money is drying up. And so are the crowds. Six months ago, Nigel could fill medium-sized arenas. Now the function room of the Hull Ionians rugby club in a small town outside Hull is way too big for him. Only 15 rows of chairs had been set out and two of them had to be removed shortly before the start. Not even a 1970s glitter ball hanging limply from the ceiling could help bring in the crowds. The dream is dying. As is Farage, from the inside out. After the warm-up acts of Hull's three Brexit party candidates - step forward Michelle Dewberry off The Apprentice - had failed to cut through the late-autumn chill, Channel 5 TV presenter and host for the day Dr David Bull summoned the star attraction. At the back of the room, Farage had looked stressed and tense as he waited to come on. But once his name was called, the smile was plastered on. Farage is an old pro at this, so he knows how to fake it to make it. But it's getting harder with every day. Unlike the other arrivistes, who have piggybacked on his notoriety as a career opportunity, Nigel has cared about this stuff for 25 years and now he can feel it turning to dust in his hands. Worst of all, he doesn't even know what to think or what to do right now. He thought he had managed to game the system only to discover that the system had his number all along. All he can do is plod on regardless, drifting ever closer to nothingness. 'Good morning, South Yorkshire,'he said, trying to sound enthusiastic. Not the best of starts when you happen to be in the East Riding. He then talked a bit about the floods. People had been let down and it was time to deal with the causes not the symptoms. For a moment it seemed as if Farage was making a late bid for the Green vote by talking about climate change. But no. All the flooding was apparently down to EU regulations. Brussels' revenge on the UK for voting for Brexit had been to flood large areas of Yorkshire. The smile dropped a little as he settled into his familiar routine. Making the same gags and running through the same patter of betrayal was becoming more painful by the day. Because the person who had done most to betray him was himself. Nigel had been undone by Nigel. Hubris, thy name is Nigel. The man who had time and again built himself up as the brilliant campaigner had turned out - yet again - to be fairly hopeless at running a general election campaign. He thought he had been calling the shots when he had offered the Tories an electoral pact. The Brexit party would stand aside in Tory-held constituencies, if the Conservatives gave him a clear shot at Labour seats. The Tories had said: 'Thanks, but no thanks.'So the tough negotiator had unilaterally gone ahead and agreed a deal that offered him nothing in return. He had made himself the Emma Watson of British politics. The party leader who had not only managed to self-partner himself but had also somehow contrived to cheat on himself. There's going to be an extremely messy break-up when Nigel finds out what Nigel has done to Nigel. The longer Farage spoke, the more you could feel the self-confidence drain away. Nothing made sense to him any more and he began to collapse inwards under the weight of his own contradictions. He was telling his supporters not to trust Boris when he had just done his best to make sure Johnson got re-elected as prime minister. Hell, every dummy knew Boris was a fraud but he had fallen for the most basic three-card con. He was telling them that everyone knew what they were voting for in the referendum - 'You did, didn't you?'- but had now discovered there were a variety of Brexits on offer. One of which he didn't want but had in effect endorsed anyway. He was telling them that the Conservatives were on course for an overall majority, so there was next to no point in them voting for the Brexit party in Labour seats because they would be screwed either way. It began to sound like a long political suicide note. An admission of futility. He could no longer maintain even the illusion that Brexit was within his hands. Within a week he had gone from leading actor to walk-on understudy. Twenty-five years of campaigning edging towards anonymity. Why was he even still here? The UK was dead to him. Two more weeks of this and he'd only be talking to his rapidly ageing reflection. Time to high-tail it back to the Donald and the US chatshow circuit. The future was bright, the future was orange. The audience shuffled nervously, as if intruding on a private grief. Normally, even a half-throttle Farage speech can generate a standing ovation. Now barely a quarter of the audience could be bothered to stand up and applaud. The rest contemplated the eternity of annihilation.

Rising proportion of EU citizens in UK given temporary 'pre-settled status',0.5,Positive,"The proportion of EU citizens being granted a temporary, more precarious 'pre-settled status'in the UK has continued to rise, the latest Home Office statistics show, and the backlog of unresolved cases has grown to more than half a million, causing unease among campaign groups that support EU nationals living in Britain. Most of the estimated 3.4 million EU citizens resident in the UK must apply for settled status if they want to continue living here legally after Brexit. The latest EU settlement scheme statistics show that 590,300 people applied for settled status in October, bringing the total number of applications to 2,450,000. Just over 1.9 million people have been granted some form of status in the UK. However, the proportion of people being allocated the more precarious, temporary pre-settled status continues to rise, jumping from 32% in the testing phase of the scheme to 34% in the month after the national launch in March, and up to 44% of all applications processed in October. EU campaigners said it was positive to see more than half a million people applying for the status for the second month running, but expressed concern at the rise in the number of applications which have not yet been approved, with a backlog now of more than 525,200. Nicolas Hatton, a co-founder of the EU citizens' campaign group the3million, said it was hard to understand exactly why the backlog was growing. 'We don't know the reason. They may have processed the easier cases at the beginning, and the more difficult ones are creating a backlog. But more people are waiting now,'he said. The group described the rise in the proportion of applicants getting the 'inferior pre-settled status'ù, which represents a limited leave to remain in the UK, as a worrying trend. Although many applicants will have been correctly granted this status because they have not yet been in the country for five years, some are accepting this outcome because they have struggled to provide evidence that they have already lived here for that period. People who are granted pre-settled status will have to reapply for the full, permanent settled status once they are able to provide evidence that they have lived continuously in the UK for five years. Elena Remigi, the founder and director of the In Limbo project, which represents EU citizens, said: 'The statistics show a growing number of people applying for the settlement scheme, but we've also noticed an equally growing number of people waiting for several weeks, if not months, before receiving a reply. The elderly in particular seem to be the ones struggling with this scheme and many are told to provide further evidence. Many are receiving pre- rather than full settled status.'Stephanie Dawoud, of the immigration organisation IMIX, said: 'While the Home Office is doing comparatively well in terms of processing the number of applications, we still don't have any robust numbers of EU citizens and their family members in the UK, which the statistics can be measured against.'The Home Office said EU citizens and their families have until 31 December 2020 to apply, and added that applicants can apply for an administrative review if they think they were wrongly granted pre-settled status.

The Lib Dems hate Labour more than they hate Brexit,-0.5,Negative,"The Tory electoral strategy is straightforward: unite leave voters behind the Conservative banner. Nigel Farage's decision to form a de facto pact with the Tories should serve as a moment of clarity. The differences between Farage and Boris Johnson, Donald Trump's two principal British allies, are merely personal: politically, they are on the same page. Both fundamentally see Brexit as a blunt instrument to reshape British society, stripping away the pesky workers' rights and consumer and social protections that stand in the way of their hyper-Thatcherite dystopia. John Major once declared that the NHS was as safe with Johnson and Michael Gove 'as a pet hamster would be with a hungry python'ù; Farage is on record supporting its privatisation. This pact should be treated as a national political emergency: in four weeks, it may triumph and transform Britain for a generation. The second plank of the Tory strategy relies on the Liberal Democrats dividing the remain vote. Jo Swinson may have valid reasons, on her own political terms, for waging her party's rampantly anti-Labour campaign. The Lib Dems' only real chance of picking up significant numbers of seats is in the south-west, and that means winning over Tory remainers who abhor the very notion of a Corbyn-led government. By focusing her attacks on Labour rather than the Tory Brexiteers, Swinson believes she will reassure those David Cameron-type supporters that a vote for the Lib Dems will not install Corbyn in Downing Street. It is why Swinson so aggressively opposed a temporary Corbyn premiership to extend article 50 and call an election, and why she refuses to stand down candidates against anti-Brexit Labour MPs. The problem is that the future of the country is rather more important than whether the Lib Dems win back St Ives, Cheltenham or North Devon. Canterbury was a Tory fortress from the mid-19th century until Labour's Rosie Duffield triumphed in 2017 with a majority of just 187 votes. The Lib Dems' Tim Walker stood down for the principled, commonsense reason that if he succeeded in dividing the anti-Tory vote, the hard Brexit Tory candidate - a Vote Leave veteran - would take the seat instead. The Lib Dem leadership's response? Disciplining Walker and imposing a new candidate instead. That led a Lib Dem candidate, Guy Kiddey, in the marginal of High Peak - held by Labour with a majority of 2,322 - to threaten to resign from the party. He was later told he would be replaced as the Lib Dem candidate. The Lib Dems will protest that this is terribly unfair. Are they not a national party with the right to stand wherever they choose? Yes, this is how politics works. But the problem is this: the party has made stopping Brexit its defining cause, while simultaneously portraying it as a crusade that transcends party politics. The Lib Dems know that throwing resources at seats they cannot win and peeling away significant numbers of Labour voters will allow the Tories to win. They know that demonising Labour as a 'Brexit party'- when a Labour-led government implementing its policy of a second referendum is the only plausible route to stop Brexit - divides remainers to the benefit of the Tory Brexiteers. They know that focusing their vitriol on Corbyn strengthens the position of Johnson. But ultimately they are not, by definition, an anti-Brexit party; the remain cause is secondary to increasing the number of Lib Dem seats in parliament. If your main aim in politics is to advance the partisan interests of the Lib Dems and repeat their performance in government, then this makes sense. If your only cause is stopping Brexit, however, it does not. There will be some who vote Lib Dem in four weeks' time because of dishonest graphs printed on leaflets claiming that only Swinson's party can defeat Johnson in tight Tory-Labour marginals. If they wake up to see a beaming Boris Johnson, relishing his newly minted Tory majority and pledging to implement a Trumpian hard Brexit by the end of January, they will feel horrified and tricked.  That does not absolve Labour of its responsibilities. No party has a divine right to any voters. In 19 November's televised debate with Johnson, Corbyn must surely make it clear to disillusioned remainers that Labour's referendum policy is their only chance of stopping Johnson's Brexit. This doesn't mean a return to the cynical 'you might hate us but the Tories are worse'politics of the New Labour years - in fact, the party's commitments to hiking tax on the top 5% to invest in public services, public ownership and scrapping tuition fees are very popular. A tightrope has to be trodden, of course: Labour supporters who voted for Brexit, particularly in leave-leaning northern constituencies, cannot simply be ignored. The party's challenges go beyond Brexit. A new poll from Survation finds that just 45% of 18- to 34-year-olds and less than half of those earning under £20,000 are certain to vote, compared with 81.5% of over 65-year-olds and 77% of those earning more than £40,000. It is these people - who should be natural Labour voters - that the party urgently needs to get out. Labour's best hope is to mobilise its key strength - its mass membership - and focus on its popular domestic policies and a positive vision. That does not mean avoiding the obvious truth, however, which is that the Tory Brexiteers' best hopes rely on the Lib Dems. If a Tory hard Brexit is unleashed in the coming weeks, then Jo Swinson and her cynical Lib Dem strategists will rank among its chief handmaidens.

Ex-Tory cabinet minister David Gauke to run as independent,0.125,Positive,"The former Tory cabinet minister David Gauke has announced he will stand as an independent candidate at the general election. The former justice secretary said he would contest the South West Hertfordshire seat he has held since 2005. Gauke also endorsed calls for a second referendum, saying there was no longer any chance of uniting the country around a 'relatively soft Brexit'ù. He told the Times: 'I represent a form of liberal Conservatism, but the last few months have been increasingly uncomfortable... The principle issue of this general election is Brexit and I think that the Conservative party has got it badly wrong. 'The easy thing to do would be to go quietly but I feel that I have to make a stand and make the case that we are heading towards an outcome that we will deeply regret.'Gauke was one of 21 MPs kicked out of the Tory party in September after they backed a plan to take control of the Commons timetable to pass legislation to block a no-deal Brexit. He did not have the whip restored and speculation over whether he would stand as an independent candidate in his seat has been rife. His decision, coupled with his backing of a second referendum, will put pressure on the Liberal Democrats to stand their candidate down in the constituency. The party's candidate in Marlow, Buckinghamshire has stood aside to make room for another ex-Tory, Dominic Grieve, to stand. Like Gauke, the former attorney general was one of the 21 MPs expelled in September. ",-0.125,Negative
Alexander Downer says Australia should reduce UK intelligence sharing if Corbyn wins,0.75,Positive,"Australia's former top diplomat in the United Kingdom, Alexander Downer, has intervened in the British election contest, declaring the Morrison government would need to 'substantially reduce'intelligence sharing with London in the event Jeremy Corbyn wins on 12 December. In an excoriating assessment of the Labour leader at the National Press Club in Canberra, Downer contended that a Corbyn victory would imperil substantial Australian investments in Britain, and would trigger a reassessment of the 'very intimate'security relationship between Canberra and London. Downer is a former leader of the Liberal party in Australia, and was foreign affairs minister in the Howard government for more than a decade. He was appointed after his retirement from politics as high commissioner in London by the Liberal government in Canberra. Downer on Tuesday rated Boris Johnson's prospect of victory at about 70%, but he warned if the Conservatives failed to win outright 'then expect Jeremy Corbyn to be the prime minister'ù. Downer said the result mattered to Australia because the UK was the second-largest offshore destination for Australian investment. 'If the Corbyn government comes in with its extremely radical economic agenda, a kind of Venezuelan-style, Maduro-style economic agenda, very South American economic agenda, and unfamiliar to any of us here in Australia - I think you would expect a very substantial deterioration in the British economy, and as a result of that, that would put at risk the investments we have '¶ made in the UK,'Downer said. In relation to national security, he said the election of the leftwing Labour leader would disrupt the 'very intimate and important relationship'between Asis, MI6, Asio, GCHQ and the Australian Signal Directorate. 'Great Britain is the second-most important country in security terms in the western alliance'ù. 'Under a Corbyn government, they will abandon the support for the western alliance and steer a completely different foreign policy and security policy direction to such an extent that I think we would be unwise to continue the intelligence-sharing relationship with a Corbyn-led Britain of the kind that we've had '¶ under Gordon Brown and Tony Blair and so on over the years. 'I think that would have to change. So I'm hoping, unusually '¶ you will be surprised to hear me say this, that Boris Johnson wins the election on the 12th of December. I think it is important to us as Australians.'Pressed to clarify his undiplomatic intervention on security sharing, Downer doubled down on Tuesday, saying: 'I think we would substantially reduce it, substantially wind it back. 'We would have to be very careful because of the foreign policy stance of Jeremy Corbyn and the cohorts around him. These are people who are unsympathetic to and hostile to western interests, they have engaged as friends and allies of people like Hamas and Hezbollah, the Iranians, the Venezuelans and so on. 'These are people who are totally hostile to the traditions of western security policy. The leadership of the British Labour party is something we have never seen in a major political party in this country. These are people way over to the very, very far left, and it would change the whole nature of our engagement with the UK if Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister. Comment has been sought from Australia's foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne. Downer's appearance at Canberra's National Press Club on Tuesday was billed as a situation report on Brexit, but the former diplomat and foreign affairs minister faced sustained questioning about his participation in the Barr inquiry in the United States. Donald Trump has established the Barr inquiry to discredit the Mueller investigation. The Mueller investigation began after Downer was allegedly told by George Papadopoulos, then a Trump campaign aide, that Russia had obtained damaging information about Hillary Clinton from her emails. Downer then informed US authorities, which has led to accusations from Trump allies, such as the Senate judiciary committee chairman, Lindsey Graham, about the then high commissioner's 'directed'role in relaying information to US authorities about the Clinton emails. Australia has rejected those accusations. Downer refused to give direct answers to questions about the level of his participation in the Barr inquiry, or whether he now regretted his conversation in a London wine bar with Papadopoulos. He said he did not want to 'play into the toxic politics of America'or disrupt the orderly business of the inquiry by providing commentary, although he signalled without saying so directly that he had been interviewed, and was 'fully cooperating with the Australian government'ù. Downer declined to answer a question about whether he had sought permission from Canberra before he relayed the insights from Papadopoulos to the American chargÈ d'affaires in London in July 2016. Guardian Australia revealed at the start of October that Downer had taken the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and senior colleagues by surprise when he shared politically sensitive information with his American counterpart in London. Downer has not previously contested that version of events, and didn't when asked if he wanted to set the record straight on Tuesday. 'I'm not sure why you bother with it, I'm not sure why you care. I don't want to set the record straight, I don't care what people are saying,'he said. 'I retired from politics long ago, you can say what you like'ù. ",-0.125,Negative
"David Cameron thinks he is born to rule, says John Bercow",0.25,Positive,"The former Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has stoked his longstanding feud with David Cameron, saying the former Tory prime minister feels he is 'born to rule'and has a 'probably public-school-instilled'sense of his own superiority. In an exclusive interview with the Observer that will be published on Sunday morning, Bercow also suggests Cameron called the 2016 Brexit referendum for selfish political reasons, rather than because there was a strong clamour for a public vote on leaving the EU from the British people. Asked about his relationships with Eton-educated Cameron and Boris Johnson, Bercow, who attended a comprehensive school in north London, says that he gets on well with the current prime minister, but is less keen on Johnson's predecessor but one. Bercow says that Cameron 'could be very impressive'on big occasions but adds: 'David is relentlessly tactical rather than strategic. Let's face it, he chose to call the referendum. Was there a clamour for it? There was not. There was chuntering in his own party, but the public wasn't demanding one. He just thought it would work for him.'He has the most enormous, probably public-school-instilled, self-confidence. He thinks people like him are born to rule, that the natural order is that people like him run things, and that he is in a superior position.'Bercow, formerly the Conservative MP for Buckingham, stood down after 10 years as Speaker at the end of last month. He will be succeeded by Labour's Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who won the election to replace him last week. Asked how he was intending to vote at the 12 December general election, Bercow refused to say, suggesting he may not choose the Tories. 'You can ask me, but I'm not going to tell you,'he says. Bercow's tenure as Speaker was frequently controversial: many Conservative MPs and ministers believed that he was biased against the Tory side and became increasingly and transparently supportive of MPs who backed remaining in the European Union. On Brexit, Bercow says the decision to leave the EU is the biggest foreign policy mistake by a British government in the postwar period. He also criticises Brexiters for campaigning to leave the EU before they had devised a detailed plan about how a UK withdrawal could be achieved, and would work. This lack of forethought by Brexiters meant the last three years of his time as Speaker were dominated by rows in parliament between Remainers and Leavers, leading in the end to total deadlock. 'I had assumed that the architects of, and proselytisers for, Brexit, would have a clear idea of what they wanted. I was surprised there wasn't greater clarity,'he says. ",-0.125,Negative
Can Britain reach a trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020?,0.25,Positive,"Britain's journey beyond a potential exit from the EU will be fraught, complicated and full of political potholes. Labour wants Brexit sorted, the Liberal Democrats want Brexit stopped and the Conservatives want Brexit done and a free-trade agreement signed by 31 December 2020, the end of the transition period. Time to negotiate a future trading relationship with the EU has already been reduced from two years to 11 months and few experts believe it is possible to 'get Brexit done'in that time, raising the possibility of crashing out on 31 December 2020. After the general election, the first thing on the new PM's in-tray will be to ratify or, if it is Labour, to renegotiate the Brexit deal. If it is Boris Johnson, he will have until 31 January to do so, or risk asking for a further extension. Even that deadline is a challenge. Approval for the Brexit deal comes with the passing of the withdrawal agreement bill (WAB). Theresa May's version took 11 months to conclude. Johnson argues that much of his deal is in fact based on May's and therefore it is possible to get it passed in a number of weeks. Johnson's director of legislative affairs, Nikki da Costa, has previously said the WAB could take 37 days to get through parliament: 13 days in the Commons, close to 20 in the Lords and four in the so-called 'ping pong'stage when final wording is agreed. This will be the first flash point in 2020. Will the Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU) be mothballed? Will the Department for International Trade lead the talks? Or will Downing Street decide, as it did under May and Johnson, to keep a tight rein on negotiations? 'I think there is going to be a turf war. A lot may also hinge on what happens to DExEU but, in particular, what sort of No 10 Boris Johnson, if he is prime minister, wants to run. The Foreign Office will also want to reassert itself after a few bruising years and the Treasury will want to have a say about what is in [the negotiating objectives] and what's not,'said Adam Terry, the practice lead on financial services at consultancy Global Counsel. Talks cannot legally start until the withdrawal agreement is approved. Most are assuming the earliest this could happen is 1 February. Once the withdrawal agreement is ratified, the UK can open talks with the EU and other countries. However, it cannot implement a deal with a non-EU country until after Britain has left the bloc. Why is a barrier in the Irish Sea being discussed? In agreeing a deal to guarantee the Irish border remains invisible, with no checks fuelling inter-community tensions, the UK is moving the border to the Irish Sea. If all goods entering the island of Ireland are checked before arrival for standards and tariffs, then cross-border trade can continue to flow unimpeded. It will also protect the single market and reduce the chance of suspect goods making their way to the continent via Northern Ireland and the republic. How much trade goes from Great Britain to Northern Ireland? Around 450,000 trailers arrive in Northern Ireland every year, transporting everything from cars to soft cheese to school shirts. Trade and services purchased from Great Britain were valued at £13.4bn according to the latest data, £11bn of that representing goods. About 70% of goods purchased by Northern Irish businesses from Great Britain are destined for the high street and are largely food to Tesco, Sainsbury's and other supermarkets, clothing and white goods, cars and motorbikes. Who will the new Brexit terms impact? All companies moving goods to Northern Ireland. Business representatives believe the big companies such as supermarket chains will be able to put systems in place to deal with any checks but will be looking for government assistance to help smaller businesses. The extent and type of checks will not be clear until the detail of the deal emerges, but essentially they fall into two categories: tariffs and VAT. Excise duties also apply but will not trouble most importers as they generally apply to a limited amount of controlled goods including alcohol, cigarettes and fuel. Customs declarations apply for both exports and imports and, although the trade is domestic, for the purposes of this version of a Brexit backstop, the checks will be made on behalf of the EU. It is concerned about goods from a third country leaking into Ireland and therefore the single market. Will there be a border through the Irish Sea immediately if parliament votes for a deal? No. The discussion over the Irish border is part of Boris Johnson's alternative arrangements to the controversial backstop. It will only be triggered if the UK and EU do not seal their main trade deal before the end of the transition period. Lisa O'Carroll†Brexit correspondent Under the deal struck by May and followed by Johnson, the UK has until the end of December 2020 to conclude its future relationship negotiations. This leaves the government with just 11 months to conclude not just a free-trade deal, but a deal on security and what are known as 'cross-cutting'activities, issues that cross many divides such as science, education and international development. Yes. He says if he wins the election, he will complete a free-trade deal by 31 December next year 'î in other words within 11 months. Few experts say this is attainable. 'There is a very strong argument that it will not be possible to complete everything necessary to leave with a deal - negotiations and sorting the practicalities - in 11 months,'says Joe Owen, the director of the Brexit programme at the Institute for Government. The UK has an option, agreed under May's deal, to extend the transition period for one or two years. This would be a one-off request and has to be made by 1 July. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, has said a Conservative government would not ask for a transition extension. Catherine Barnard, a professor of EU law at the University of Cambridge, told the Brexit select committee last week that the 'average period of time for negotiating a trade agreement is 48 months'ù, with the additional complication that 'never before have you had an agreement diverging rather than converging'ù. Crash out without a deal on 31 December 2020 and default to World Trade Organization rules, with tariffs on goods coming into the UK. Eurosceptics favour this. Negotiate a bare bones free-trade deal and outline agreement on the rest. Follow May's and Philip Hammond's way of thinking and decide a comprehensive and close alignment with the EU is in the best interests of the country. This would almost certainly involve an extension to the transition period of up to two years. Trade talks conventionally involve both sides drawing up their wish lists, their must-haves and their red lines. The US has already published its negotiation objectives for a trade deal with the UK after consultation with its trade bodies. The European commission will get its mandate after the next meeting of EU leaders in December. The UK, meanwhile, has not yet agreed on its mandate, never mind published its objectives. The closer the EU and the UK are, the greater the demands by the EU for Britain to maintain standards, or a level playing field, on food, workers' rights and other key issues. This is aimed at ensuring it does not become a 'Singapore-on-Thames'ù, able to undercut the bloc with a low-tax, cheap labour economy. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has already warned that consequences will flow from a WTO-style arrangement, saying the British government would face a 'proportional'response if it sought to roll back core social, environmental and consumer standards. The next phase of Brexit is characterised as talks on trade. It is not. It is about the entire relationship covering political, cultural and security arrangements. Owen says one option for the government is to pursue three parallel agreements covering trade and data: security and cross-cutting activities that transect Whitehall and societal divides such as science, education and international development. Barnard echoes this, noting the reference in Johnson's Brexit deal is to 'agreements plural'ù. This raises questions over whether the negotiations could be staggered over time, with a bare bones trade deal covering tariffs struck by the end of 2020, and other outline agreements to progress in other areas in the months and years to come, she says. The 'easiest'deal would be on goods under article 207 of the EU treaty on free-trade deals, which would cover a tariff arrangement on goods alone. 'It is in the interest of the EU to do a trade deal quickly because it has a surplus with the UK,'said Barnard. If Labour takes power, they will seek a closer alignment with the EU and then put it back to the electorate in a referendum, asking voters to choose between its deal and remain. This guarantees an extension to the transition period as renegotiation and referendum planning would take an estimated six months. Yes. Politics is one of three important Brexit threads. The other two being legislation and behind-the-scenes planning in Whitehall. However, as Owen points out, it will be a mammoth task to get just the arrangements for Northern Ireland - the IT systems, new staff and business readiness - up and running within 11 months. HMRC will have to start work immediately on putting a new border in the Irish sea with next to no groundwork done in the last three years. Owen points out that businesses were given 14 months to become familiar with a new HMRC system in 2011, yet the Brexit deal calls for a new system to be designed, developed and implemented successfully within 11 months - a Herculean, if not impossible, task. A huge legislative programme on laws such as immigration will accompany Brexit raising the potential of parliament being gridlocked again over Brexit. No-deal planning will have to continue until the decision is known on the transition period extension, presenting a challenge for Gove, who may have ambitions for a leading role in negotiations.

The Observer view on the risk the Tory party poses to the NHS,-0.625,Negative,"It is little wonder that the NHS takes centre stage in election campaign after election campaign: it commands an extraordinary level of public support. We are more proud of the NHS than the armed forces or the royal family. Nine in 10 support the founding principles of the NHS: free to all on the basis of need, not ability to pay. And if the NHS is the closest thing the British have to a religion, voters tend to look unfavourably on politicians seen to embody a credible threat to it. This is why Jeremy Corbyn launched his campaign with a stark warning about the threat of a US trade deal struck by a Conservative government, declaring the NHS is 'not for sale'ù. The Conservatives promptly hit back; the health secretary, Matt Hancock, called it one of Labour's 'pathetic scare stories'ù. Even Donald Trump weighed in, saying: 'It's not for us to have anything to do with your healthcare system'¶ we're just talking about trade.'It would be politically foolish for any Conservative government to try to unpick the fundamental underpinnings of the NHS; to pave the way for large-scale privatisation, to introduce an insurance-style system or to bring in significant user charges. But Labour is right that the Conservatives pose a more insidious threat, by starving it of the resources it needs, and introducing the means for powerful private-sector suppliers, such as the big pharma companies, to extract more profit at the expense of the taxpayer. The Conservative record since 2010 speaks for itself. Like every other public service, the NHS has come under severe strain as a result of public spending cuts imposed by Tory chancellors, even as they have doled out generous tax cuts costing billions of pounds a year that have disproportionately benefited more affluent families. This last decade has represented the tightest funding settlement the NHS has received since its founding. Funding has not kept pace with rising demand as a result of an ageing population and advances in medical technology, despite the fact that spending on healthcare is significantly lower than among many of our international competitors. The verdict of the independent King's Fund is that the NHS is 'clearly under-resourced'ù. This is why, winter after winter, the NHS has struggled to meet need. Last winter, it took the unprecedented step of cancelling all non-urgent surgery, against a backdrop of increasing waiting lists, understaffing and bed occupancy rates consistently above the levels that permit safe care. Meanwhile, Conservative ministers have sought to misrepresent the figures: they have consistently claimed that the NHS is getting more money than it actually is. So the Conservatives have already put the NHS at risk in order to fulfil their objective of cutting back public spending in order to pay for expensive and unnecessary tax cuts. There is no reason to believe they will not do so again. A US trade deal is a cherished objective of the hard Eurosceptic right that now dominates the Conservative party and it poses serious risks to the NHS. It could open the door to rising NHS drug costs to the tune of billions of pounds a year. The NHS is one of the world's biggest drugs purchasers and exerts a significant downward pressure on prices. Most pharmaceutical companies take part in a voluntary pricing and access scheme that caps the total price the NHS pays for drugs manufactured under patent. The NHS also has a world-leading system for assessing drugs, not just for safety and effectiveness but value for money. Together, these mechanisms mean pharmaceutical companies wanting to sell to the NHS have to offer their drugs many times cheaper than in the under-regulated American market. The price the NHS pays influences pricing across much of the rest of the world. The US pharmaceutical industry has thus long had the NHS in its sights and in Trump they have found a sympathetic ear. He has taken aim at 'freeloading'foreign countries that regulate drug prices, blaming them for high US prices. The US government's desire to liberalise access to international drug markets has shaped the trade deals it has struck with other countries and it has stated it is an objective in any trade talks with the UK. As revealed by Channel 4's Dispatches last week, it has already been the subject of several meetings between US and UK trade negotiators. The hardline Tory right is desperate for a US trade deal that would align the UK's regulatory standards more closely to that of the free-market US; it is one of the reasons why it has always wanted to leave the EU. And the US is an economic powerhouse that will expect most of its objectives to be met in such a deal, particularly under an America-first president. After the economic fallout of a Boris Johnson hard Brexit, the UK would hardly be in a place to make exacting demands. A Johnson government could sign up the UK to measures in an international treaty that would bind the hand of future governments and turn Britain into a true rule-taker from the US. It makes an ultimate irony of the argument advanced by Brexiters that we should leave the EU, an institution over whose laws and rules we have a democratic say, in order to 'take back control'ù. The ideological right has taken over the Conservative party. It has already shown through its determination to pursue a hard Brexit that it will sacrifice the country's economic wellbeing in order to get the version of the future it wants. Think it will exclude the NHS? Think again. The old adage has perhaps never been more right. You can't trust the Tories with the NHS. ",0.75,Positive
Woodford fallout: full transparency for fund managers is a must,0.125,Positive,"One minor consolation for investors in Neil Woodford's funds is that the fallen manager shares their pain. After all, didn't he say on many occasions, from launch in 2014 to suspension of the flagship Equity Income fund in June, that 'all my personal financial investments are in funds we run here'ù? Yes, he did. So how much did Woodford invest? And, given that his jointly-owned management company received roughly £100m over the years, did he direct his slice of the dividends into his funds? And what is a 'financial investment'anyway? The term would normally be taken to exclude cash and property. Is it possible that Woodford could have sold units in order to buy, say, a house or a farm or to place cash on deposit? If he had done so, he would still be able to say 100% of his 'financial investments'were in his funds. There is, to be clear, no suggestion that Woodford reduced his personal exposure to his misfiring funds at any time. The only exception is the personal sale that was disclosed - the disposal in July this year of £1m of shares in the quoted Patient Capital investment trust. The point is that formal disclosure requirements for fund managers, not just Woodford, are minimal - and almost non-existent for unit trusts such as Woodford's Equity Income and Income Focus funds. There is a rule that promotional messages, such as boasts about having 'skin in the game'ù, must be 'clear, fair and not misleading.'And there is a duty on firms to manage conflicts of interest. But that's about it. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) confirms: there is 'no requirement'on fund managers to disclose how much of their own money they have invested in a fund they manage. This situation looks unsustainable. All directors of public companies must promptly declare holdings and dealings in their employer. So why not fund managers with their funds? Over in the US, they've had full disclosure since 2004 and the system is surely cleaner. 'It is disappointing that the regulator doesn't require transparency for manager or board ownership of funds in the UK,'says Christopher Traulsen, director at research ratings firm Morningstar. Absolutely right. To repeat, it's probable that Woodford still holds all his investments in his funds (aside from the £1m of Patient Capital shares) and suffered the full blast of under-performance. But we shouldn't have to assume that's the case. The FCA needs to address this issue. Investors expect transparency - rather than assurances that can't be checked. Royal Mail's management is understandably desperate to avoid a pre-Christmas strike, as currently threatened by the Communication Workers Union, whose members voted a fortnight ago for industrial action by a majority of 97%. The company offered on Tuesday to 'enter into discussions without preconditions'if the union rules out action until the end of the year. Come back on Wednesday to hear the union's definitive response, but an outbreak of harmony is not the way to bet. Royal Mail's announcement was 'a total sham designed to undermine the CWU and any prospect of an agreement,'said deputy general secretary Terry Pullinger. The stakes are high in this dispute over pay, pensions, working hours and productivity. A national strike would be the first for a decade at Royal Mail and the likely date of late-November is alarming the City. It would hit Black Friday online shopping orders, which are a nice earner for the parcels side of the business. A strike that also falls in the latter stages of a general election campaign would add another twist. The dispute would inevitably risk becoming more politicised, not least because of Labour's nationalisation plans for the Royal Mail. The shares shed 5% on Tuesday, the biggest fall in the FTSE 250 index. One can understand why. A tragedy for collectors: the commemorative 50p coins produced to mark the UK's (non) departure from the European Union on 31 October are to be melted down and 'recycled'ù. Huge mark-ups on face value were being talked about. Instead, rarity value is being thrown in the smelter. Mind you, the Treasury's claim that there's no cost to the taxpayer also deserves to be binned. Yes, the costs of producing commemorative coins, as opposed to coins for circulation, are met by the Royal Mint and not the Treasury. But the Royal Mint is 100% owned by the state and, since recycling coins is presumably not costless, there is an indirect hit to taxpayers. It's one of the smaller Brexit deceits - but the Treasury ought to know what it, and we, own. ",-0.625,Negative
"Even if the Tories win an election, Brexit will finish them",0.125,Positive,"Stop all those clocks in Downing Street, counting down to the Halloween Brexit. Stop Operation Yellowhammer: cancel emergency medicine stockpiling, ferries, warehouses and freezers. Stop this morning's Operation Brock, diverting HGVs on the M20. Melt down those shamelessly triumphal commemorative 50p coins, and halt the £100m splashed on 'Get ready for Brexit'information. Gross maladministration must surely be the National Audit Office verdict, when the day comes to tally the cost, along with those hundreds of thousands of wasted civil-servant hours on the Brexits that never were. Boris Johnson may not be dead in a ditch - just sunk into the Theresa May memorial Brexit quicksands. The more he thrashes around the deeper he sinks, quixotically abandoning his withdrawal agreement bill just as it won a 30-vote majority. No wonder he dare not give MPs time to scrutinise its 1,000 pages of notes for more than three perfunctory days: many were ready with Philip Hammond to append a customs union, and a confirmatory referendum was still on the cards. The more MPs look, the worse Johnson's Brexit seems, with ministers seizing arbitrary control of vital issues that should be subject to parliamentary votes while European Union working and environmental rights are removed. No wonder Johnson has three times cancelled his appearance before the powerful liaison committee. No wonder he dare not hold a budget, with the Office for Budget Responsibility due to issue grim assessments on the economy and future growth. Instead he tried for an election to blame all Brexit pandemonium on parliament. Labour abstaining tonight is temporary. Whether by Lib Dem and SNP bill, a one-line government bill or Jeremy Corbyn moving a vote of no confidence, an election is imminent, as Labour's shadow cabinet agreed today - even if it is delayed until after Christmas. Pollsters and psephologists judge this as the most wildly unpredictable election in modern memory. Almost anything could happen. Snapshot polls are no longer good forecasts when the electorate is more volatile than ever, says the British Election Study. Professor Rob Ford calls this 'the biggest gamble in modern political history'ù, with recent polls showing the Tories anywhere between 3% and 16% ahead. Remain and leave poll as stronger identities than party allegiance, but no one knows how that translates to seats on election day. Most in Labour are well aware of the perils, their leader unpopular with every age and class. The shadow cabinet were shocked to be told that no one knew how many key seats still have no candidate while Karie Murphy, ejected from Corbyn's office to improbably run a campaign for the first time, left staff dumbstruck at her plan to have no target seats, but instead to fight everywhere equally. Yet don't imagine calm in the Tory camp, riven between wild man Dominic Cummings and more sober advisers. Their own reports are not good from those northern and Midlands leaver seats they want to snatch from Labour. Nor is their leader such a bonus. Sky Data polling shows Johnson's personal rating is -3, lower for a leader in their first three months than any of the last five prime ministers. True, that looks dandy compared with Corbyn's -55 rating, but there is no bouncing Boris-mania. A confected 'people versus parliament'Tory campaign will not survive its first encounter with the enemy. As Johnson meets real voters, wait for the nurse to speak up, or the teacher, the charity worker for rough sleepers or the bus driver on one of the rural routes cut by 40%. The prime minister may meet an environmental health officer no longer regularly inspecting restaurants, or the keeper fired from tending the local park. Ordinary people, wherever Johnson goes, have nine years' worth of cuts to scold him with, and will tell his accompanying cameras. When Tory politicians on walkabouts promise millions and billions to repair all this, why would they be believed? They cancelled their own budget so no one knows their fiscal plans. Nowhere is safe turf for them; there are angry denizens of Surrey too. Labour's manifesto is already popular - from nationalising trains and utilities, to its investment in Green New Deal. Things happen in elections to spoil a government's careful election grid, making this lot vulnerable on many fronts. Boris Johnson is a host of accidents waiting to happen, and so are many of his cabinet zealots. Dominic Raab, Priti Patel, Liz Truss, Esther McVey, Sajid Javid, Andrea Leadsom, to name just a few, are walking liabilities who think and often say memorably voter-repellent things. Five weeks can feel a long time under the scrutiny they have avoided so far. In a four-party contest, where small voting shifts can cascade into unlikely shock results, a hung parliament is well within reach. This anything-is-possible election could break either of the old parties. Labour could implode, losing a devastating landslide of seats, with the Lib Dems riding the remainer rocket. Consider this: if the Tories win, their Brexit deal will be theirs to administer. They who infected the country with the Brexit disease over the decades will now own it, not just for the next five years of miserable consequences but for ever, with no one else to blame. Already demography is destiny and year by year the average age of Tory voters grows higher, with 30-year-olds twice as likely to vote Labour. Brexit and its aftermath might finish the Tories off, for their historic crime of leading the country astray with lies and false visions. In their victory may be their demise. ",-0.625,Negative
The housing crisis is at the heart of our national nervous breakdown,-0.125,Negative,"Over the past three years, commentary about the nervous, uncertain condition of Britain has repeatedly veered into questions of 'belonging'and community. These things tend to be framed in terms of culture: conversations about whether liberals and leftwingers can speak to people attached to nation and place, angst about flags, understandable fears about the point at which such things blur into nastiness and bigotry. In the process, one crucial point is rather missed. If you are going to talk about whether people feel rooted, and the absolute basics of community, there is one subject that ought to command your attention: that of the basic, primal idea of home, and the fact that far too many people in this country either do not have one, or worry that the one they possess might be about to get snatched away. It is, in other words, time we talked about our national predicament - and indeed, what might be at stake in the election, whenever it arrives - by acknowledging that housing is a central issue, and always has been. The nitty-gritty of politics is often reduced to the cliche of 'schools and hospitals'ù. But think of the aftermath of each world war, and the great steps forward marked by the concerted building of council houses. Or the way that, post-1979, Thatcherism became hegemonic via the right-to-buy scheme, and the sale of many of those same homes to their occupiers - and then in turn to private landlords, a fact that defines a lot of the dysfunction of modern Britain. And let's not forget: it was housing that tipped the world into the crash of 2008, when the banks finally confronted the lunacy of sub-prime mortgages, essentially a replacement for the public housing the US - and the UK - had forgotten how to build. When I try to get a sense of the anxieties and fears that sit under Brexit by talking to people who voted to leave, it doesn't take long for this subject to come up. The standard concern will be something like, 'I just worry my kids won't have anywhere to live'- whereupon the conversation will tumble into predictable complaints and fears. According to research commissioned by the National Housing Federation (which represents housing associations), 3.6 million people in England are living in an overcrowded home, 2.5 million are unable to afford their rent or mortgage, and another 2.5 million are in 'hidden households'they can't move out of - including house-shares, adults living with their parents, or people living with an ex. Rates of home ownership among the under-35s are at less than half the levels of 20 years ago. Homelessness, both visible and hidden, has become a grimly mundane part of life. A million families are stuck on council waiting lists; in 2017-18, a pitiful 6,463 units of social housing were built in England, down from 30,000 a decade before. If you hear the phrase 'new housing'ù, what comes to mind? In our big cities, it will probably be high-end, supposedly 'luxury'apartments, marketed via a dream of glamour and ease, and usually devoid of any realistically affordable element. A perfect case in point is Manchester, where the city council talks up its plans for new housing in 'affordability zones'ù, but controversy about the arrival of opulent residential developments in the city centre is reaching a peak. Last week, one of the leading architects involved baldly claimed that 'there aren't enough expensive homes in the city'ù; most Mancunians I speak to think the opposite is true. Woven into the spectacle of four-bedroom flats in Manchester selling for £3.5m and apartments being snapped up by investors in Hong Kong are companies that symbolise the inequalities of the modern city. A good example is Moda Living, which oversees £1bn of property assets from an HQ in Belgravia in London. In central Manchester, its Angel Gardens development will apparently start filling up with tenants next month. A flat there comes with access to personal trainers, flexible workspaces, a 'rooftop sports court'ù, 'residents' sky lounge'ù, and credit with Uber. Studio flats start at £1,050 a month; three-bedroom apartments at £2,050. For people at the upper range of the income scale, these may look like modest outlays, but for most of the people who live and work in and around the city, they are clearly out of bounds. Beyond the metropolis, what new housing awaits you? As if to symbolise the divide between city and town that sits at the heart of our national angst, well away from the gleam of all those urban towers, most English towns are now ringed by standard-issue developments, in which houses are usually built in line with a miserably small number of basic templates, often beyond people's budgets, and plagued by stories of nonexistent amenities and poor building standards. Again, there is a paradigmatic company here: Persimmon, the building giant that crash-landed in the headlines in late 2017 when its chief executive was about to be paid a bonus package amounting to £110m. Fattened up by loans to house-buyers under the Help To Buy scheme, the company is making profits put at £66,000 per house. It also has a record of shoddy standards and poor service crystallised by a quote given to the makers of a Channel 4 documentary earlier this year: 'We fully accept that on too many occasions in the past we have fallen short on customer care and the speed and empathy with which we dealt with problems.'As things stand, the future seems to fall between this model of precarious property ownership and a top end reserved for a tiny urban aristocracy, with a growing number of people clinging on in a private-rented sector which is forecast to soon contain one in four households, and is often a byword for negligent landlords. And what is the response of people in power? As evidenced by madcap plans to extend the right-to-buy concept to housing association homes, the Conservative party is still attached to the very ideas that led us into this mess, and lost for words about anything more relevant: aside from a mention of building standards, the recent Queen's speech made no mention of housing at all. By contrast, looking at Labour's policy on housing gives you the sense of people prepared to think ambitiously. Leaving aside such gimmicky ideas as John McDonnell's suggestion that right to buy should be introduced to the private rented sector, the party wants 'the biggest council housebuilding programme in 30 years'ù, and an annual 100,000 'genuinely affordable homes'to be built, a figure this year's party conference pushed beyond 150,000. There is also a pledge to 'remove the 'òviability loophole', which allows developers to dodge affordable housing obligations'ù. By implication, at the centre of this is an inescapable point: that if we built the houses we needed, the sense of a population often terrified of the future and anxiously hanging on to whatever they have would at last recede. Every so often, you get a glimpse of what such high ideals might mean in practice - something that happened earlier this month, when the Royal Institute of British Architects' annual Stirling prize was awarded to Goldsmith Street, a council-housing development in Norwich. The great flurry of headlines this story created couched what had happened in terms of a miracle - but viewed from another angle, these were just good-quality, green-oriented houses, built in line with people's needs, in the city where they need to live and work. Homes remain the best measure of our national progress, or lack of it: we will know we are living in better times when such things are not thought of as magical, but thoroughly ordinary.

"MPs' Brexit rhetoric risks igniting divisions, warns Justin Welby",-0.125,Negative,"The archbishop of Canterbury has warned the inflammatory language used by Boris Johnson and other parliamentarians risks pouring petrol over Brexit divisions. Justin Welby said the UK had become consumed by 'an abusive and binary approach to political decisions'and amplification on social media made it 'extraordinarily dangerous to use careless comments'ù. The prime minister has refused to stop describing the Benn act, which is designed to block a no-deal Brexit, as the 'surrender act'ù, despite criticism of the way in which this paints his opponents in parliament as traitors guilty of a betrayal. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Welby said he was shocked by Johnson's recent dismissal of concerns about threats to MPs as 'humbug'ù. Johnson went on to say the best way to honour the memory of the MP Jo Cox, who was murdered by a far-right terrorist during the EU referendum campaign, was 'to get Brexit done'ù. Welby said: '[Concerns] should never be dismissed in that way. Death threats are really serious and they need to be taken seriously. All sides need to say: 'òThat is totally and utterly unacceptable.''Welby said politicians could no longer behave like Johnson's political hero. '[Winston] Churchill was well known for his somewhat inflammatory putdowns in parliament. But this is happening at a time when we have social media, which amplifies things,'he said. 'In a time of deep uncertainty, a much smaller amount of petrol is a much more dangerous thing than it was in a time when people were secure. There is a great danger to doing it when we're already in a very polarised and volatile situation.'Speaking on a visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where he has been highlighting the Ebola outbreak, Welby said: 'I think we have become addicted to an abusive and binary approach to political decisions: 'òit's either this or you're my total enemy.' 'There have been inflammatory words used on all sides, in parliament and outside - 'òtraitor', 'òfascist', all kinds of really bad things have been said at the highest level in politics.'Speaking about the parliamentary debate in which Johnson used the term 'humbug'ù, Welby said it was not only the prime minister who had used inflammatory language. 'Nor was it only the Conservatives,'he said. 'There were a great deal of really difficult things, really bad things being said. 'Within an environment where we've seen the biggest rise in hate crime, and particularly antisemitic crime and Islamophobic crime, the amplification given by social media makes it extraordinarily dangerous to use careless comments.'The archbishop said many MPs and peers had been driven to 'the end of their tether'by the Brexit process and had approached him for guidance.

Turkeys won't vote for Christmas when the polls are telling them they'll be stuffed,0.125,Positive,"When Australia sneezes, the world catches a cold. So be warned that they had an unusually early and quite nasty flu season down under this year. I mention this because fear of the flu is one of the hidden reasons why Boris Johnson craves a pre-Christmas election. Senior NHS officials have warned ministers that the severe flu season in Australia is likely to be a harbinger of the same here. That will compound what already threatens to be a grim winter for a stretched health service. Better, then, from a Conservative perspective, to have an election in the first half of December rather than wait until January or February when news bulletins may be nightly leading with reports of a winter crisis putting more pressure on intensive care and high-dependency units than the NHS can cope with. The thing most worrying to ministers is a repeat of the winter of 2017-18 when a bad flu season in Australia was followed by a killer one in Britain, which saw deaths hit a 42-year peak after the flu jab failed to work in the majority of cases. Because a winter crisis in the NHS would be menacing to the Tories' electoral prospects it would be conversely advantageous for Labour. They would be armed with ammunition for their argument that the Conservatives have run down key public services. Labour people also think they would be able to move the national conversation off Brexit and on to a topic where the party is much more comfortable. The salience of the NHS as an issue with the voters typically rockets after Christmas, whether or not there is a flu epidemic. Labour people won't say this in public unless they are complete idiots, but I know that the prospect of a winter NHS crisis has featured in shadow cabinet debates about whether to agree to a pre-Christmas election. Politicians are often at their most dishonest when it comes to election timing and neither party is being straight about their reasons for wanting or not wanting to fight a campaign held to a festive soundtrack of perfume ads and gritting lorries. Begin with Boris Johnson. He's already made two thwarted bids to trigger an election and plans another after MPs stymied his attempt to ram the Brexit legislation through parliament in a breakneck three days. He claims he needs an election because an obstructive parliament is standing in the way of his mission to 'get Brexit done'ù. Yet the means to get on with doing it are in his own hands. He can simply unpause the withdrawal legislation. It was approved in principle by a majority of 30, a chunky margin in the current circumstances. It is notable that Jeremy Corbyn has not disciplined any of the 19 Labour MPs who helped the Tory leader to that victory by joining him in the aye lobby for the bill's second reading. One of Labour's frontbench, Jo Platt, voted with the Tories and she hasn't been sacked from her job, which would be the usual sanction against a member of the shadow team who defied the party whip. This is better than a nod and a wink to the pro-Brexit contingent of Labour MPs that Mr Corbyn would think himself suited if the legislation proceeded through parliament. If the government offered a more reasonable timetable for scrutiny of the withdrawal agreement, it would almost certainly be agreed to. It would also be extremely likely that the European Union would offer a sufficiently ample extension for that to happen. Of course - and this is an important reason why he wants a quick election - the Johnson deal could start to fall apart once it is subject to detailed examination and the coalition that won him the second reading vote might unravel. If parliament wrecked the legislation further down the track, he could always return to his demand for an election - with more force. He wants a swift election because his chief strategist, Dominic Cummings, calculates that this is the way to maximise the chance of victory by framing it as the 'people versus parliament'contest that he has been preparing for from the moment he moved in to Number 10. Not all Tories think this a sensible strategy. Some believe, and this includes a fair number of the cabinet, that they'd have a more powerful pitch if they held off until next year and went to the country after Brexit had been 'done'ù. In truth, it would not be 'done'at all, but they would present it as such and hope to bank an electoral reward. Other Tories are anxious about the corrosive consequences for trust in our democratic institutions of waging a 'people versus parliament'election. A winter election is unpopular with some Conservative MPs for other reasons. Their Scottish contingent, already an endangered species, don't fancy the thought of canvassing on dark streets in hostile weather. Tories who will be defending Remain-leaning seats against Lib Dem challengers will be made more vulnerable in a campaign that polarises on Remain/Leave lines. But the Cummings battle plan regards them as sacrificeable. The road to a Conservative majority that he envisages does not run through Scotland or even Surrey, but through taking seats off Labour in the north of England, the Midlands and Wales. In the old days, Mr Johnson would have got an election by simply dropping in on the Queen and asking for one. Thanks to the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, it is very hard for him to engineer a contest without the cooperation of the opposition. Labour is a mess of splits on the question. There are some hardcore Corbynites who seem genuinely keen on an election and sincerely convinced that the opinion polls are all wrong when they report that the party is dismally unpopular and its leader even more voter-repellent. His residual devotees cling to the faith that the miraculous gifts of Saint Jeremy will stun everyone by leading the party to triumph. When the shadow cabinet met on Tuesday, Laura Pidcock, the shadow minister for employment rights, launched into a little speech in which she declared: 'Let's sweep these establishment Tories from power with an insurgent Labour party!'Once Ms Pidcock had expended herself, Barbara Keeley, the shadow minister for mental health, drily responded: 'I don't see much insurgency in Salford.'At an informal meeting of some of the shadow cabinet on Thursday, two of the strongest voices against allowing an election were John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Nick Brown, the chief whip. Both have been bombarded by election-averse Labour MPs telling them that not only should there not be one, but that there will be a massive rebellion if the party leadership tries to whip Labour MPs to facilitate a pre-Christmas contest. 'Do I fancy shivering on doorsteps in December trying to explain our Brexit policy?'says one Labour MP. 'What do you think?'Another reports: 'Various WhatsApp groups of Labour MPs are going wild with people telling colleagues that they won't vote for an election.'The obvious explanation is that turkeys don't vote for Christmas, especially when the turkeys can read opinion polls suggesting that they will be stuffed. Members of Labour's parliamentary committee, senior MPs who act as sort of shop stewards for their colleagues, were alarmed when they had a meeting last week with Jennie Formby, the party's general secretary. She was asked how many constituencies still hadn't selected a candidate and which ones were on the key seat list. I'm told that the general secretary couldn't answer either of these election-critical questions. Many of the senior officials responsible for Labour's effort during the 2017 campaign have been purged from party headquarters or paid off. I hear that some are now being sounded out about coming back, such are the fears that Labour is not in a fit state to fight a campaign. Mr Corbyn's instinctive reflexes have previously been to go for it. He's repeatedly called for an election and he's finding it an increasing struggle to muster plausible excuses for why Labour won't agree to one now. A proud man and a stubborn one, he doesn't like looking scared of a contest and his remaining fans are telling him that he is a brilliant campaigner who will turn things around as he did in 2017. But colleagues who have spoken to the Labour leader very recently have come away concluding that he is 'genuinely procrastinating'ù. It is rarely an appealing look for a party to be frightened of an election and Labour could pay a penalty when it ultimately has to face the voters. To the majority of Labour MPs, that risk is outweighed by the perils of a pre-Christmas contest. Better, they think, to run scared than to get run over.

Brexit 'do or die': what are Boris Johnson's options now?,-0.25,Negative,"Boris Johnson set out a new ultimatum on Thursday night to MPs: back a general election before Christmas in exchange for more time to scrutinise the Brexit deal. In a letter to Jeremy Corbyn, he sought to present himself as open to compromise by telling the Labour leader that he would, after weeks of rancour, give parliament 'all possible time'- including late and early finishes and weekend sessions - to scrutinise his withdrawal agreement bill, and aim to ratify it by 6 November. Whether the bill passes or not, he says, the arrangement would require Corbyn to agree to dissolve parliament immediately and hold an election on 12 December. His letter says that he expects Brussels to now grant an extension until 31 January. 'You have repeatedly said that once the EU accepts parliament's request for a delay until 31 January, then you would immediately support an election,'he writes. 'I assume this remains your position and therefore you will support an election next week.'Because he thinks that if Corbyn accepts, the move will give him the best chance of securing a Brexit deal and winning a subsequent election - or failing to get a deal but winning an election by casting Corbyn as the obstacle. Even if Corbyn rejects the offer, Johnson will calculate that Downing Street will again be able to present a 'people vs parliament'dichotomy to the public. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, two thirds of MPs would have to back a motion asking for an early general election. The motion will be tabled on Monday. Labour appeared poised to reject the bill, with Corbyn immediately saying that he would not support an election until a no-deal Brexit was 'off the table'ù. But there will be no formal decision from the frontbench until Friday morning. Several shadow cabinet members are said to be minded to reject Johnson's offer, arguing that 6 November is an artificial deadline for the withdrawal agreement bill. Backbenchers are also said to be anxious about a winter election. But the Momentum campaign group urged the party to back an election, saying: 'Bring it on.'If it does reject the offer, Labour is likely to argue that Johnson is simply trying to distract from his failure to achieve his 'do or die'31 October Brexit promise and seek to portray Johnson as serially dishonest and impossible to trust on Brexit. Sources said that while the significant changes would need to be digested, they could easily alter plans for an extension - which could now be put on hold until the next steps in Westminster have been clarified. Downing Street sources say that they will pull the withdrawal agreement bill to deny MPs the chance to scrutinise it. And they will simply raise the idea again day after day - calculating that parliamentary paralysis will eventually force Labour to concede that an election is inevitable. ",0.5,Positive
Not even the PM's narcissism can protect him as cracks show,0.875,Positive,"Finally, some clarity. After months of pretence, almost everyone in Westminster has abandoned any pretence to having a plan. Now it's more or less a total mind-fuck. An out of control rollercoaster of parallel universes in which any number of incompatible things can be both true and not true simultaneously. Labour both want an election and don't want an election. They also want to get Brexit done but have no idea what Brexit they want to get done. The Tories also want an election but don't know how or when to get one. They also would quite like Boris Johnson's Brexit deal to pass, while secretly wishing they had voted for Theresa May's rather better - low bar, admittedly - deal when they had the chance. What's even weirder is that this is the new normal. No one finds any of this to be in the slightest bit odd. There are one or two outliers who still cling to the notion that they have some influence over events. Dominic Cummings can often be found hiding in corners of parliament, torn shirt, ripped jeans, laces untied imagining himself to be a teenage Thomas Cromwell - let's hope no one tells him how that story ended - while everyone else thinks he's a bit of a dick. 'Plan A was for Plan B to fail,'he mutters. 'We then blindside the opposition by ignoring Plans C and D and racing through to Plan E, which was to resort to Plan A that had already failed. I'm a genius. I have the country exactly where I want it.'He finishes with the manic laugh of a Bond villain about to be eaten by his own crocodiles and then vanishes into the shadows. Control, alt, delete. Classic Dom. Boris Johnson is also finding it tough going. He's used to a world that can be bent to his will. Where his actions have no consequences. But now the cracks in the World King are beginning to show. Not even his narcissism is enough to protect him any more. His body language hints at betrayal and his eyes display the silent terror of a man who fears he's in the process of being found out. Kidding himself that he actually believes in the thing that he knows to be untrue. Brexit is corroding what's left of his integrity from the inside. He is the hollow man, bellowing against the dying of his sense of self. No longer capable of looking himself in the eye. Even his own backbenchers have begun to doubt him. Where once they had saluted him as the Saviour who could deliver them a promised Brexit, now they saw a false prophet. A man who had flogged them a get-rich-quick Ponzi Brexit scheme but had lost far more votes than he had ever won. The public might still be taken in by his crumbling facade, but they weren't and for Johnson's second prime minister's questions in nearly 100 days in office, Tory MPs could barely muster a cheer. So fickle. Johnson appeared rattled from the start. It hadn't helped that Tory Patrick McLoughlin had pointed out that the Incredible Sulk had achieved something no one thought possible. He had not only lost yet another Brexit vote but his temper with it. Epic fail. But when Jeremy Corbyn had played it safe by asking six relatively undemanding questions, Boris had visibly imploded. His speech patterns, already staccato, morphed into morse code and his arms alternatively punched the air randomly and flailed helplessly. Labour DOT have voted DOT to delay DASH Brexit, he boomed. That is why DOT we will still DASH be leaving on DASH October 31st. The logic was impeccable. For a three-year-old. He was also equally confused about just how many hospitals he was single-handedly building. First it was DOT 20. Then it was DASH 40. Then it was back to DASH 20. The real answer was none. 'They said we'd never get our deal through the Commons,'Johnson insisted. Not even his own front bench could bring themselves to break it to him that he hadn't actually managed that. The Sulk is so confused he can no longer even remember that he had suspended his own legislation the night before. Johnson ended by reiterating that the spaceport at Newquay that is never going to be built was already under construction. The queue to be on the first flight is already 16 million strong. All hoping they never return. Boris picked up one of his arms that had come loose and shuffled off to dream up another cunning plan. DOT DOT DOT DASH DASH DASH DOT DOT DOT. ",-1.625,Negative
The Guardian view on the Brexit votes: parliament must not waste the precious time it has won,0.625,Positive,"The House of Commons last night successfully put the brakes on the prime minister's attempt to deliver Brexit at breakneck speed. Parliament must now attempt to steer Britain away from the rocks of a Brexit deal which was hastily conceived and which, if enacted, would leave the country to repent at leisure. Boris Johnson will claim, with justification, that the backing by MPs of a second reading for his withdrawal bill, by a majority of 30, was a significant victory. After all, Theresa May never managed as much. But the defeat of the government's programme motion by 322 votes to 308 means that the prime minister will not be able to force MPs to vote on it by Thursday evening. Having failed to rush his legislation through parliament, Mr Johnson has announced his intention to pause it, while the EU considers the request that he was forced to send for an extension beyond the 31 October deadline for Brexit. The prime minister will urge Brussels to make that extension short. Whatever its length, MPs who oppose his version of Brexit, which pushes the country towards a deregulated, disunited and poorer future, must now use the time to devise a coherent cross-party plan to achieve a better outcome. The Labour MPs who voted for a second reading of Mr Johnson's bill will receive fierce criticism. But most did so not because they back Mr Johnson's deal, but with the intention of amending and softening it, perhaps through a customs union. All options and potential compromises must now be explored by the opposition parties, because Mr Johnson's version of Brexit cannot be allowed to stand. The government's desire to bludgeon the withdrawal bill through the House of Commons in three days flat represented a brazen attempt to exploit a mood of national exhaustion with Brexit. To table a programme motion requiring parliament to give its verdict on Mr Johnson's deal within 72 hours was an absurdity. As has been pointed out, the Wild Animals in Circuses Act underwent greater parliamentary scrutiny. MPs first saw the legal text of Mr Johnson's new deal - which proposes a far harder Brexit than Mrs May's version - on Monday evening. It is 110 pages long and separate explanatory notes run to 125 pages. Scandalously, its publication was accompanied not by an economic impact assessment, but by the blithe assurance of Sajid Javid that the deal is 'self-evidently'in Britain's interest. It soon turned out that a guarantee of workers' rights had been removed from the withdrawal bill and placed in the non-binding political declaration. The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, inadvertently misled the House of Lords by saying that no exit forms would be required to send goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. In fact, such forms will be required, much to the fury of the Democratic Unionist party. It also emerged that Mr Johnson's deal could lead to a no-deal exit on WTO terms in December 2020. The notion that matters of this gravity and magnitude should have been considered on the hoof, without proper scrutiny, was an affront to parliamentary democracy. But such effrontery has been the modus operandi of this government ever since Mr Johnson became prime minister. Starting with the unlawful move to prorogue parliament for five weeks, the strategy has been to bully MPs, wilfully pitting the executive against the legislature, while appealing to an alleged popular will to 'get Brexit done'ù. The prime minister and his aides have trashed precedent and propriety, daring MPs to cry foul. This assault on the Commons during the biggest national crisis for decades has its roots in deep political insecurity. Mr Johnson has no majority. The Benn act effectively closed off the option of leaving with no deal at the end of the month. Pursuing a whirlwind Brexit and caricaturing all opposition as a remain plot, the prime minister and his allies hoped that enough MPs would be sufficiently cowed and weary to rush through a deal significantly harder than that proposed by Mrs May. The plan failed. Now parliamentarians opposing Mr Johnson's vision of a deregulated Britain, cut loose from its major trading partners, have a little more time. They must use it. ",-0.125,Negative
