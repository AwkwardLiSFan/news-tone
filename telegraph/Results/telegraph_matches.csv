Woodford protÈgÈ Mark Barnett fired from £1.3bn investment trust
",0,Neutral,"Embattled investor Mark Barnett has been fired from running the £1.3bn Edinburgh Investment Trust due to poor performance. Investment trusts, unlike open-ended funds, have independent boards that can hand assets to another company if it sees fit. Mark Barnett, who works for American fund house Invesco, has run the trust since 2014 after taking over from his mentor and colleague Neil Woodford. He ran the investments in the same style as his predecessor,†aiming to provide a growing income by investing in undervalued British companies known as ""value stocks,†with a preference for smaller businesses. This style of investing has been out of favour for some time, particularly since the Brexit referendum in June 2016. Since then, the trust's share price has fallen by 10pc while the FTSE All Share index, a broad measure of the British stock market, has risen 32pc. Rival equity income trusts have enjoyed share price total returns of 26pc on average. ",0,Neutral

Politics latest news: Boris Johnson rows back on appetite for 'Australia style' Brexit deal
",-0.375,Negative,"The Government is rowing back on its desire to strike an Australia-style deal with the European Union, Boris Johnson has suggested, as the deadline for reaching an agreement with the bloc nears. The Prime Minister said the UK could ""more than live with"" an Australia-style arrangement, which could involve a general ""framework"" agreement to cooperate on†trade, foreign policy†and development. Mr Johnson has previously held up the deals negotiated by Australia and Canada as potential models for the UK to follow. His comments on Sunday suggest officials are now more interested in a Canada-style deal than that of Australia. ""All we're asking our friends and partners to offer is terms that they've already offered to Canada which is you know a long way away from here,"" he told the BBC. ""We're very close to our European friends and partners, we've been members of the EU for 45 years, I see no reason why we shouldn't get those sorts of terms."" ""I don't want the Australian-WTO type outcome, particularly, but we can more than live with it."" The deadline of the middle of October for negotiating a free trade agreement is nearing, with both sides suggesting a deal is still technically possible but acknowledging disagreements over fisheries and state aid.

Chairman of election watchdog is forced out
",-0.25,Negative,"The chairman of the election watchdog is being forced to stand down after the body drew fury from the Conservatives over a botched attempt to hand itself powers to prosecute political parties. Sir John Holmes is understood to have been told by MPs that he cannot continue in the role - after seeking to extend his four-year term beyond December. The Electoral Commission is also now shelving plans to acquire powers to prosecute scores of criminal offences itself, rather than referring suspected breaches to the police and Crown ≠Prosecution Service. It comes after the Conservatives raised ""serious concerns""ù about the leadership and accountability of the watchdog, over the proposals, which Amanda Milling, the party chairman, said would have amounted to the body ""marking its own homework""ù. Writing in The Sunday Telegraph in August, Ms Milling said: ""The commission should be focusing on improving its core functions, not trying to expand its empire. If the commission fails to make these changes and do the job it was set up to do then the only option would be to abolish it.""ù This weekend, a commission spokesman said the body had ""paused""ù the move, stating that ""we do not currently have broad stakeholder understanding and consent""ù. Sir John, who has chaired the commission since 2017, faced criticism when this newspaper revealed in 2018 that, months after being nominated as the body's chairman, he said in a speech that he ""regret[ted] the result""ù of the 2016 Brexit referendum and complained about ""the panoply of Eurosceptic nonsense about the EU""ù heard during the campaign. Brexiteers have repeatedly accused the commission of bias against pro-Leave campaigners. Sir John is understood to have informed the Speaker's committee on the Electoral Commission, which oversees the body, that he wished to continue in his role beyond the initial four-year term. His predecessor, Jenny Watson, served for two terms, totalling eight years. But the former civil servant's request was turned down after members of the panel concluded that ""all is not well""ù at the commission, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Last week, the committee began the process of appointing a replacement, with a public recruitment campaign expected to begin shortly. Under the Political Parties and Elections Act, the chairman cannot be a member of a political party, or anyone who has served as an MP or donated to a party in the last five years. Sir John gave the commissioners' endorsement to the push by Bob Posner, the body's chief executive, to hand itself powers to prosecute parties and campaign groups - now ""paused""ù. A spokesman for the commission said: ""We thank him for his leadership of and commitment to the commission over the past four years and for all his work in support of the UK's democratic processes.""ù The spokesman added: ""We planned to consult later this year on changes to our enforcement policy, which would have included a draft prosecution ≠policy. However, while we have had positive discussions with a range of stakeholders, we do not currently have broad stakeholder understanding and consent. ""We hope to build consensus in due course, but our current focus is to work to prepare for the polls taking place next May, to ensure that these elections can be delivered safely and effectively. We have therefore paused this work.""ù ",-0.375,Negative

Majority of Tory voters believe Boris Johnson should curb European human rights laws†according to poll
",0.25,Positive,"A majority of Conservative voters believe Boris Johnson should curb European human rights laws after the UK's independence from the EU, according to a poll. A survey of 1,500 Tory voters shows that more than half of those who voted for the Tories last year would back human rights reforms, while a similar proportion believe the current stamp duty holiday should be extended beyond its scheduled end in March. The findings form part of a poll in which voters who backed the Conservatives last year gave their view on Boris Johnson's performance ahead of the party's annual conference this weekend. Overall, 60 per cent said they approved of Mr Johnson's performance since becoming Prime Minister, while 20 per cent disapproved. Some 74 per cent approved of Rishi Sunak's performance as Chancellor since he replaced Sajid Javid in February, compared to just 7 per cent who disapproved.

Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen 'to take stock of trade negotiations and discuss next steps'
",0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson will hold urgent talks with the president of the European Commission on Saturday afternoon, after his top Brexit official warned trade negotiation would fail unless the EU caved over fishing rights.† The Prime Minister and Ursula von der Leyen will hold their first conference call on Brexit since June ""to take stock of negotiations and discuss next steps,""ù a Number 10 spokesman said. † News of the video conference call came as the last scheduled round of UK-EU trade negotiations ended in Brussels. The pound rose by as much 0.5 percent on the hopes it would bring a breakthrough. ""Where there is a will, there is a way so I think we should intensify the negotiations,"" said Mrs von der Leyen, who will put the prime minister under pressure to soften the British position on access to UK waters after the end of the Brexit transition period.† Mrs von der Leyen on Friday said neither side could afford no deal during the coronavirus pandemic. But she demanded concessions over level playing field commitments on state aid laws and the enforcement of the trade deal.† She wants a stricter system of enforcement of subsidy law and a way to ensure standards stay up to date.† British negotiators will hope Mr Johnson will convince Mrs von der Leyen to begin intensive and secret †""tunnel talks""ù in the run up to the October 15 EU summit. † ""On fisheries the gap between us is unfortunately very large and, without further realism and flexibility from the EU risks being impossible to bridge,"" warned David Frost, the UK's chief negotiator after the ninth round of talks. A British compromise offer of a three year transition period for fishing quotas, with the UK share increasing over time, fell short of EU expectations this week. France, in particular, is pushing hard for a permanent quota system. Michel Barnier, the EU's negotiator, said there had been ""positive new developments"" in police cooperation and aviation safety but ""persistent serious divergences on matters of major importance for the European Union.""† Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, said, ""As long as negotiations are ongoing I remain optimistic [...] It will be a crucial phase over the next few days."" ""The EU needs to hear at the highest level that the UK government is serious about a deal,""ù one diplomatic source said. Getting a deal finalised by the end of October would give the EU time to ratify the deal before January 1 and avoid no deal, which would mean trading on less lucrative WTO terms.† ",0,Neutral

Brexit's Internal Market Bill explained: what is it, and why is it so controversial?
",0,Neutral,"This was first published in The Telegraph's Refresher newsletter. For more facts and explanation behind the week's biggest political stories,†sign up to the Refresher here†- straight to your inbox every Wednesday afternoon for free. Aroused from their slumbers with hackles up, the backbench pack were prepared to show some teeth. It was the chairman of the 1922 committee who seemed to sum up the mood. ""If you keep whacking a dog, don't be surprised when it bites you back,""ù Sir Charles Walker warned before joining 29 of his colleagues to abstain on the Government's new Brexit legislation. Boris Johnson might have gone on to clear a crucial Commons hurdle over the Internal Market Bill, but rebels believe many MPs have simply decided to ""hold their fire""ù. The controversial Bill has stoked up division inside the Conservative Party that is reminiscent of the high-stakes Brexit brinkmanship we witnessed last year. But this time it goes further than Leave or Remain. Prominent Eurosceptics, such as Lord Howard and former attorney general Geoffrey Cox, have raised their concerns over the Government's admission that the Bill, if enacted, would break international law. That it would be, as Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland Secretary insisted, in a ""very specific and limited way""ù did little to alleviate their fears. To date, all living former Prime Ministers, five ex-Conservative party leaders and 30 of the party's MPs have expressed their discomfort. Ministers (well, most of them) are standing firm. In the Commons on Monday 14 September, Mr Johnson insisted the legislation was necessary to prevent the EU taking an ""extreme and unreasonable"" interpretation of the provisions in the Withdrawal Agreement relating to Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister warned that some in Brussels were now threatening to block UK agri-food exports to the EU, and to insist on tariffs on all goods moving to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. ""Absurd and self-defeating as that action would be even as we debate this matter, the EU still have not taken this revolver off the table,"" he said. However, Ed Miliband, shadow business secretary, repeatedly asked the Prime Minister to explain how the Bill would protect Northern Ireland from the threat of a potential food blockade. ""I know you're a details man. Show me the blockade. I will give way to you,""ù Mr Miliband scoffed, but the Prime Minister merely shook his head in disdain. Amal Clooney, the famous human rights lawyer, resigned as the UK's special envoy on media freedom in protest at the Government's plan to break international law with the Internal Market Bill. She called the Bill ""lamentable"". The UK's internal market dates back to the early 1700s, when it was created to ensure ""open and unhindered trade""ù across the four nations. But when the UK joined the then-European Economic Community in 1973, most of the British trade laws were replaced by European laws. It was Margaret Thatcher's government in the 1980s that helped to forge the formal creation of the single market between EU nations. It was designed to open European markets to British exporters and to level the playing field for UK firms across the continent. Regarding all EU member states as one territory, the bloc devised rules about everything from food standards to fisheries to ensure consistency across the bloc. The Internal Market Bill is its proposed replacement, aiming to ensure all four of the UK's home nations are not limited by regulations determined by each devolved Government. It also aims to guarantee the international community has access to the UK as a whole, knowing the standards and rules are the same throughout. One of the major issues is how this can apply to Northern Ireland when it shares a border with the Republic of Ireland, which will remain in the EU. This where the controversy kicks in. The Bill could contradict the Withdrawal Agreement, and therefore international law, as it says ministers could have the power to ""disapply"" previously agreed rules relating to the movement of goods. This includes those under the Northern Ireland Protocol. On September 22, an amendment tabled by the Government to head off a Tory backbench rebellion was accepted without the need for a vote, clearing the Commons committee stage. The proposal imposes†a ""parliamentary lock"" on any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement, giving Parliament the final say on whether it is appropriate to renege on the treaty. However, while the legislation will return to the Commons next week, ministers intend to delay its final stages in the House of Lords until after a crunch EU summit in mid-October where they hope to sign off on a trade deal.† This would likely mean that the Bill would not return to the Commons again until December, just weeks before the transition period ends. Originally Downing Street threatened to withdraw the whip from rebels who defied the Government, but made significant concessions when it accepted changes to the Bill in line with their demands. For some, including Theresa May, it isn't enough to allow Parliament a say over whether international law is broken. There shouldn't be provision to break the law in the first place. Boris Johnson has got his Bill through the high-stakes first-round votes in the Commons, but he might not have seen the back of the rebels just yet.† ",0,Neutral

Stockpile pet food and plan emergency Brexit airlifts, animal charities tell Government
",-0.5,Negative,"Britain must stockpile pet food and livestock feed and plan for airlifts of medical supplies to protect animals from Brexit chaos next year, leading charities will warn on Wednesday.† The end of the Brexit transition period on December 31 could cause shortages of food for pets and livestock as well as other vital supplies, the 12 campaign groups said.† Even if there is a trade deal, delays and queues are expected at key ports such as Dover.† Disruption to medical supplies would not only be ""potentially devastating""ù for individual animals but make it harder to †""control disease outbreaks,""ù the 12 charities told†Environment Secretary George Eustice in a letter exclusively obtained by the Telegraph. ""We believe central and devolved governments need to make contingency plans for the stockpiling of veterinary medicines and animal feed,""ù the charities, who are part of the UK-EU animal welfare taskforce, said.† ""Central government should further explore the use of air freight [...] †to mitigate risks associated with veterinary medicine availability issues,""ù the taskforce said, raising the prospect of emergency airlifts of supplies from the EU.† Some government estimates for a no deal Brexit estimate queues of up to 7,000 lorries stretching into Kent. The animal welfare groups called for dedicated rest areas for animals along motorways, particularly the M20 in Kent, and at the ports themselves.† The charities, which included the RSPCA and Animal Defenders International, said that the UK imports two thirds of its animal feed and feed ingredients from the EU. It imports all of its pet food from the EU, they said, or makes it with EU ingredients. They called for a communication campaign for pet owners to ensure they had enough food for their animals.† The UK government and the governments of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland should build up reserves of farmed animal feed in case of supply chain disruption, they said. A minimum of four to 12 week's supplies of medicines needed to be stockpiled, the charities said.† The final scheduled round of Brexit trade negotiations began on Tuesday in Brussels amid cautious optimism that a deal could be struck by the October 15 EU Summit, if both sides compromise.† Even if a trade deal is agreed, there will need to be more border checks than now because the UK will have left the Single Market and Customs Union.† The change will be particularly pronounced in Northern Ireland, which will continue to be subject to EU animal health rules after the end of the transition period.† That is necessary to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland but it means that Northern Irish cats, dogs and ferrets will have different pet passports to those on the British mainland.† ""Pet passports for cats, dogs and ferrets will be required as standard when crossing the Irish Sea,""ù the charities said in their letter before calling for updated travel advice for owners. †† The Telegraph understands that EU officials are in the process of designing the Northern Irish pet passport. It is expected to be blue and will not have any reference to the United Kingdom on it.† British cats, dogs and ferrets will have to show a UK pet passport before travelling to Northern Ireland.† That will be designed by British officials, if the EU lists the UK as a country where it is safe for pets to visit from.† ",-0.125,Negative

Banks must give customers 'fair warning' before closing expat accounts, MPs warn
",-0.125,Negative,"Banks planning to close down accounts of Britons living in the EU because of Brexit must give customers sufficient warning to make other arrangements, an influential group of MPs has said. Mel Stride of the Treasury Select Committee, which scrutinises HM Treasury, has written to the head of the Financial Conduct Authority, Chris Woolard, asking the regulator to set out how much notice it expects banks to give to customers, if they are planning to terminate services.† It comes after this newspaper broke the story at the beginning of September that Britain's biggest bank Lloyds, which also owns Halifax and Bank of Scotland, is closing†13,000 expat retail and business accounts in Holland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Germany and Slovakia from November.† Other banks are preparing to make similar arrangements, but most†have stayed silent on how customers will be affected so far.† Mel Stride said banks had a duty to come clean on any changes as soon as possible and before they stripped expat clients of their ""only source of banking""ù.† ""Many British expats in the EU are being told that their UK bank accounts will be terminated at the end of the year. ""It's vital that they're given sufficient warning so that they have time to make alternative arrangements,""ù he said.† After Brexit,†banks will no longer be able to provide UK banking services to expats resident in EU countries unless they set up a separate legal entity in each region. This will create†additional costs for banks and they are instead cutting†services†in countries where it no longer makes financial sense to operate. Customers face a bank account closure lottery as it is impossible to know which bank will be maintaining services†and which will not. HSBC has a large number of customers in France and has already moved some business customers who still use a British bank account to its French arm. It is now considering applying for legal permission to continue to provide UK services in some countries, although is yet to announce any account closures and says retail customers are not affected. Its other large expat customer bases are in Germany and Switzerland.† Barclays is ""reviewing the situation""ù and has said it will write to any affected customers, but is yet to announce closures.† Both Santander and NatWest, which also owns Royal Bank of Scotland, said they were reviewing how Brexit talks were shaping up and currently had no intention to close any of their accounts.

If the EU cannot respect our sovereignty, we should tear up the Brexit deal
",0,Neutral,"The UK can †protect its economy outside the EU system of law by applying the WTO's self-help remedies of tariffs and duties, along with international regulatory rules. †WTO charges would put Eurozone imports back at their correct pricing levels. Most Eurozone producers †would then absorb the expense to protect their market share. New trade deals with other countries will enable the UK to buy the products from elsewhere at competitive world prices. †And international regulatory standards provide protection against systemic †risk arising from the Eurozone. But the UK needs to avoid the trap of EU law, since its acceptance would prevent the UK from protecting itself. †The Withdrawal Agreement commits both parties to achieving a sovereignty-compliant outcome by year end. By definition any resulting arrangements cannot †include EU law, unless Parliament were to hand back sovereignty. †This means replacing the Northern Ireland Protocol, which imposes EU law requirements. If left in place, the Protocol would deny UK businesses with NI operations the shield of WTO protections, †leaving them open to unfairly priced Irish (and other Eurozone) competition. Fortunately, †there are sovereignty-compliant solutions to all of the problems the EU negotiators throw our way. An invisible North-South Irish border can be addressed by so-called ""alternative arrangements""ù, or by guarantees under a mechanism known as ""mutual enforcement""ù. †A level playing field can easily be addressed through WTO-based disciplines. Now the EU may not wish for that. Providing for a sovereign but invisible North-South border would effectively mean the EU has to agree to a favourable trade deal with the whole of the UK. †It is only then that the EU gets out cleanly from its WTO obligations to offer †the same invisible border treatment to the other 44 countries with which it has a land border. The EU may also recoil from a WTO-based approach to the level playing field since this would undo the distortions created by the Eurozone. †However, as a sovereign, †the UK needs to protect its economy for the benefit of its citizens. In addition, †the UK needs its sovereignty to address the financial risk pumped by the Eurozone into the UK and global financial markets. At present, the UK mitigates this risk on behalf of the EU and the rest of the world by imposing top-up capital requirements on businesses †operating here. †The UK can carry on performing this service after year end, if the EU agrees in an FTA to recognise UK financial law and regulation, whatever the shape the UK decides this should have. The EU should feel safe in recognising the UK's regime †since the UK properly applies international standards. If the EU fails to agree a satisfactory sovereign relationship, the UK should tear up the Withdrawal Agreement, including the Protocol. †The EU would be in breach of its commitments, and the UK will then be forced to apply its sovereignty on the basis of unmodified †WTO protections after year end. †The UK will also need (along with the US, the other host of the global financial market) to apply international standards to impose costly capital, collateral and liquidity requirements on exposures to EU financial institutions, †to address Eurozone risk. This would include restrictions on intra-group exposures to Eurozone-based subsidiaries of UK/US-headquartered institutions. Of course, †applying the global rules in this way would cause crippling expense for EU financial firms, and material damage to the EU's growth aspirations. †That is not the outcome the UK seeks. To avoid it, the UK's ask is minimal: a sovereign relationship which continues †trade on a basis no worse than that used by the EU for other countries to which it is less close. †If the EU rejects this it would be an unfriendly act - and one of self-harm.

With 90 days until Brexit, supply chain kinks could cost manufacturers dearly
",0.625,Positive,"Companies are dealing with new responsibilities and navigating new ways of working, while also doing their best to manage continuity of supply against an extraordinary increase in demand. The resource required for things like training first time PPE users and adhering to the new workplace safety protocol has shot through the roof. Of course, these considerations are all in addition to the existing health and safety challenges such as accident prevention, ensuring user compliance, balancing cost and quality, responding to complex legislation and managing inventory. Implementing the new measures is a major undertaking and requires rigorous planning and preparation to address new and diverse challenges. These include how colleagues communicate with each other against a noisy backdrop while remaining socially distanced, thermal scanning at site access points to detect early signs of infection and careful planning of shift patterns to allow for deep cleaning.†† Ensuring facilities have appropriate measures and practices is paramount. Outbreaks at several UK manufacturing and processing sites have highlighted the capacity for the virus to spread on the factory floor, as well as the potential financial and reputational consequences.† A global pandemic isn't the only factor that might have reduced manufacturers' Brexit focus; there is also the inevitable fatigue brought about by the passing of multiple Brexit deadlines. On three occasions companies have built inventories, created warehouse space and developed comprehensive contingency plans, only to be faced with a false start.† The time and money invested into these processes are considerable. Repeated deadline extensions may be limiting the energy that companies will commit to embracing the Government's recent ""Let's get going""ù campaign to once again encourage preparations.

Mr Bailey†was raised by a single mother in the capital, before studying at university while working part time as a security guard. He graduated at 27 before becoming an adviser to David Cameron when he was Prime Minister. Mr Bailey - who was†once described as a ""token ghetto boy"" by a former Labour MP - said the Left was not comfortable with black people who better themselves. He told The Telegraph's†Chopper's Politics podcast, which you can listen to on the audio player above:†""It is basically saying if you do anything outside the Labour left wing view of the world you will get attacked. ""My journey has been useful, an inspiration to my children, we talk about it a lot. The community I come from are all proud of me, whether they are conservative or not.† ""There is nothing token about the life I have led, the challenges I have faced, the victories and losses I have had. And I would say to anybody if you feel you can for far, ambition is a good thing."" Mr Bailey, whose family came to the UK from Jamaica, added: ""The Left don't want you to achieve†because you ask different questions.†The black community has been the chosen victims for the Left so they can always say they're going to†help us and do things.† ""I remember when Jeremy Corbyn said only he can unlock the potential for the black community. My mother said 'what the hell does he think I've been doing for the last 50 years'; she was very offended by that.† ""So, the point I would make is, if, if you continually have a low view of our community you are victimising us, you've got to believe in talent in the community. ""That's why you'll hear me talk about having some kind of ambition. That's almost self belief, isn't it? ""And I think it's important that people on the Left remove the idea that unless we believe what they believe that's the only way we can prosper.† ""I think it's very damaging to the black community and increasingly the black community are pushing back on that†and more and more black people ... are†challenging the very strong Leftwing views held in our community."" Mr Bailey who grew up on the streets of north London also said he has been stopped by the police ""tens of times"" and admitted that this was ""probably"" more than his white friends. He said: ""Is the Met perfect? Of course not because it is made up of people. Are they doing considerably better? Absolutely.† ""What we should be doing is supporting them to do better, not always beating them over the head because nobody - particularly black communities benefit from a police force that is afraid to do its job."" Mr Bailey is backing a new policing tactic called Scan and Search which uses scanners to search people for knives to avoid the need for invasive searches. Mr Bailey added: ""If a tactic is racist or not, falls to the people who deliver it. I don't believe the police are racist, not all police officers are racist, that is a ridiculous assertion. Mr Bailey said he was receiving regular support from Mr Johnson who was encouraging people to support his campaign and last spoke to the Prime Minister four days ago. Mr Bailey brushed off claims in the summer that donors were losing faith in his campaign, saying: ""The first thing we did was run to the PM and say 'where is this noise coming from'. ""His answer to me was twofold: he said 'firstly it is not coming from me Shaun, I have your back and what do you need me to do'.

Singapore trade deal hampered by row over bank licences†

The easiest way to get out of this mess would be to conclude a free-trade deal with Brussels, but that has its own complications...

Theresa May says she cannot support Boris Johnson's Internal Market Bill despite PM's concessions

Mr Johnson has conceded that Parliament may have a say before proposed ministerial powers to break international law are used.

Liz Truss to rip up rules on assessing trade deals
",0.25,Positive,"Liz Truss is ready to rip up the Trade Department's rule books on assessing deals in a bid to improve how it measures the economic benefits of its post-Brexit ""Global Britain""ù project.† The Trade Secretary has drafted in experts to overhaul the department's models. Tony Venables, an economics professor at Oxford University, will lead a team including Graham Gudgin of Cambridge University, Swati Dhingra of the London School of Economics, Michael Plummer of John Hopkins University and Christine McDaniel of George Mason University. Their task will be to advise the chief economist of the Department for International Trade (DIT) on how to adapt its traditional ""trade gravity""ù model, which gives weight to the proximity of trading partners, to focus more on trade in services, including digital and data.† Official data has projected that certain trade deals could shrink the economy and the new results are therefore likely to cast the Government's Global Britain† trade deals in a more favourable light, given the UK is the second-largest exporter of services globally. Indeed, Dr Gudgin published a paper in 2017 arguing that the trade gravity model generated overly pessimistic predictions of the impact of Brexit on the UK economy. Ms Truss said: ""Better modelling will help us capture the full benefits of free trade agreements and strike British-shaped deals that suit our economy and deliver for the whole country.""ù DIT has also asked that the panel accounts for the benefits of securing open trade routes and low tariffs compared to scenarios where protectionism might increase.† ""Deep and dynamic free trade deals are even more valuable when trade barriers elsewhere are high, and we want our economic assessments to reflect that,""ù Ms Truss added. DIT's initial scoping assessment of the impact of Britain leaving the EU - its closest trading partner - forecast a 5pc loss of GDP over 15 years. Meanwhile, official estimates saw up to a 0.01pc loss of GDP from a deal with New Zealand - the UK's most distant trading partner. The deals Britain is seeking to strike with non-EU countries are not expected cumulatively to compensate for the loss of membership of the single market and customs union under current modelling, but these estimates are based on data from 2011. The review is expected to take about a year so the results will not be ready in time to assess the impact of the UK-Japan trade deal agreed ""in principle""ù last week, or any other free trade agreements signed in the meantime. Trade talks are also under way with the EU, US, New Zealand, Australia and Canada, with a goal of joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) - of which Canada, Japan and Australia are members - in the longer term.

Lord Keen: A lawyer and advocate general unafraid of controversy
",0,Neutral,"In a long and colourful career, Lord Keen has not been afraid to cause controversy. As a defence lawyer he represented Princess Diana's driver, Henri Paul, and alleged Pan Am bomber Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah. In his role as the Scottish advocate general, he defended the Government during last year's prorogation trial in the Supreme Court, while he once ended up on the wrong side of the law when his penchant for shooting led him to be slapped with a £1,000 fine. So it is perhaps somewhat fitting that the peer has quit his role as a senior adviser in the midst of an almighty row over ministers' proposals to breach international law. As Richard Keen QC, he took on a number of high-profile clients - but Fhima, who stood accused of 270 counts of murder in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial, was perhaps his most daunting. In 1998, the Edinburgh University-educated lawyer had an enviable reputation in insurance litigation but his skills had yet to be tested in a criminal case. He said to have walked away from the chance to defend Fhima would have been ""a matter of regret"" and added: ""I'm pleased that I did just go ahead and do it, and I would have been pleased whatever the outcome had been."" In the end, he helped secure his acquittal.† He also defended David Cameron's former communications director Andy Coulson, who was cleared of committing perjury in 2015. Representing the UK Government in the Supreme Court as advocate general last year as it faced legal challenges over Boris Johnson's plan to prorogue Parliament, he told the panel of 11 justices prorogation was ""forbidden territory, which is a matter between the executive and Parliament"" and MPs ""had the tools"" to change the law if they did not like it. Ultimately, his arguments did not wash with the judges, who ruled that the Government's actions had been unlawful. Lord Keen's hobbies include classic cars, golf and skiing, but his passion for shooting got him into hot water. His 12-gauge shotgun was found left out of its cabinet when police went to his Edinburgh home following reports of a suspected burglary while he was on holiday, and he was fined £1,000 for failing to secure it properly. Ministers had hoped Lord Keen might be persuaded to stay despite tendering his resignation on Wednesday morning.

How Boris Johnson failed to sway Tory rebels over Brexit Bill 'safety net'
",0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson failed to win over rebel Tory MPs on Monday night with the promise of a retrospective vote on any move to amend the Brexit divorce deal. The Prime Minister said new laws to override the EU Withdrawal Agreement would ""never be invoked""ù if a trade agreement was reached with Brussels. But a growing band of Tory rebels, who now include five former cabinet ministers and five other former ministers, said they would press ahead with plans to give Parliament the final say on whether Mr Johnson should have the power to break international law. Sajid Javid, the former chancellor, argued that breaking international law was a ""step that should never be taken lightly""ù and said it was not ""clear""ù why the Government wanted to do so. Mr Johnson opened the debate on the Internal Market Bill - legislation that would give him the power to override parts of the Withdrawal Agreement - by insisting it was merely a ""legal safety net""ù to protect the integrity of the UK if the EU refused to negotiate a trade deal in good faith. In an attempt to reassure wavering Conservative MPs, he said the measures in the Bill to set aside parts of the Brexit deal were an ""insurance policy""ù that would not be necessary if an agreement was reached with Brussels. He accused the EU of going to ""extreme and unreasonable lengths""ù over the Northern Ireland Protocol - contained within the Withdrawal Agreement - which he said could lead to ""blockading food and agriculture transports within our own country""ù. The protocol was designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland by keeping Northern Ireland closely aligned with EU customs rules.

",0.5,Positive,"The European Union can resolve the Brexit row with Britain over the Withdrawal Agreement to prevent the ""ònightmare""ù of no deal, Ireland's foreign minister said on Monday.† Simon Coveney blamed ""hawks in No 10""ù for convincing Boris Johnson to table the Internal Market†Bill, which disapplies treaty provisions on export declarations for goods travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland and subsidy law if there is a no trade deal exit at the end of the year.† The European Commission has warned it breaks international law and jeopardises the trade negotiations with Brussels.†† ""I believe we can solve some of the problems that I understand are there,""ù Mr Coveney said.† The EU and the UK needed to focus on how to surmount the issues without renegotiating the treaty, he said.† ""That's where the focus needs to be now so we can concentrate on the bigger prize which is the basic trade deal that avoids the nightmare scenario for Britain and Ireland, and to a lesser extent the rest of the EU, where by January 1 there is no deal in place.""ù ""I think the British Prime Minister does want a deal, but he has a strange way of going about it,"" he added. No deal would mean WTO terms, which ""essentially means significant tariffs and potentially quotas""ù, Mr Coveney said.†† Leo Varadkar, the deputy prime minister of Ireland, said the negotiating tactic had ""backfired""ù.† ""Countries all around the world, the United States and other countries, are wondering if this is the kind of place we can do any deal with or any treaty with,""ù he said. First Minister Arlene Foster accused the EU of treating Northern Ireland as a ""bargaining chip"" in trade talks between the bloc and the UK Government. She said† striking a free trade agreement would solve the issues with the Northern Irish protocol which was agreed last year.† Brussels warned farmers, businesses and animal welfare campaigners on Friday†that it may be forced to ban all British exports of live animals and animal products to the EU and Northern Ireland.† British cheese, eggs, pork, poultry and lamb would be made illegal in the EU, which would have ""catastrophic implications""ù, the National Farmers Union said, as the RSPCA warned animals could suffer needlessly in long queues at borders.† The EU ban on an animal products trade worth more than £3 billion in 2019 would also apply to Northern Ireland, which, under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement, stays subject to EU animal health rules to prevent a hard Irish border after the Brexit transition period. It would also jeopardise British horse racing by making the travel of racehorses to and from Ireland and France too difficult and force pet owners to send a blood sample to an EU approved lab three months before taking their cat, dog or ferret to the bloc. On Sunday, David Frost, the UK's chief negotiator accused the EU of threatening UK food exports to Northern Ireland during the ongoing trade talks, which Michel Barnier has denied.† European Commission officials, including a member of Mr Barnier's team, told a meeting of trade associations and other stakeholders in Brussels on Friday that the ban was inevitable from January 1 unless the UK gives details of its future animal health and food safety regime.† Unless the UK provides ""full clarity""ù on the future rules and in particular its rules for imports, one EU official told the Telegraph, it would be impossible to add British animals and products to EU Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) lists for non-EU countries.† ""Unless they hear something by the end of October, it seems no animals will be listed - including pets - to enter the 'EU SPS area'† which is the EU and Northern Ireland,""ù a source at the meeting said.† ",0.375,Positive

Planet Normal four months on: if the news is driving you spare - join our rocket of right-thinking listeners
",-0.5,Negative,"Sick of screaming with frustration at the news on the television and radio? You're not alone. Here on Planet Normal, we agree with you - and so do millions of others. We've both written Telegraph columns for many years - with Allison specialising in cultural comment and interviews and Liam†on writing mainly on economics and public policy. From different necks of the journalistic woods, we both hail from unflashy, ordinary backgrounds - and worry that much of the ""media elite""ù is now woefully out-of-touch. That's why, back in May, we launched Planet Normal - a Telegraph podcast offering ""news and views from beyond the bubble""ù. Each week, we board our metaphorical rocket of right-thinking, our capsule of common sense, voyaging to a corner of the news cosmos where ""normal people""ù can think and speak freely. So, no ""gotcha""ù political coverage. None of the mawkish, relentless negativity you get on so much broadcast news. Our weekly Planet Normal podcast, out each Thursday, is packed with straight-talking, down-to-earth discussion between us and our guests. We call out pomposity, lift the lid on what's really happening and have a good†laugh along the way. Starting out, Allison didn't really know what a podcast was. For many of our listeners, too, Planet Normal has marked their maiden voyage into the magical world of digital on-demand listening. We know this because, over the last four months, we've been deluged with emails from first-time podcast listeners - who contact us at planetnormal@telegraph.co.uk. ""I'd never tried a podcast before and - Hallelujah! - finally an antidote to the tedious BBC,""ù writes Jan. ""I only venture into the world of technology when truly motivated - and am so relieved to discover others who think as I do,""ù says Lesley. ""Visiting Planet Normal feels like being part of a resistance movement ≠- and maybe that's what we are""ù. While we hoped Planet Normal might be popular, we've been gobsmacked by how quickly a community of loyal listeners has emerged, from across the UK and beyond. The emails come thick and fast - we read them all and reply personally to as many as we can. As well as each Thursdays podcast, this Planet Normal column will now appear every Monday, developing the discussion we've had during the previous week's voyage in our spacecraft of sanity, while looking forward to the week ahead. The latest Planet Normal episode - titled ""Blighty, Not Frighty""ù ≠- focussed on the government's new ""rule of six""ù, which Boris Johnson confirmed just as we were recording. From Monday, the legal limit on numbers allowed to gather has been cut from thirty - who knew? - to less than seven. But the new rules don't apply to workplaces, shops, pubs or restaurants.

Justice Secretary threatens to quit over Brexit divorce deal
",0.25,Positive,"The Justice Secretary has said he will resign over any ""unacceptable"" breach of international law as Boris Johnson tried to quell a Tory rebellion over his plans to amend the Brexit divorce deal. Robert Buckland said he did not believe the Government would ""get to that point"" where it had to break the Withdrawal Agreement signed with the EU last year, but added that, if it did, ""I know in my mind what I have to do"". As Parliament prepares to debate legislation that would reverse aspects of the EU divorce deal this week, Mr Johnson is facing the growing threat of an attempt to defeat it from his own MPs. The Telegraph has learned that Government whips have begun talks with rebels about a possible compromise that could give Parliament more say in the matter. It came as David Frost, the UK's chief Brexit negotiator, engaged in an extraordinary spat on Twitter with his opposite number, Michel Barnier, in which each accused the other of misleading the public. Downing Street is desperate to maintain a hard line with the EU to strengthen its hand in ongoing trade talks and has dismissed suggestions that it could water down the Internal Market Bill, which unilaterally alters parts of the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated and agreed by Mr Johnson last year. However, Mr Buckland hinted at a possible compromise to come as he said: ""I don't believe we're going to get to that point"" at which an international treaty would be broken. As a Government law officer, Mr Buckland has sworn to uphold the law, putting him in the spotlight after his Cabinet colleague Brandon Lewis admitted last week that the Internal Market Bill does break international law in a ""limited and specific way"" (see video below).

Withdrawing from human rights convention is 'wholly wrong' says Justice Secretary when British Conservatives 'wrote the damn thing'
",0,Neutral,"Opting out of European Convention on Human Rights is ""for the birds""ù, the Justice Secretary has insisted, amid suggestions that the Government is planning to curb the influence of its laws. Robert Buckland said that leaving the convention would be ""wholly wrong"" and claimed that ministers should focus on streamlining domestic laws instead. It comes after The†Telegraph reported that Boris Johnson is preparing to withdraw from major parts of European human rights laws in order to ease migrant deportation cases. However, Mr Buckland said the laws were a ""badge of honour""ù for the UK and underlined ""fundamental rights"". He told Times Radio: ""You know, it was British Conservative lawyers who wrote the damn thing back in 1950. We wrote it because we were leaders of Europe when it came to freedom, we wanted to underline the importance of fundamental rights and freedoms back then and that frankly for me is hugely important. ""And I do think that rather than focusing on the European Convention we should be focusing on our own domestic laws and working out where perhaps we've gold-plated laws a bit too much in what is often an English Law tradition, rather than criticising the convention itself.""ù The Prime Minister's aides and ministers are reportedly drawing up proposals to severely curb the use of human rights laws in areas in which judges have ""overreached"". The plans are understood to include opt-outs from the Human Rights Act, which could prevent many migrants and asylum seekers from using the legislation to avoid deportation and protect British soldiers against claims relating to overseas operations. Dominic Cummings, the Prime Minister's most senior adviser, previously attacked the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg for its judgments blocking the deportation of ""dangerous"" foreign criminals. Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy said the Government should be focusing on beating coronavirus rather than ""giving unattributed briefings designed to distract""ù. He said: ""Any attempt to abandon human rights would make life in Britain less secure and hold our country back on the world stage."" While Liberal Democrat justice spokesperson Wera Hobhouse said the Government's ""attacks on the rule of law must stop"". ""The Human Rights Act does not stop us deporting serious criminals,"" she said. ""Threatening to weaken people's ability to challenge the government just because the courts sometimes rule against you is the act of dictators and despots, not democrats. ""With these plans, Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings are trying to enable the Government to run roughshod over people's rights and allow ministers to break the law with impunity."" The ECHR, and its European Court of Human Rights, are part of a completely different legal system to the EU. The landmark treaty was devised in the wake of the Second World War and is part of the Council of Europe, which has 47 member states including Russia and the UK. The Conservatives' 2019 election manifesto promised a review of the Human Rights Act, saying: ""We will update the Human Rights Act and administrative law to ensure that there is a proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security and effective government.""

Lord Frost and Michel Barnier accuse each other of misleading the public in social media row

Michel Barnier dismissed the Government's claim that the Northern Ireland Protocol could be used to break up the UK and insisted†that†Brussels was not refusing to grant Britain third party status. Instead†he claimed that the EU†wanted to ""know in full what a country's rules are"" before changing its status, saying the ""same objective process applies to all listed countries"". However, the UK's leading official Lord Frost hit back on Twitter by insisting the EU ""knows perfectly well all the details of our food standards rules"" and warned that without third party listing it would become ""automatically illegal"" for Northern Ireland to import food products from mainland Britain. Lord Frost said: ""I am afraid it has also been said to us explicitly in these talks that if we are not listed we will not be able to move food to Northern Ireland. ""The EU's position is that listing is needed for Great Britain only, not Northern Ireland. So if GB were not listed, it would be automatically illegal for NI to import food products from GB.""

How economically significant is the UK-Japan trade deal?
",0.375,Positive,"As the first major†trade deal Britain has negotiated independently of the EU for 47 years, the agreement reached ""in principle""ù with Japan is a political milestone.† Due to the pandemic, it†has been negotiated mostly by video calls since early June, and was interrupted by the resignation of the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe last month. The Department for International Trade (DIT) estimates that as a result of the agreement, the UK economy will grow by 0.07pc in the unspecified ""long term""ù, with trade between the world's third and sixth-largest economies increasing by £15.2bn.† Experts emphasise this is compared to no deal being negotiated with Japan, rather than if the status quo - the EU's deal with Japan - continued. DIT says it has not modelled the latter. After a video call with the Japanese foreign minister Motegi Toshimitsu, Trade Secretary Liz Truss claimed the agreement went ""far beyond the existing EU deal, as it secures new wins for British businesses in our great manufacturing, food and drink, and tech industries""ù.† Proving it can out-negotiate Brussels is clearly a top objective for post-Brexit Britain, but what's the difference between Japan's deals with Britain and the EU? The Ts are yet to be crossed and the Is dotted, with a final accord expected to be signed in October, after which the text will be published. Until then, it is understood that rules of origin, which allow governments to determine where goods have originated from, will stay the same for industrial and agricultural goods but will be better for some items, including clothes and biscuits.† This means even if parts of goods made by UK companies come from elsewhere, the end product will still qualify for preferential tariffs. Overall, more goods will qualify - a win for Britain. However, the deal won't cover British goods with Japanese parts going to the EU because this will be left for the Brexit trade deal. Britain will keep its geographical indications - known as ""GIs""ù - and can add up to 70 more, covering Scotch whisky, Cornish pasties and Jersey royal potatoes, for example. That's 10 times as many as the UK had as part of the EU. Another win. ",0.625,Positive

He emphasises how good the Germans are at owning up to their past failings, not least in how they have moved from a nation practising genocidal racism to one welcoming immigrants and multikulti ideas; but the implication is that we are very bad at owning up to ours. Such relativism is specious - one cannot but look back to the war and reflect that we did not set up extermination camps - and is one of the book's main flaws. One of Kampfner's bogeys is Thatcherism, and he sneers at what Germany has achieved without ""untrammelled""ù free markets. One wonders what Germany might have achieved with them; and he does not examine too closely what might have been different had Germany not put itself at the centre of a protectionist organisation, reaping the benefits of selling to a captive market with what for many of its customers is a seriously overvalued currency. Without weaker economies in its currency union, a German currency would be so strong that its exports would be devastated. Early in the book, Kampfner reflects on the excellence of the German post-war constitution (drawn up, he concedes, by the British) as a basis for the social cohesion to which he also attributes the nation's superiority - a cohesion that is now less than it once was, not least because of Merkel's heavy-handedness. (Kampfner acknowledges the rise of the populist AfD, but stops short of admitting that it might have something to do with Merkel's more radical ideas, implemented without reference to the German public.) Of our constitution, the author says that ""Britain makes it up as it goes along""ù. But making it up we go along - having an unwritten constitution we amend by Acts of Parliament passed by our democratically elected representatives - is one of the luxuries our less turbulent history gives us, and nothing to be ashamed of.

Exclusive: Brexit 50p coins now a collectors' item
",-0.75,Negative,"Where have all the Brexit 50p coins gone? It has been a question†asked for months by many Leaver voters who wanted a piece of history in their wallets. Royal Mint has now produced 10 million of the coins, of which seven million have entered circulation. Yet they appear to be hard to come by in shops and restaurants. Now, the Royal Mint thinks it might have that answer, saying it believes that they are dropping out of circulation because they are ""some of the most coveted by collectors"" who are looking after them at home as a ""keepsake"". There are 1.2 billion 50p coins in circulation and many different designs are produced annually which means Royal Mint is unable to keep track of the popularity of each one. Yet judging by the sales of the commemorative versions of the Brexit 50p - some selling for more than £1,000†- they are proving to be incredibly popular. Royal Mint said that more than 50,000 of the coins - including 3,000 gold coins worth more £1,000 each, and 47,000 solid silver Brexit 50p coins worth £60 each†- have all sold out. A spokesman for Royal Mint said: ""The coins are in circulation. However, we anticipated that they would become some of the most coveted by collectors. ""Due to the historical significance of the UK's decision to leave the EU, we believe many people who encounter a ""òBrexit' 50p will add it to their existing coin collection, or retain it as a keepsake in their family."" Craig Mackinlay, a Conservative MP who first proposed the idea of a 50p coin to mark the UK's exit from the EU to the Treasury, said: ""I have never seen one."" He added that the Royal Mint should produce more of the coins. ",-0.125,Negative

BBC can be the nation's voice after Brexit, says director-general
",0,Neutral,"Britain needs the BBC more than ever to promote the country's ""voice and values""ù after Brexit, Lord Hall will claim on Monday.† In his final speech as director-general, he†will appeal to the government to ""unleash the full global potential of the BBC""ù as the UK forges a new relationship with the world. The BBC needs more taxpayers' money to combat a ""second pandemic""ù of fake news spread by Russia and China, he will claim. During his virtual address at Edinburgh Television Festival, Lord Hall will attempt to set out his legacy as BBC director-general after seven years in the job. Tim Davie, a senior BBC executive, will replace him next month. ""My goal, when I arrived at the BBC, was to double our global audience to reach 500 million people by 2022 - our centenary year,""ù Lord Hall will say. ""With two years to go, we are today reaching 468 million people each week. ""We have plans in place to double that ambition - to reach a global audience of one billion people by the end of the decade. But it needs extra investment from government and that bid is with them right now.""ù A BBC source said Lord Hall was referring to a bid for £100 million in government funding to bolster the World Service in countries including Russia and China. ""This is about much more than protecting integrity in news, critical as that is,""ù Lord Hall will say during a virtual address. ""It's also about helping to protect our democratic integrity, and fostering unity and cohesion. ""The forces of disinformation and social media tend to feed on fracture and drive polarisation. They're often specifically designed to exploit division for commercial or political gain; to unsettle societies or undermine democracy.""ù His intervention comes amid a row with ministers after the BBC decided to force millions of over-75s to pay the licence fee. But Lord Hall urged the government to back the BBC as a diplomatic weapon as the UK seeks new trade after Brexit. He will cite research claiming an ""exceptionally high correlation""ù between countries where people are aware of the BBC and places where people think positively of Britain. ""No one can do more to carry Britain's voice and values to the world. This could hardly be more important as Britain sets out to forge a new relationship with the world, based on an ambitious vision of ""òGlobal Britain',"" he will say. ""Success will mean drawing on all our considerable international assets. And that means unleashing the full global potential of the BBC. ""More and more, in the fake news world, truth is a priceless commodity in our societies. ""So let's not forget that, in the BBC, the UK has a remarkable asset: the pre-eminent provider to the world of facts you can trust.""ù Lord Hall will suggest the BBC has a crucial role play in ""bringing the country together""ù as it battles to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The disease has ""brutally exposed fault lines of deprivation and demography""ù, he will say, adding ""recession may well fan that anger and unfairness still further""ù. In recent years the BBC has been confronted with the the rise of digital streaming services such as Netflix as younger people turn away from traditional television to on-demand shows. Two years ago the corporation admitted that for the first time young people are spending more time watching Netflix than all of its BBC TV services each week. But Lord Hall will claim that he has left the BBC well placed to fight its commercial rivals, with digital services such as iPlayer making up for lost ground. ""History is littered - not just in media, but across many sectors - with companies and organisations that failed to adapt to the digital world. Many great names have fallen,""ù he is expected to say.† ""The BBC isn't one of them. We have made the pivot to a new world. We're all set to compete with the very best in the global digital age.""ù Lord Hall's tenure has been marked by bitter rows with his own female staff over equal pay. Earlier this year the broadcaster Carrie Gracie won a landmark discrimination case against the corporation over claims she had been paid less than her male colleagues. Further legal claims are expected to follow. In his farewell speech, Lord Hall will urge the BBC to put diversity at the heart of its recruitment strategy. ""We need to attract people who are different, who have different ideas about what matters, who draw on different experiences, who come from different backgrounds,""ù he will say.† ""That for me is the argument for greater diversity. It's about creativity - promoting talent to deliver diverse thinking.† And that in turn brings about great programmes that make sense of and reflect the world in which we live. And we have got to be better at that than anyone else.""ù ",0,Neutral

Brussels making Brexit negotiations 'unnecessarily difficult', UK's chief negotiator says

It comes as Mr Frost's EU's counterpart Michel Barnier accused the British Government of ""wasting valuable time""ù in trade talks with the European Union. After the seventh round of Brexit talks ended in deadlock, a senior negotiating official for the UK insisted that ""it's not us that's slowing it down"". The source said: ""The process block now is the EU's insistence that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We're obviously not going to do that. ""We are ready to talk about everything and it's not us that's slowing things down.""ù The official said that EU negotiators were ""still insisting that we must accept arrangements that are rather like the Commons Fisheries Policy""ù. EU negotiators have demanded a status quo deal, which would allow their fleet the same access to UK waters as if Britain was not leaving the CFP, while Britain has demanded a Norway-style fishing deal with annual negotiations on fishing quotas. ""It's in their hands to move to a more realistic position that recognises us as an independent coastal state,""ù the UK source added. The seventh round of free trade negotiations were overshadowed by rows over migration and the rights of British haulage firms to operate inside the EU single market. Road haulage is one policy area that has repeatedly been singled out by the EU's chief Brexit negotiator where the UK is trying to obtain ""single market-like benefits"". ""Why should we give access to our roads to road transport firms, which would not be subject to the same rules in terms of minimum standards and safety?"", Mr Barnier asked.

Legal threat over 'unfair' Brexit deal on customs

In a heated meeting of HM Revenue and Customs's expert customs panel, industry groups said the new Trader Support Service, which will enable the Government†effectively to act as a customs agent on behalf of traders, would destroy businesses that provided customs brokerage services themselves. Last week, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, announced that the TSS would be free at the point of use and operational from September, with the goal of protecting trade flows across the Irish Sea when the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union. However, HMRC clarified on the call that the system would not only help companies complete paperwork for transporting goods to Northern Ireland from the rest of Britain but also from the rest of the world, at an estimated cost of £355m to the Treasury.

David Frost to stay on as Brexit† negotiator if deal not agreed by September, sources say
",0,Neutral,"David Frost, the Prime Minister's chief Brexit negotiator, will oversee talks with the EU even after he takes up his new post as National Security Advisor (NSA) in September. Boris Johnson's Europe advisor is understood to have told colleagues he will stay on if a trade deal has not been agreed with Brussels by the Autumn. His appointment in June was intended to send a signal to the bloc that Britain was willing to walk away if a deal could not be struck over the summer.† A government source said: ""He's said he will stay in charge of the negotiations until they have been completed. He will take up the new post in September but plans to spend 90 per cent of his time on the trade talks if that's what is needed.""ù The revelation will raise concerns that Mr Frost's dual role could leave the UK vulnerable in the event of a terrorist attack. His predecessor, Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, who announced in June he was stepping down as the UK's top civil servant, faced criticism for combining that demanding role with acting as chief advisor to the Prime Minister on national security issues. Theresa May first appointed him as NSA in April 2017 but then also gave him the role of acting Cabinet Secretary in June 2018, while the late Sir Jeremy Heywood took a leave of absence on medical grounds, replacing him upon his retirement in October 2018. When his new role was announced, career diplomat Mr Frost, 55, said the EU talks would ""remain my top single priority until those negotiations have concluded, one way or another.""ù†The talks are due to resume in Brussels on August 17. As well as the promotion, Mr Johnson also gave a life peerage to Mr Frost, who was one of his key advisers as foreign secretary. However, reports soon emerged that his appointment was unpopular with military and security services who felt that Mr Frost was underqualified. Former Cabinet Secretary Gus O'Donnell and former NSA Peter Ricketts also criticised the appointment amid concerns that the civil service's impartiality was being eroded by giving a special adviser the post. Speaking in the House of Commons in June, former Prime Minister Theresa May highlighted the political nature of the appointment and questioned Mr Frost's readiness for the role. She asked Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove: "" Why is the new national security adviser a political appointee with no proven expertise in national security?"" Mr Gove said Mr Frost was highly qualified and would be accountable to the PM, pointing out there were precedents for non civil servants to take on such roles and that the official that oversees senior government appointments agreed this was appropriate in this case. He said Mr Frost would neither be a civil servant nor a special adviser but would have the status of an envoy. Welcoming Mr Frost's appointment, Mr Johnson described him as ""an experienced diplomat, policy thinker, and proven negotiator, with a strong belief in building Britain's place in the world.""ù Crediting him with ""negotiating the deal that finally enabled us to leave the EU in January""ù, he added: ""In his new role I am confident he will make an equal difference to this country's ability to project influence for the better.""ù Mr Frost is coming under mounting pressure from Tory MPs to renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement he struck with the EU last October and which passed through Parliament in January, after a Centre for Brexit Policy report endorsed by former ministers described it as ""seriously flawed""ù and a ""poison pill""ù.

Universities on strike alert after funding drought wilts pensions
",-0.625,Negative,"""òI have lost 22 days of pay striking over this so far. That's how much I care about this,""ù says Dr Alison Cameron, a zoology lecturer at Bangor University. Cameron may have to sacrifice more days yet. Crashing financial markets and rock-bottom interest rates have pushed one of Britain's biggest remaining gold-plated pension schemes to breaking point. The hole in the Universities Superannuation Scheme, which manages the pensions of 460,000 university lecturers, administrators and other staff, opened from £3.6bn at its last full valuation in 2018 to a yawning £20.2bn by the end of June this year. A fresh revaluation of the £74.2bn scheme is due to kick off this month, setting the stage for the latest showdown in a bitter dispute between universities and staff over who should shoulder the rising cost of ensuring future pensions can be paid. The talks begin against a perilous backdrop for British universities. The sector fears an eye-watering hit to the £5.3bn in annual fees paid by overseas students as coronavirus, Brexit and a flare-up of diplomatic tensions with China threaten to cut off a crucial revenue stream. Trust between staff and institutions has been eroded after long-running disputes over pensions, pay and conditions. Rising pension contributions are one of several challenges frustrating academics across the country, feeding a febrile atmosphere. A cull of tenured positions means academics have less job certainty than before. Pensions once based on final salaries are now based only on a career average, massively reducing retirement incomes. A funding squeeze means even minor perks like staff rooms are being removed, grinding down weary staff. ""The only places I can chat to staff without students being around is their offices or my office,""ù says Cameron. Staff pension contributions have jumped from 8pc of salary to 9.6pc and are due to rise to 11pc in October 2021. Together with payments by universities, the total contributions being poured into the USS represent 30.7pc of members' salaries. ",-0.125,Negative

British holidaymakers enjoy one EU perk above all others Äî we must protect it
",-0.25,Negative,"Things have gone very quiet on the Brexit front - travellers and politicians have other things to worry about at the moment, perhaps. But last week I ≠received an email from Carol, a reader whose husband suffers from a long-term illness and she is very preoccupied about Brexit indeed. The illness sometimes requires medical treatment at short notice and she is anxious that they will no longer be able to afford to go on holiday abroad, because the costs of insuring him will be so high.† Her point was that currently they are able to travel in Europe without insurance cover for that specific condition. This is because they can rely on the reciprocal health - or EHIC - ≠arr≠angement, which entitles UK citizens to medical care using the public health system in all EU countries, plus a few other non-EU members such as Switzerland and Norway.† It's an excellent and sensible scheme, and it especially benefits older travellers and those who are at higher risk of needing ≠urgent medical care. I have warned that we may lose it as a result of Brexit but have clung on to the hope that it will be included as part of the final trade deal. The latest signals from Government are not encouraging, however. It is seeming more and more likely that we will end the transition period on Dec 31 without such a deal. A clue lies in a public briefing ≠document published recently (gov.uk/visit-europe) that warns about the likely changes for travellers in several different areas.† These include new arrangements for pet travel (the pet passport scheme is ending and four months' notice will be required under the new system) and stricter requirements for passport validity and for border control. Not only will we have to queue in the slow track when we arrive in an EU country, but we may have to show a return or onward ticket and prove that we have enough money for our stay. The guarantee of free roaming for mobile phones is also ending. The only consolation the Government ≠offers us on this is that we are protected from getting mobile data charges above £45 without our knowing. In other words, once you've spent £45 on data, your roaming will be blocked unless you agree to pay more.† But it is the threat to the EHIC card which, I think, will be the greatest loss to some holidaymakers. Insurers tell me that if the scheme does end, the additional costs for standard travel insurance policies will not be especially high. As Carol points out, however, for ≠anyone with a pre-existing health condition and all those aged over 65, the consequences could be very significant.† For these people, travel insurance, if they can find it, can cost hundreds of pounds. And the option to buy a policy which excludes cover for a specific condition, in the knowledge that emergency treatment is available at no (or low) cost locally, will no longer be ≠viable. Meanwhile, even the healthiest older travellers can expect increases in premiums at 65 and probably every five years after that. Whatever your view of the EU, it is hard not to concede that it has brought many benefits to consumers. The rules which protect our rights to refunds for cancelled holidays and flights, and which also protect our money in the case of a tour operator going out of business all stem from EU directives. Anyone who has gained compensation for a delayed flight can also thank the EU.† These benefits are not currently under threat, thankfully, because they are enshrined in UK law. For all the posturing and politics of the negotiations, surely it is in all our interests to rescue as many benefits as possible from our membership, including the EHIC card. Let's not bite off our own nose to spite the EU's political face.  ",-0.5,Negative

Academic freedom under threat as†pro-Brexit professors face discrimination
",0,Neutral,"Pro-Brexit and right-wing professors face discrimination and are self censoring, a think tank has warned, amid fears that academic freedom is under threat.† The Policy Exchange think tank has released a report claiming that higher education institutions and the Government must do much more to ensure that all lawful speech is protected on university campuses across the country. The paper, entitled Academic freedom in the UK, suggests there is a ""structural discriminatory effect"" against the minority of academics at British universities who identify as being on the right. Researchers warned that: ""Hostile or just uncomfortable attitudes signal to those subject to such discrimination that they should conceal their views and narrow their research questions to conform to prevailing norms, if they wish to progress and enjoy a positive workplace experience,"" it warns. A YouGov poll, of 820 both current and former academics, found more than one in seven said there was a hostile climate towards people with their political beliefs in their department - but the figure is higher among those who identify as being right-leaning, or among those who voted to leave the EU. Just over half of respondents said they would feel comfortable sitting with a colleague who is a Leave supporter at lunch, in a meeting or in the staff room. Meanwhile, more than a third said they would feel comfortable sitting with a colleague who opposes admitting transwomen to women's refuge centres. But more than four in five said they believed academics who were pro-Remain would feel comfortable expressing their views to colleagues, the poll found. The report suggests that right-leaning academics are more likely to choose to ""self-censor"" compared to colleagues who are centrists or on the left. Some pro-Leave social sciences and humanities academics said they had refrained from publishing or airing views in research and teaching for ""fear of consequences"" to their careers, according to the think tank paper. It warns: ""The challenge today is that a serious threat to academic freedom may now, in addition, arise from within universities. ""This internal threat derives from the way that some in the university-both students and faculty members-relate to others on campus, being willing to penalise them on the basis of their perceived or actual political views."" In a foreword to the report, Ruth Smeeth, former Labour MP and chief executive of Index on Censorship, says: ""It does the country no good if our educators, our academics, our scholars and, most importantly, our students feel that they can't speak or engage without fear of retribution."" The report calls on the Government to make it explicit in law that universities have a direct duty to protect academic freedom and freedom of speech. It adds that a ""Director for Academic Freedom"" should be created as part of the Office for Students (OfS) to investigate claims that freedom of speech have been violated, and to promote tolerance for viewpoint diversity in the sector. Universities minister Michelle Donelan said: ""University leaders must do much more to champion freedom of speech, and this Government is committed to bringing forward measures to strengthen free speech and academic freedom, potentially including legislation."" She added: ""It is deeply concerning the extent to which students and academics with mainstream views are being silenced and discriminated against in our universities."" But Jo Grady, general secretary of University and College Union (UCU), dismissed the findings of the think tank's report. She said: ""The idea that academic freedom is under threat is a myth.

Revealed: Spain secretly lobbied US Congress†on getting joint sovereignty over Gibraltar
",0,Neutral,"Spain embarked on a secret lobbying drive to push US congressmen into supporting a plan to strip Britain of sole sovereignty over Gibraltar, The Daily Telegraph can reveal. Seven current and former members of the House of Representatives told this newspaper the Spanish Embassy in Washington DC pushed back after they signed a resolution backing Gibraltar's British status†or visited the territory.† Some congressmen said while diplomats should be allowed to argue their case the attitude of Spanish officials was perceived at times as ""belligerent""ù, ""forceful""ù, ""aggressive""ù and ""over the line""ù. One commented: ""The Spaniards went nuts.""ù One letter seen by this newspaper shows the then Spanish ambassador pushed a plan†just months after the Brexit vote†to end Britain's†sole sovereignty over Gibraltar, instead sharing the territory with Spain.† Under the plan Gibraltar residents would get Spanish as well as British citizenship and Madrid would get equal say in the territory's foreign policy, defence and immigration as London. The Spain-Gibraltar border would also disappear.† Other letters described Gibraltar as a ""colony""ù, dismissed referendums where residents had rejected Spanish rule and made pointed references to Spain's support of America in the fight against the Islamic State.

Ministers said earlier this year that about 50,000 more private sector staff would be needed to meet customs demand when Britain left the single market, although this could be lower if a trade deal was struck. Mr Buchanan said: ""Those people need to be in a position to do the data entry, but everything we're hearing from HMRC is adding to the bureaucracy. It's a serious problem.""ù The Government is expected to release further details of its new border operating model for Northern Ireland on Wednesday. A report by the Institute for Government think-tank concluded that £84m provided by HMRC to help train customs agents on behalf of companies may still not be enough as they fight to process up to 215m new customs declarations a year. Mr Buchanan said: ""At the moment, only companies that are already customs brokers can apply for the funding. That's not a sustainable position. The vast majority of logistics companies specialising in Europe-only road haulage have never needed to do customs themselves. They need to be able to provide a service to their customers which they haven't done since 1992.""ù He said the idea that people made redundant by Covid-19 could be retrained as customs intermediaries by January was ""nonsense on stilts""ù.

British businesses to face mountain of paperwork as post-Brexit border plans unveiled
",0,Neutral,"British businesses will need to submit 215 million more customs forms a year after the Brexit transition period ends, it has emerged.

The process will involve 400 million more annual customs forms for British and European businesses in total. Each form will cost between £15 and £56, HM Revenue & Customs has said. It would therefore cost British businesses as much as £12bn a year to process the additional 215 million customs forms. It is understood inland checks will be conducted at about 10 to 12 sites around Kent, including at Ashford. Michael Gove, the minister for the Cabinet Office, told MPs said the end of the transition period will ""herald changes and significant opportunities""ù which both businesses and individuals need to prepare for.

How travel to Europe will change after Brexit, from passport queues to data roaming charges
",0,Neutral,"With less than six months until the end of the Brexit transition period, Britons are starting to learn more about the new restrictions they will face when travelling to Europe.† Today, the Government will begin an advertising blitz to help Britain prepare for life outside the UK, and†- while uncertainty remains†- for travellers it seems higher costs and more red tape will be unavoidable.† Here is what we know so far about the key areas:† Currently, anyone visiting an EU country only needs a passport that is valid for the proposed duration of their stay. From January 1, however, they will need to have at least six months of validity on their travel documents.† Millions of Britons whose passports are due to expire in the next year are being urged to apply for a new one now, a situation which is likely to cause a stampede of renewals at UK passport offices. The Government is already facing a backlog of applications due to Covid-19 closures.†† Those who do not renew in time will ""not be able to travel to most EU countries""ù as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.†These rules do not apply to travel to Ireland. You can continue to use your passport as long as it's valid for the length of your stay. The Government says tourists will not need a visa for short trips to†EU†countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. ""You'll be able to stay for up to 90 days in any 180-day period,""ù it adds. ""You may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, to work or study, or for†business travel.""ù The European Commission has previously said that, after Brexit, UK passport holders will need to apply for a new ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System)†visa waiver.†This is similar to an American ESTA, will probably cost around £6 and be valid for several years. However, its introduction was recently postponed until 2023.†† Despite this, we may well find - after December 30 - that it takes longer for British citizens to be processed at airports and other immigration points to the EU. The European Tourism Association has estimated that, even under the ETIAS scheme, additional checks could add an extra 90 seconds for each UK passport holder. That would mean in theory that it would take an additional five hours to process a 737 full of British passengers. In practice it seems likely that most airports will bolster immigration staff to reduce delays.  The Government adds: ""At border control, you may need to show a return or onward ticket, that you have enough money for your stay, and you may need to use separate lanes from†EU,†EEA†and Swiss citizens when queueing.""ù Once we are inside the EU of course, we will be free to travel within the Schengen area (which comprises most EU countries) as there are no further border controls.† The highly publicised switch from burgundy passports to blue has also started, with the new documents receiving a mixed reception on social media.† Under the transition arrangements, British passport holders are still entitled to†free or reduced-cost medical treatment in EU countries during 2020. A European Health Insurance Card (EHIC, formerly E111) is proof of this entitlement. The Government had hoped to keep or adopt similar arrangements as part of the final withdrawal arrangements but this now appears unlikely, meaning the cost of travel insurance will probably rise.†   Either way, even during the transition period, it is unwise to rely on an EHIC instead of a proper travel insurance policy, which covers many additional risks and costs.† The EU Travel Directive, which guarantees financial protection against the failure of your holiday operator and which was so important to all those who got stranded or lost their holidays when Thomas Cook collapsed last year, is enshrined in British law. If the Government wanted to water down those protections - which seems unlikely†- it would have to change the law. Meanwhile the remarkably high levels of compensation for delayed or cancelled flights which are covered under another EU directive are also part of UK law. British airlines are likely to lobby hard to get these watered down after we have left. The Government says: ""Some travel insurance policies only cover certain types of disruption. Check your provider's terms and conditions to make sure you have the cover you need if your travel is cancelled or delayed.†Your consumer rights will not change from 1 January 2021. This means that if your travel is cancelled or delayed you may be able to claim a refund or compensation. Check your booking's terms and conditions to find out more.""ù If you want to drive in the EU this year you just need to carry a full UK driving licence. From 2021 you may also need an international driving permit (IDP) to drive in some EU countries. This is obtainable through the Post Office (£5.50). Depending on the final agreement with the EU, if you take your own car abroad from 2021 you may also need to arrange additional cover with your insurer and carry a Green Card to prove that you have done this.† UK mobile users will no longer be automatically entitled to free roaming after December 31. Vodafone, O2 and Three have indicated they will continue to offer it - but we don't know for how long or on what terms. The Government says it will cap automatic data charges at £45 a month for operators that do not continue free roaming. But that doesn't limit the rate at which you will be charged, just the total amount you can be billed automatically. So you could find that you reach the £45 limit rather quickly, then have to decide whether to stop using your phone or pay for more data. Since some restrictions on freedom of work and movement seem inevitable as part of the final withdrawal agreement or in the event of no deal, it is almost certain that British citizens will no longer be able to work in EU countries without a permit. From a travellers' point of view that is most likely to affect young people who might to fund a trip around Europe or learn a language by taking casual jobs, or work a ski season. From 1 January 2021 you will not be able to use the existing pet passport scheme. Instead you'll need to follow a different process, which takes four months. Act before September if you are hoping to take your pet on holiday in 2021. The complex rules prompted the BBC's assistant political editor, Norman Smith, to say: ""Speaking as a dog owner it looks to me frankly such a faff, you are just not going to bother.""ù Speaking on the Today programme, he explained: ""You are going to have to take your pet to the vet to get a rabies vaccination. You'll then have to return a month later to get a blood test, send that blood test to an EU laboratory. Their vet will then send back the ""òOK'. You'll then have to wait another three months before you can go. ""I'm just thinking: pets of Great Britain, you can say farewell to the Dordogne.""ù Current government advice is summarised at†gov.uk/guidance/pet-travel-to-europe-after-brexit. We lost the right to buy duty free when travelling between EU countries in 1999. But we gained the right to bring home virtually unlimited amounts of duty paid goods - such as wine from France, where it is significantly cheaper than in the UK. From 2021 the Government says that we will be able to buy duty-free tobacco and alcohol when travelling to the EU but it is unclear exactly what the allowances will be and whether there will be changes to the duty paid arrangements. Travel between the UK and Ireland is covered not by British membership of the EU but by separate arrangements for the Common Travel Area, which covers the UK, Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. This stands to remain the same even after we leave the EU, the Home Office has said.†  ",0,Neutral

Key parts of Boris Johnson's Withdrawal Agreement amount to 'poison pill', senior Brexiteers warn

The document, which is published as the UK and EU carry out intensive trade negotiations, has been endorsed by a series of senior backbenchers, suggesting Mr Johnson could face resistance in the Commons if he fails to tackle some of their concerns. On Saturday, Mark Francois, the chairman of the influential European Research Group (ERG) of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, said: ""The report argues that the remaining elements of the Withdrawal Agreement after we leave the transition period cannot be allowed to stand as they are, and particularly that there must be no remaining role for the European Court of Justice over any aspect of our national life. That is something that I and my colleagues in the ERG would very much support."" The report, published by the new Centre for Brexit Policy, includes contributions from Lord Trimble, the former first minister of Northern Ireland, Martin Howe, the Brexiteer QC, and Owen Paterson, the former cabinet minister who chairs the think tank. The key elements it says make up the ""poison pill"" include the UK having to remain bound to some state aid laws, the creation of ""burdensome EU customs mechanisms"" at a border in the Irish Sea, a role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for another eight years, and the vast divorce payments, for amounts the report states are ""not owing under international law"" and are ""subject to the determination of the ECJ"". The report states: ""Although the Government sees the revised Withdrawal Agreement (WA) as only transitional until the end of the transition period in December, there remain serious threats to UK sovereignty that will have crippling economic and strategic consequences for years to come if they are not dealt with now. ""Exiting the TP with these threats still in place will not return the UK to a fully sovereign state and is unacceptable.""

Rishi Sunak plans
Brexit tax cuts to save the economy
",0.5,Positive,"Taxes and red tape will be slashed in towns and cities across the country next year, under government†plans†for a post-Brexit and post-coronavirus ≠economic revolution. Rishi†Sunak, the Chancellor, is preparing to introduce sweeping tax cuts and an overhaul of†planning†laws in up to 10 new ""freeports"" within a year of the UK becoming fully independent from the European Union in December,†The Telegraph†can reveal. The disclosure comes as Michael Gove declares the reasons for Brexit are ""stronger than ever"", in a rebuke to Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, who last week said he saw no ""added value"" from leaving the bloc. Writing in The Telegraph, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, also launches ""The UK's new start: let's get going"", a public information campaign to help individuals and businesses to prepare for life outside of the EU's structures and ""seize the opportunities"" of Brexit. Ministers are dramatically stepping up plans for the end of the transition period, with less than six months until the UK leaves the EU's customs union and the single market. In other developments: According to plans seen by The Telegraph, Mr Sunak will open the bidding for towns, cities and regions to become ""freeports"", in his autumn budget later this year, as he attempts to tackle the effects of a recession predicted to be the worst faced by the country in 300 years. He is planning to confirm the successful bids by the spring and introduce sweeping tax and regulatory changes in those areas at next year's budget, including research and development tax credits, generous capital allowances, cuts to stamp duty and business rates, and local relaxations of planning laws. The disclosure comes after the Chancellor unveiled an immediate national stamp duty holiday for six months on properties worth up to £500,000, as part of a package of measures to help the economy recover from the impact of Covid-19. Under the plans, up to 10 UK towns, cities and regions, will be designated as freeports, meaning that they will ultimately be legally outside of the country's customs territory, with goods imported, manufactured or re-exported without incurring national tariffs or import VAT until they enter the rest of the economy. The Government believes the policy can transform ports into ""international hubs"" for manufacturing and innovation, with the economic and regulatory incentives designed to encourage firms to establish new factories and processing sites in the areas. In a second wave of measures, customs duties, import VAT, and national insurance contributions would be cut from April 2022, making the freeports ""fully operational"" within 18 months of the UK's departure from the customs union and single market.

EU accused of risking lives in standoff over coronavirus medicines produced in Britain after Brexit
",0,Neutral,"The European Union has been†accused of risking lives by insisting on slow†checks on vital medicines and potential coronavirus vaccines produced in Britain after Brexit.† Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, has rejected UK calls for mutual regulatory recognition on medicines and medical devices during negotiations on the post-Brexit free trade agreement, which continue next week in Brussels.† British proposals would prevent the need for medicines, devices and any UK produced coronavirus vaccine to be tested twice in the newly separated UK and EU jurisdictions. This†could lead to delays in critical supplies and cost companies hundreds of millions of pounds every year.† Supply delays for medicines are estimated at up to four to six weeks on average but substantially longer, up to four months, for complicated products such as vaccines.† A UK Government official said:†""The UK's proposals on medicines and medical devices would provide significant benefits to patients, industry and regulators in the EU and UK, including by avoiding any new delays to access to medicines.† ""We hope that the EU will engage with the proposal so that we can deliver these mutual benefits, which are particularly important in the current public health context.""ù The EU has agreements on batch testing of medicines with the USA, Switzerland, Japan, Canada, Israel, Australia and New Zealand on public health grounds but has refused to grant the UK similar terms.† ",0,Neutral

Free tuition for EU students to end in Scotland
",0.375,Positive,"Free university education for EU students studying in Scotland will be scrapped after Brexit. Holyrood's higher education minister Richard Lochhead said the Government will end free education for EU citizens starting their studies next year, with the money saved going towards encouraging more Scottish students into university. Students from EU countries - as remains the case for those from within Scotland - have been eligible for free tuition since fees were scrapped. But the Scottish Government will no longer be obliged to cover the cost for students from EU nations after Brexit and it has decided to charge them after that point. Tuition fees in Scotland for overseas students currently range from £9,000 to more than £31,000 per year. Students already in university, or starting this autumn, will continue to be exempt from fees for the duration of their course. In a statement to Parliament, Mr Lochhead said: ""It's with a heavy heart that we have taken a difficult decision to end free education for new EU students from the academic year 2021-2022 onwards, as a direct consequence of Brexit."" Mr Lochhead said the Government will keep the money it saves - estimated to be up to £19 million a year - in the education sector to help more Scots go to university, and to create an ""ambitious scholarship programme to ensure the ancient European nation of Scotland continues to attract significant numbers of European students to study here"". Although Mr Lochhead argued the higher education sector is ""performing wonderfully well"", with the most recent figures suggesting a 16% increase in EU citizens applying to study in Scotland, Scottish Conservative education spokesman Jamie Greene warned universities face ""deep, cutting financial problems"" and an estimated ""black hole of around half a billion pounds"". Scottish Labour education spokesman Iain Gray added: ""It was welcome to hear [Mr Lochhead] pledge to keep the funding previously devoted to fees for EU students in the sector. ""However, the failure to provide any new money to secure the future of colleges and universities was very disappointing. ""While Ucas figures indicate that international student applications are up, it's not good enough for the Scottish Government to cross their fingers and hope that they appear despite all the uncertainties around Covid-19 and a second wave of cases. ""Without a contingency plan for our universities, it leaves yet more uncertainty for the sector."" Professor Andrea Nolan, convener of Universities Scotland, said it is ""reassuring"" the money saved will remain in the sector and provides an opportunity ""to fully-fund the undergraduate education of Scottish students and shift the public funding of degree places on to solid ground for the first time in years"". But she warned: ""A move to international fee status for EU students from 2021 represents a big change to policy and funding at a challenging time for higher education so it will require very careful transition planning to avoid sharp shocks that could further destabilise certain degree programmes or institutions. ""We also need early certainty about how the change affects students from the Republic of Ireland."" † ",1.875,Positive

UK turns down EU coronavirus vaccine scheme

The UK has been for weeks holding talks with Brussels over the EU scheme, which involves using the bloc's collective bargaining power to strike deals with international drugs companies.† With trials underway across the world, there is expected to be fierce global competition to secure supplies when a successful vaccine is found.† The decision not to participate in the scheme is likely to provoke a backlash among opposition MPs, who believe that the Government is reluctant to take part in EU projects after Brexit. Boris Johnson has previously faced criticism in some quarters over the failure to join EU ventilator and PPE procurement schemes, which was initially blamed on a communications problem.† However, Government sources on Thursday told The Telegraph that officials believe signing up to the scheme could delay the rollout of a successful vaccine in the UK by up to six months as negotiations on distribution took place. They added that countries that opted in would also be subject to a so-called ""volume ceiling""ù or cap on the number of doses allocated to each member state.† Although the EU says that ""collective purchasing power""ù will enable participants to drive down costs, officials argue the benefits are ""limited""ù as most pharmaceutical companies are offering the UK similar prices to other countries. Due to the UK no longer being an EU member state, it would also have no say in which companies are involved in negotiations, pricing or the timetable for delivering the vaccine, according to insiders. ""The terms just weren't right for us. The EU scheme wouldn't allow the UK to do anything more than it currently is,""ù one source said.† Another insisted that the decision would ""not damage the efforts""ù being undertaken by the Government's Vaccines Task Force, which is coordinating efforts to research and produce a safe vaccine.† The UK has already secured a bilateral deal with Oxford University and the pharma giant AstraZeneca, as well as Imperial College London to accelerate trials of a vaccine.† The Oxford partnership, which is if successful will mean the UK becoming the first recipient of the vaccine, began phase two of human trials in May.† The Government has also invested up to £93 million in a new Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre, which is currently under construction in Oxford.† When it opens next year, ministers say it will be able to produce enough vaccine doses for the entire UK population in as little six months.

UK given just six weeks to negotiate post-Brexit deal with Japan

Mobile roaming abroad could be free under post-Brexit deals with UK's trade partners
",0,Neutral,"Ministers are exploring plans to scrap mobile roaming charges for travellers to and from the UK's post-Brexit trade partners in a move that could increase pressure on operator profit margins. Under potential treaty measures being considered by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS), people travelling to the US, Australia, New Zealand and Japan could face no extra costs for making calls, sending SMS messages or using mobile data. A Government spokesman said that international mobile roaming may form part of trade negotiations with other countries. DCMS has been researching what impact the measures would have on telecoms providers, who suffered heavy losses after roaming charges for mobile phone users across Europe came to an end in 2017. Stripping roaming fees would likely have adverse effects on the telecoms industry, which makes significant profits from being able to charge additional rates for people using their phones abroad. However, some already offer free roaming in the US, for instance, after striking commercial deals with local operators. Mobile phone companies are already facing pressure on their roaming revenues as international travel grinds to a halt. Vodafone said that roaming in Europe fell by as much as 75pc in April. Discussions about abolishing international roaming charges come as Downing Street races to secure bilateral deals as part of its post-Brexit strategy. The UK kicked off trade talks with Australia and New Zealand last week. Negotiations are also under way with the US and Japan. Recent agreements are understood to have included provisions on international mobile roaming. ",0,Neutral

Brexit breakthrough ahead as negotiators
edge toward deal on easier extradition
",1,Positive,"UK and EU negotiators are edging closer to a Brexit breakthrough that will make it easier to extradite criminals and catch terrorists after the transition period, the Telegraph has learnt.† Britain has rejected EU demands that it commits to remaining part of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which has blocked progress in reaching agreements on intelligence sharing and a new treaty to replace the European Arrest Warrant system. Brussels argues that the commitment is legally necessary before EU countries can surrender wanted criminals or share data from criminal databases.† The ECHR is an international agreement drafted by the Council of Europe and enforced by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The Council of Europe, which includes countries such as Russia and Turkey, is not an EU institution and the UK did not leave it when Brexit happened on January 31.† UK officials told their EU counterparts they would not accept any deal that controlled the implementation of the ECHR†in British law, which would be†unprecedented and one-sided. They insisted the Government had no plans to ditch the human rights law.† The British team offered a termination clause on future police cooperation, which would allow either side to suspend or† cancel any agreement if either party had fears over human rights protection, during the last round of Brexit talks. Negotiators also briefed the EU on British human rights law, during detailed technical talks on extradition, the Europol police agency and the Passenger Name Record directive, which is legislation to help trace travelling terrorists and criminals. They said it was in both sides' interest to strike a deal that protects UK and EU citizens. Boris Johnson's meeting with the three presidents of the†major EU institutions on Monday brought more optimism.

""The British people have never more profoundly disappointed me. It seems so un-British to say, alright then I'll just roll over and I'll stay home.

""I don't think it's helpful to push the minority population to exaggerate their suffering. I think it's important to know where the problems are but this hyperbolic approach of decrying systemic racism in every institution, in the entire country, and everyone in it as corrupt and racist...well first off I don't believe that to be true and second of all that does not admit for any solutions on a practical level."" The interview comes after the publication of Shriver's most recent novel, The Motion of the Body, which satirises the world's growing fanaticism with fitness through the lens of a deranged 60-year-old couple, and from which she read an excerpt on the podcast. The controversial writer, who in 2018 was dropped from the judging panel for Mslexia magazine's writing competition†after she slammed publisher Penguin Random House for its diversity and inclusion policies, told Pearson she doubted she'll ever win another literary prize again, and had even been dropped by her Swedish publisher on account of her politics. ""Fiction writers these days are all from a very narrow political persuasion, their books neatly line up and there's no edge. If nothing else, it's boring,"" she said. ""I have lost friendships because of my political positions. But someone a little right of centre never renounces the left wing friend. It's always the other way around. That means something.

Analysis: Deal is there to be done on the Brexit battleground
",0,Neutral,"It is not in the UK or the EU's interest to admit as much but a Brext trade deal is there to be done.† Both sides continue to insist it is up to the other to compromise on their red lines first, which plays well to their domestic audiences,††but the groundwork is being laid for a free trade agreement to be finalised by October.† Britain and the EU agreed last week to a programme of intensified negotiations of weekly rounds of talks in July. Today's meeting of Boris Johnson with the three EU presidents is expected to end with a call for renewed impetus in the talks.† UK threats of walking away from the negotiations in June if there was insufficient progress in trade talks have proved empty. For all the mutual recrimination in public, negotiators are continuing their work in sewing up the agreement.† The issue of whether or not the UK will ask for an extension to the transition period was put to bed on Friday. Britain will leave transition at the end of this year, with or without a trade deal.† Forget the rhetoric and propaganda. Neither Britain or the EU want to trade on WTO terms and with tariffs, which would be far less lucrative for both sides than the zero tariff, zero quota trade deal on the table.† Both the UK and the EU took up initial negotiating positions that are so maximalist, it leaves negotiators no option but to compromise. The last round of negotiations ended, as all the previous had, scuppered on the rocks of the† major obstacles of fishing rights and the level playing field.† Britain wants a Norway-style fishing deal, separate from the free trade agreement, with annual negotiations over fishing opportunities based on zonal attachment. Zonal attachment is a scientific method that evaluates where fish are.† The EU wants a long term status quo fishing agreement, folded into the free trade agreement and without annual negotiations, with EU boats having access to UK waters under ""existing conditions""ù. Those conditions are in the Common Fisheries Policy, which uses historic catch patterns to divide fishing opportunities..† In the last round, negotiators were due to discuss other factors such as historic pre-EU fishing rights and the economic impact on coastal communities that could be taken into account when calculating fishing opportunities. This would have been a small but significant step forward but EU fishing nations blocked the talks.† Nevertheless Michel Barnier knows the current EU position can't hold and that, deal or no deal, the UK will become an independent coastal state on January 1.† He has called for a balanced agreement but warned a fishing deal is a precondition for a trade deal.† A former fisheries minister, Mr Barnier is well aware of the emotive power of the industry but will also know that it is a relatively small sliver of the EU's economy, as well as the UK's. † ",0,Neutral

Brexit on January 1 'whatever happens', Boris Johnson to insist
",0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson is to warn Ursula von der Leyen that the UK will be ready to become fully independent on January 1, 2021 ""whatever happens"", as he urges the EU to agree a trade deal by the end of the summer. In a video conference on Monday, the Prime Minister is expected to insist that the Government will be willing and able to end the post-Brexit transition period without an agreement with the EU, if Brussels fails to agree terms that ministers can accept. Monday's talks, which UK officials hope will ""push the negotiations forward"", come after Michael Gove gave the EU formal notice that Britain would not request an extension of the transition period beyond the end of the year to buy more time for the talks. The video conference will include Charles Michel, the European Council president, and David Sassoli, the president of the European Parliament, while Mr Johnson will be joined by Mr Gove and David Frost, his chief negotiator. Mr Johnson is expected to call for a speedy conclusion to the negotiations, insisting that businesses and members of the public need certainty by the autumn. The two sides have reached an impasse over fishing rights and the EU's demands for the UK to agree to abide by a ""level playing field"" of rules and standards in perpetuity. Failure to strike a trade deal by the end of the year will mean the UK and EU trading on less lucrative World Trade Organisation terms and with tariffs on goods. †Both sides have now agreed to intensify talks next month, with meetings planned for London and Brussels. On Saturday, a British official also disputed claims by Michael Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, that the UK wanted to enter intensive ""tunnel"" negotiations ""î†Brussels jargon for secret talks carried out under media blackout and without regular briefings of EU ambassadors. But a Government official said: ""The EU was a little slow to agree to an intensified timetable for talks, and has been making noises about so-called tunnels. That's not something we ever wanted and it's welcome that they've now signed up to a sensible process to take the talks forward. ""The High Level Meeting was always envisaged as a moment to push the negotiations forward. We now need to get this resolved and deliver certainty for businesses at home and in the EU as soon as possible. ""There's a high quality FTA to be done, based on the agreements the EU has already reached with other countries. But, whatever happens, we will be ready for January 1, when we will be back in control of our laws, borders and money."" Meanwhile, polling of so-called Red Wall seats in the Midlands and the North found that half of people in those battleground constituencies believe the transition period should end on December 31 or sooner, compared to 42 per cent who said it should be extended.

The UK has refused to commit to never leaving the Convention during the negotiations, which is an EU condition for continued criminal database sharing, but insists it won't leave it. † Brussels also wants judges to refuse extradition requests if they believe they are motivated by the suspect's ""sex, race, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, language, political opinions or sexual orientation""ù.† The EAW replaced bilateral extradition agreements between countries with a much faster system that involved the judiciary directly rather than politicians. It was agreed, with British support, two months after 9/11. Brexiteers later argued that carrying out arrests on the orders of foreign magistrates was an affront to national sovereignty.† The Government's refusal to allow any future role for the European Court of Justice in Britain after Brexit means a replacement extradition system must be agreed before the end of the transition period.† If the deadline isn't met by January 1, the UK will fall back on 1956 rules for extradition which are far slower.† The UK and EU must also finalise a free trade agreement by December 31, unless Downing Street caves on its repeated insistence it won't extend transition, or be forced to trade on less lucrative WTO terms.† ",0.125,Positive

Britain must commit to an upper fishing limit in Brexit talks, Carrie Symonds' NGO demands
",0,Neutral,"Britain must commit to a sustainable fishing limit in†Brexit†talks, the Prime Minister's partner's charity has demanded. Oceana, a Bloomberg-supported†organisation which campaigns for less polluted and overfished oceans, has urged the UK to commit to a Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) in its fisheries deals with the EU so stocks don't collapse. Boris Johnson's fianc√©e†Carrie Symonds, a senior advisor for the NGO, has frequently called for more marine protections and sustainable fishing. When she joined Oceana she said she was excited to ""reform local and industrial fishing"", adding: †""The ocean was seen as an inexhaustible source of fish but 90% of fish stocks are now depleted or exploited. So it's vital we have more marine reserves NOW.""†† The maximum fish limits, set by scientists,†would be agreed by both sides and enable the populations of marine creatures to thrive. The EU already has MSY enshrined in its own laws for the waters of member states, but the British government is said to be concerned that setting fishing limits could be detrimental to economies of towns which rely on angling. Government ministers have argued for an alternative called Zonal Attachment, instead of fixed quota shares.† Under this principle, the EU and UK would attempt to work out what percentage of agreed shared stocks are attached to each of their EEZs. They would then be allocated quotas in line with that percentage.† Given the size of the UK's EEZ, it is thought that this would leave the UK with a much higher quota share than it receives based on the current†""òrelative stability' principle. Conservationists call Zonal Attachment ""a recipe for overfishing"". The access of British boats to EU waters and vice versa is currently being hammered out in talks, expected to be finalised later in summer. Currently, the North Atlantic is 46 per cent overfished, meaning that some stocks are at risk of collapsing. Melissa Moore, senior policy advisor for Oceana, explained: ""If they don't commit to this upper catch limit then really it indicates that the UK wants to continue to overfish, which is quite surprising as they were the ones who fought for it in the EU legislation back in 2013. ""What scientists have done is set a MSY - if we don't have a clear commitment then it is quite worrying. The reason they haven't, we think is there are some fish they are worried they could have impacts on the local community if they bring it into MSY. But if the fish stock collapses you're down to zero quota which would be worse."" The environment secretary, George Eustice has previously said that the UK should set an example for sustainable fishing after†Brexit.† Ms Moore said that Defra's reluctance to set fishing limits shows ""they are not going down that route"", adding: ""This is really one of the first indications - the government has previously said they are going to lead the world in sustainability and not renege on environmental commitments they've made through the EU."" A Defra spokesperson said:†""The UK has long championed the conservation of the marine environment and we are working hard to set a gold standard for sustainable fishing around the world.

End free tuition for EU students to help ease financial crisis, former SNP minister urges
",0.75,Positive,"Free tuition fees for EU students should end from next year to help Scottish universities escape a ""dire""ù financial crisis, a former SNP minister has said. Alex Neil said that it would be ""bizarre""ù for the policy, which is estimated to cost £97 million per year, to continue for new EU students once the legal obligation to fund their places ends with Brexit. Scotland's higher education institutions are currently facing a collective deficit of up to £651m next year, largely due to a large drop in international students caused by†the coronavirus pandemic. The†large tuition costs charged to foreign students from outside Europe are used to subsidise free fees for Scottish and EU students.† However, the Scottish government has refused to set out what its approach will be, and has not ruled out continuing to fund EU students' places on a voluntary basis.† Universities had been expecting a decision in March, but are still waiting. SNP ministers have already committed to paying full course fees for those from the EU, EEA and Switzerland starting later this year, and have previously said they want to ""protect""ù rights currently enjoyed by EU students in future. Mr Neil, who served as a senior cabinet minister in governments run by Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond, said the financial peril facing the sector means the approach must not continue. ""It seems to me it would be rather bizarre to continue to fund new EU students when our own students can't get into our own universities,""ù Mr Neil, the MSP for Airdrie and Shotts, said.† ""There's no doubt at all that given the crisis in funding that every penny is going to be precious over the next three or four years.""ù† He added: ""If the money is going to be used to increase the number of Scottish students going to Scottish universities then clearly I'm in favour of that. ""It might be that over the next couple of years they might need to use some of the money to help with the shortage of funds, which would be perfectly understandable. But ministers need to clarify if that now is the policy. ""I've accepted it was EU law, but I've never accepted the logic that EU students should get preference over every other international student coming to Scotland.""ù Mr Neil, who voted for Brexit, said that up to £10m of the money saved could be used to pay for scholarships for Scottish students to study on the continent, and that his stance should not be seen as in any way ""anti-Europe""ù. The SNP had previously tried to get out of the obligation to fund EU students' fees, but ministers performed a u-turn following the Brexit referendum, instead presenting the funding as a sign of their ""welcoming""ù approach to Europeans. Universities are free to set their own fees for international students from other countries, with some charging well over £30,000 per year for the most prestigious courses. Under a loophole in European law, Scottish universities are able to charge students from the rest of the UK up to £9,250 per year, which has proved another valuable income stream. Scottish universities have said they must be allowed to keep the funding currently allocated to EU students, should the policy end. It has been suggested that the cash could be used to raise the cap on the number of Scottish students, who can find it more difficult to win a place at Scottish universities than those from south of the border, due to the limit on places. However, principals are also demanding that the gulf between what it currently costs them to teach students with a ""òfree' place, and the funding they receive, is closed. The gap currently amounts to £130m per year, Universities Scotland, which represents the country's 19 higher education institutions, †has said. ""Back in March, we were due an imminent decision from the Scottish Government on the fee status of EU national undergraduates starting in 2021/22, after the UK's transition period out of the EU has ended,""ù a Universities Scotland spokeswoman said.† ""It would be enormously helpful to have urgent clarity on this issue given the vast black hole that Covid-19 has opened up in university teaching funding.""ù In 2017-18, the Scottish Government provided around £97 million to universities for teaching EU students, according to Audit Scotland. The number of EU students has fallen since then, and estimates of the cost of providing free tuition to EU students vary. However, it is thought to cost, at the very least, £60m, a sum which could offer a significant boost to universities' finances. The Scottish government said it has yet to make a decision. A spokeswoman said: ""The Scottish Government is committed to supporting EU students, with all those undertaking studies in 2020-21 at a Scottish college or university having their tuition fees paid for the duration of their course. ""We are considering the funding position for future support to EU students commencing studies in 2021-22""ù. ",0.875,Positive

Police drop investigation into Brexit campaigners accused of breaching spending rules

In 2018 the Electoral commission said that Alan Halsall, of Vote Leave, and Darren Grimes, founder of pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave, failed to declare a payment related to the campaign. The watchdog said that BeLeave ""spent more than £675,000 with (Canadian data firm) Aggregate IQ under a common plan with Vote Leave"". This spending took Vote Leave over its £7 million legal spending limit by almost £500,000. Vote Leave paid a £61,000 fine, but denied wrongdoing, while Mr Grimes won an appeal against his £20,000 fine in July. The Commission also referred the pair to the Metropolitan Police but on Friday it was revealed that the investigations had now been dropped.

Celia Mackenzie, chief executive of Whitehaven Harbour, said demand for prawns, usually exported to Spain or Portugal, had plummeted, while demand for whelks, almost totally shipped to China, had only recently begun to recover.† She added: ""Whelks are one of the cheapest fish to land.

The detail will be the subject of future talks and Tuesday's conference will approach the home-grown numbers. The FA wants to use Brexit to ensure young English players gain greater chances in the Premier League to help the England team. The clubs say they spend millions on academies and it is in their interests to promote academy players - but they also want to sign players from around the world. Under the UK's EU membership, clubs could sign any scholar or professional with an EU passport over the age of 16 with no difficulty.

A senior EU official told the Telegraph they will have no choice but to return to the member states and ask them to agree a compromise deal. EU member states, led by France, are likely to strengthen the draft FTA, which exposed deep divides between the two sides, as they did the EU negotiating mandate. ""This draft FTA hasn't got past the French yet,""ù said another diplomat, ""But publishing an FTA that hasn't been negotiated always bears a risk.""ù The UK will not accept the FTA demands for ""uniform implementation""ù of EU state subsidy rules or Brussels's insistence that the European Court of Justice will continue to hand down such competition rulings to British courts after Brexit.† Next week's second round of trade talks are being held by video conference, rather than negotiators coming to London, because of fears over the spread of coronavirus. Britain will also table a draft FTA based on the EU-Canada trade deal next week. It has led to speculation that time for a trade deal will run out, forcing the Government to extend the transition period beyond the end of the year but a spokesman said there would be no delay under any circumstances.† ""Everybody is aware of the timetable and extending the implementation period is not legally possible in the UK,""ù he said, ""It will be possible to complete the talks.""ù ",-0.25,Negative

NFU conference: pay older farmers to retire, says Environment Secretary

The government will phase out £3bn in subsidies from the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) basic payment scheme (BPS) from 2021, and these will be replaced by a ""public money for public goods"" scheme that will see farmers receive payments based on environmental considerations, such as planting trees and maintaining peatland. The CAP has been criticised for creating barriers to entry for newcomers† by rewarding existing farmers for holding on to land, regardless of how productive it is, and discouraging innovation.† Speaking at the National Farmers' Union (NFU) conference in Birmingham, Environment Secretary George Eustice said the Government was considering ""an exit scheme to help older farmers retire with dignity"" by giving them several years' subsidy payments in one lump sum, in order to ""create an opportunity for a new entrant"". He said: ""Sometimes a fresh perspective can make a world of difference: the farmer's son or daughter who leaves the business to work in a different industry for a while and then returns armed with fresh thinking and new knowledge to take things to a new tot level; or those who never had any connection with farming, made a career elsewhere but always yearned to set up their own farming and food business,""†he said.† ""New entrants are the lifeblood of any vibrant industry, and farming is no exception.""

The demand was revealed in Brussels after EU inter-governmental talks and as Michel Barnier†rejected demands by David Frost, the UK's chief negotiator, for a Canada-style trade agreement. British negotiators will reject any role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the future trading relationship, it emerged, opening another rift between the two deeply divided sides ahead of trade talks next month. EU governments have been revising the mandate for the negotiations, which is meant to be finalised on Wednesday. The latest draft, a copy of which was obtained by†The Telegraph, reads: ""The Parties should, consistently with Union rules, address issues relating to the return or restitution of unlawfully removed cultural objects to their countries of origin."" One official said the clause - demanded by Greece, Cyprus, Spain and Italy - was understood to refer to the Marbles, a collection of sculptures, inscriptions and architectural features which originally formed part of the Parthenon†temple and other structures on the Acropolis in Athens. They were acquired by Lord Elgin between 1801 and 1805. ",-1.375,Negative

Boris Johnson to refuse to abide by EU rules on tax and workers' rights
",0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson is preparing to dismiss demands by Brussels for the UK to abide by EU rules on tax and workers' rights after Brexit. Number 10 is understood to object to a raft of stipulations in a draft negotiating mandate submitted to EU leaders by the European Commission - as senior Tories described some demands as ""ridiculous"". The disclosure comes after David Frost, the Prime Minister's Europe adviser, held talks with British officials last week to finalise the UK's negotiating position for trade talks with the EU. Mr Johnson's negotiators are expected to insist that the UK should be given a deal akin to the EU's agreements with†countries such as Canada, Korea and Japan, which they say involve less stringent requirements than those set out in the draft mandate. The EU insists that the UK must agree to a ""level playing field"" in order to guarantee that that the country will not undercut the bloc with Singapore-style low-tax system. But a Conservative source warned that the election had given Mr Johnson a ""strong mandate"" to ""focus on sovereignty"". The clash over a fundamental demand by the EU appears to increase the likelihood that trade negotiations could end without a deal at the end of this year, when the Brexit transition period expires. On Monday evening, David Frost, Mr Johnson's Europe adviser and chief negotiator, is due to give a lecture in Brussels on the EU and the type of relationship the UK is seeking with the bloc after Brexit. † Meanwhile, Liz Truss, the International Trade Secretary, hit out at a US decision to increase tariffs on aircraft parts imported from Europe and the UK, in a trade war over EU subsidies given to Airbus, the aerospace giant. She said: ""The tariffs on aircraft parts announced by the US today are in no one's interest and harmful to both the UK and US. ""I have spoken to my US counterparts, calling on them to engage and reach a negotiated settlement. "" † Mr Johnson is seeking a tariff-free trade agreement with the EUU, but the Commission's draft negotiating mandate makes clear that, because of the UK's ""geographic proximity to the EU"", such a deal would be contingent on guarantees that ""a †level playing field is ensured through robust commitments"". It adds: ""These commitments should prevent distortions of trade and unfair competitive advantages. To that end, the envisaged agreement should uphold the common high standards in the areas of state aid, competition, state-owned enterprises, social and employment standards, environmental standards, climate change, and relevant tax matters. ""In so doing, the agreement should rely on appropriate and relevant Union and international standards."" Mr Johnson's negotiators are expected to resist any suggestion that the UK should be subjected to more stringent requirements than Korea, Japan, and Canada, which all negotiated trade deals with the EU without such sweeping demands for their regulations to remain in line with those of the EU. Ministers will claim that many of the EU's standards fall below the UK's, including rules relating to workers' rights, environmental protections and health and safety. Senior Tories have dismissed as ""ridiculous"" the idea that the UK should comply with EU tax regulations when the country was a founding member of the Global Forum on Tax Transparency and has long enforced its own anti-avoidance rules. Last month Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said he was unable to guarantee ""frictionless"" trade with the EU because of its demands on the need for the UK to align with its rules. He said: ""We want trade to be as frictionless as possible but the EU is clear, you can only have fully frictionless trade if you accept all of their rules, if you accept all their laws, you are subordinate to their judges, you are subordinate to their political structures. ""We voted to be independent. Now, we want to have as close as possible relationship with the EU and the approach that we want to take is built on the relationship that they have with Canada. ""That means that we want to have a relationship where there are ultimately no tariffs, no quotas on our trade but there will be some regulations that will differ in Britain, we will do things in a way which is better for our economy."" A Conservative source said: ""The UK will take a proactive position in the future trade discussions. ""We have a strong mandate to get Brexit done, get a future trade deal and focus on sovereignty.

Driving in Europe after Brexit: why it's bad news for tourists - and even worse news for pets
",-1.5,Negative,"British tourists and travellers currently enjoy unfettered access to the European Union and its 27 member states. But while driving to France and beyond will still be possible after the end of the ""òtransition period', Brexit brings with it new requirements that UK drivers must follow before embarking on a road trip in the EU. These obstacles are far from insurmountable but driving in Europe will become more expensive and complicated than it was before. Most of these changes will come into force at the start of next year; until then, British drivers in the EU will continue to enjoy the same access and protections as they did before Brexit.† An international driving permit (IDP) is essentially a translation of a national driving licence. It enables the holder of a domestic driving licence to drive a car or ride a motorcycle overseas. Until now, British drivers have enjoyed access to all EU and EEA countries, plus Switzerland, without the need for any extra documentation.

The warning was issued to trade organisations as Michael Gove, cabinet office minister, confirmed to business groups that full import controls will be introduced immediately after Brexit. Revealed by The Telegraph last month, the import control plans mark a radical shift from the previous government's ""no-deal""ù planning that prioritised the flow of goods over the need for checks. A source present at the meeting of Border Delivery Group members said the Government had staked out a hardline position that will require all agri-food products to enter via a border inspection post, with identical treatment for imports from the EU and from the rest of the world.

EU member states hardening demands for 'status quo' access to UK fishing grounds after Brexit
",0,Neutral,"EU member states are hardening their demands for ""òstatus quo' access to UK fishing grounds after Brexit, the Telegraph can reveal, as fears grow that fundamental differences on the shape of the future EU-UK relationship could now crash the talks within months. A new draft of the EU's negotiation mandate presented to EU ambassadors over the weekend shows major EU fishing states looking to further tie the hands of the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier to retain their existing fishing quotas. The new text says that Mr Barnier must ""uphold""ù existing reciprocal access to fishing grounds, following complaints from France, Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands that the previous pledge merely to ""build upon""ù existing access was far too weak. EU sources said that the demands on fishing could stiffen even further over the weekend, as fishing states fear that Mr Barnier will make a compromise with Britain that will see their boats able to catch significantly less fish. EU sources from member states with large fishing interests say they have been concerned by Mr Barnier's very careful use of language, talking only of a deal that produces ""stable""ù quota shares, rather than maintaining ""existing""ù shares. Boris Johnson, who is equally under pressure from the UK fishing industry, has also chosen his words carefully, insisting†British fishing grounds are ""first and foremost""ù for UK boats but skirting around any hard guarantees. However the looming fight over fish - British fishermen were promised ""hundreds of thousands of tonnes""ù more quota by Tory fishing ministers after Brexit - could be overshadowed by a more fundamental disagreement over how the new EU-UK relationship will be governed.† ",0,Neutral

Britain boosts fishing patrol force as battle with Brussels looms over EU fishing access to UK waters†

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has hired two extra ships to bolster the Royal Navy Fishery Protection Squadron, which already has four four River-class offshore patrol vessels and one helicopter. The plans, first reported by Politico, will spark fears that upcoming fishing negotiations with the EU will descend into new 'Cod War'; or 'Scallop War' type clashes. Boris Johnson will demand the EU accept a Norway-style fishing deal in upcoming negotiations, The Telegraph can reveal, teeing up a battle with Brussels that risks scuttling upcoming trade talks.† Brussels will fiercely resist British efforts to rip up the current system and replace it with one which allows Britain to restrict EU boats from fishing in UK waters, ensures annual negotiations on stock shares and allows British fisherman to catch more fish. While no final decision has yet been made, The Telegraph understands Britain sees Norway as the best basis for the new agreement.† The EU's arrangements with other non-EU nations such as Iceland and the Faroe Islands, either do not reflect the EU's dependence on UK waters or are not sufficiently tested. The UK has already left the London Convention which grants EU fisherman the right to UK waters and its Fisheries Bill, which came before MPs for scrutiny last month, will require foreign boats to have licences to fish. The European Commission has demanded the status quo is preserved under ""existing conditions' and that EU boats continue to enjoy untrammelled access to UK waters.† Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, warned on Monday that an agreement on fisheries by July 1 was ""inextricably linked""ù to the success of the UK-EU negotiations over a free trade agreement by the end of the year and the Brexit transition period.† A Norway-style agreement would end the dated current EU system for allocating total allowed catches of fish.

EU fishermen take nearly five times as much fish from UK waters than vice-versa.† ""We will no longer be bound by the EU's outdated and unfair method for sharing fishing opportunities.

How the Telegraph's battle for Brexit began in the early 90s†

This newspaper, together with its Daily stablemate, helped save Brexit when it looked like Theresa May might kill it. In the summer of 2018, Mrs May announced a customs union-style plan for future relations with the EU that would've meant Brexit in name only. Leavers were shocked, but No 10 was convinced that they would have no choice but to surrender. The mandarins were so confident that when the Cabinet gathered at Chequers to debate the deal on July 6, ministers were told that if they didn't like it they could resign on the spot - and lose their ministerial car. Business cards in the foyer had the numbers for local cab firms to take them back to London. Brexit-backing MPs were in a bind. Following a disastrous general election, the Government had no majority and Tory Leavers were nervous about bringing down Mrs May and letting a Remain coalition take over. Could it be this deal or no Brexit at all? The Sunday Telegraph, however, held firm. On the morning of July 8, our front page was eviscerating. Its headline read ""Disastrous Brexit Deal Will Cost Tories Power, warn MPs"" and revealed in great detail the fury of the spurned Eurosceptics. The leading article called the plan ""an associate membership of the EU"" and a ""political coup by the establishment"". For many MPs, this was a decisive intervention. So indisputable were the Telegraph's facts, so clear and consistent was its editorial line, that they had to agree with its logic: the deal was a dud. ",0,Neutral

Broadcasters accused of bias against Brexit Day celebrations

That prompted anger within the Conservative party and among Leave supporters, who accused the BBC and other broadcasters of ""òRemainer bias'. Tory sources are furious at the BBC's handling of the evening, claiming it showed an in-built left-wing bias among the corporation's senior managers against Brexit.

""And Sky News has two Remainers outside No 10 reviewing the papers. Quite astonishing.""ù Richard Tice, who was a Brexit Party MEP until Friday, wrote about the coverage: ""This is so appalling it makes us wonder why we bother paying the licence fee. The BBC may not be proud of Britain, but the people are!""ù Many ordinary viewers also voiced their anger at the way the main broadcasters covered the evening's celebrations. Jo Linsey wrote on Twitter: ""After last night, I'm hoping Boris Johnson will sort the BBC out. I didn't just find their agenda to deliberately ignore the leave voters' celebrations and refusal to air the PM's speech annoying. It was frightening. A public service deciding what we should and shouldn't watch.""ù Lesley Thomas, from Ipswich, added: ""I was disgusted at the ITV coverage of their Brexit programme. Instead of showing the sheer joy and jubilation of the crowds of people, they either chatted to dreary guests or gave too much coverage to vegan banquet munching remoaners.""ù† No. 10 insiders maintained they were ""relaxed""ù about the BBC's decision not to run Mr Johnson's address in full, pointing out that it had received a far bigger audience on other outlets. The row looked unlikely to die down after The Telegraph learned that Lee Cain, Downing Street's director of communications, is building his own team of creatives, producers and camera crews to make more videos.

Not, I should clarify, the bonging of Big Ben, which has become such a cause celebre in the last few weeks - but a more keening peal from the belfry of the Cathedral of St Michael and St Gudula, at the core of Brussels.† A medieval masterpiece of a church, it reaches for the sky just behind the 9Central Hotel, where I have been brushing away the cobwebs of a seismic, epoch-sundering Friday night over coffee and a pain au chocolat. In truth, the buildings have little in common. One is a twin-towered delight with roots in the 11th century, its sandstone facade not entirely dissimilar to Notre Dame in Paris; the other is a more modern affair, a boutique property on the busy thoroughfare of Rue des Colonies, with stripped-back plaster and bare brickwork in the bedrooms, and a ""beer of the month""ù in the discreet bar on the ground floor.† But the two do have something in common - a prime location at the heart of Belgium's main city, roughly midway between the postcard-friendly Grand Place, 10 minutes' walk to the west, and the sleeker structures of the European Parliament, a little under a mile away to the south-east. If ever there were a spot from which to gauge whether the capital of the European Union has a hangover this wet Saturday morning - or, at least, a sense of sorrow at the departure of a former companion, then this may be it. Of course, the dial in Brussels has very much been set to ""business as usual""ù for the last 24 hours. In the final minutes of an oddly warm January evening, as the seconds counted down to Britain's exit from the European Union, a small crowd gathered at the shuttered doors of the European Parliament to mark the moment. But the watering holes on the adjacent Place du Luxembourg were lively - young Belgians serenading nothing more than the vapours of the working week, rather than the end of a political era, in the likes of the Vesterbar and Cafe Luxembourg.  It had been the same, earlier in the evening, on the Grand Place - Thursday night's gentle tribute to the UK, a beaming of red, white and blue onto the fronts of the 15th century Town Hall and its same-century companion the Maison du Roi, replaced by the more conventional Friday-night rituals of youthful visitors taking selfies, and older heads chatting at the bars along the perimeter of this vast cobbled space. I ambled through this familiar scene at 8pm, looking for somewhere to eat - and, initially, struggling to find a table. The tourist-focused restaurants in the direct vicinity of the square were full; so too were the more refined options a little further beyond - so many diners crammed into Cafe Georgette that this chic brasserie on Rue de la Fourche had all but sealed itself off from outside view, its windows misted by the congregation of bodies and the heat of the kitchen within. After a little more wandering, I found a compromise - the curiously-named mid-range option Drug Opera, where the menu does not stray too far from the staples of European cuisine, and there are enough seats for several to be readily available at any given juncture. It was what I wanted on a night of change - a dalliance with tradition. And there it was without filter - staff buzzing about in their uniform of black trousers and green waistcoats; a large bowl of onion soup, laden with melted strings of emmental, arriving in front of me with pleasing punctuality. The moules marinieres which followed were mis-sold - but only in the sense that the proffered options of ""petit""ù and ""moyenne""ù suggested some sort of restraint in portion size. I plumped for the latter - ""plump""ù, perhaps, being an appropriate word to apply to the mountain of molluscs that† subsequently appeared, an Everest in a rich cream sauce - with a second, cavernous metal bowl, supplied as a vestibule for the empty shells. Enough to feed a whole family, maybe. The waiter, possibly believing I had over-ordered, returned occasionally to check on the progress of my gluttony. ""You are British?""ù he asked, needing to be no Poirot to detect the accent underpinning my French. ""Is everything OK?""ù Briefly, I weighed and measured the question for a bumpy undertone, a dash of tetchy point-scoring - but there was none. ""All good,""ù I replied, adding that it was a strange, maybe even an awkward, day to be a Briton in Brussels. ""Non, non, non, non""ù came the answer. ""Aucun probleme""ù - accompanied by a smile, so broad in its affability, that it left no capacity for insincerity. But then, Brussels has long been a place where you can enjoy friendly conversations and (should you choose) unpretentious dinner - an uncomplicated city in spite of its image as a nest of tangled bureaucracy. It has never been as chic as its cousin Paris, and would never claim to be so. But it has a certain underplayed beauty; even, or perhaps especially, in winter, when the trees withhold their leaves above its avenues, and the skeletal rattle of their bare branches haunts the Parc de Bruxelles.  It was ""business as usual""ù here too, this morning - joggers plodding around next to the railings of an oasis that is currently bereft of any sort of green overcoat, its ornamental pools empty, the fountains which will tinkle and dance within them in summer held in reserve until the first shoots of spring start to emerge. Perhaps this is why the runners, well insulated against the February chill, were going through their motions with their heads down, finding nothing to see in the drizzled greyness of their surroundings. But to take such a perspective is to ignore the gems on the edge of your vision - Belgium's elegant Royal Palace on the south side of the park, an unreservedly unapologetic neoclassical Versailles fanboy, dating to 1783; the barely less ornate Palace of the Nation (Belgium's parliament) on the park's opposite, northern flank. You might accuse the general tourist of the same shortfall in observation; of the same failure to appreciate what the city has to offer. Although the attractions are definitely here if you look - the Basilique de Sacre Coeur, unquestionably the photogenic equal of its Parisian namesake, on its plinth atop Koekelberg Hill; the Old Masters Museum, with its wealth of works by Bruegel the Elder, Van Dyck and Rubens; the Horta Museum, devoted to the craftsmanship of Belgian architect and Art Nouveau disciple Victor Horta. I will slip through some or all of them this afternoon, before hopping onto an evening Eurostar back into central London - amid, possibly, a little more of the air of gentle uncertainty that floated at the fringes of my departure from St Pancras yesterday morning. In the queue for security, four British women were preparing themselves to board a train that would ultimately take them to Amsterdam after stops in Lille and Rotterdam, as well as Brussels; a train ride ticking off four countries in scarcely much more than three hours. ""What colour will these be when we do this again?""ù asked one of the party, waving her passport at her companions behind her in the line. ""They're going to be blue, aren't they?""ù A frown, a pause. ""I thought you renewed yours last year,""ù one of her friends replied. ""Well yes, I did.""ù ""So why are you even thinking about it, then?""ù Britain and Europe have plenty of thinking to do in the next few months, and in a coming decade built on new arrangements and reimagined relationships. But the rails will still arc under the Channel and up onto the continent - whatever shapes our futures decide to take.

The war may have been won, but the question Brexiteers are now asking themselves is who will win the peace?
",-0.125,Negative,"As the Union flag bunting comes down in Parliament Square this morning, Brexiteers nursing hangovers have reason to be cheerful. The UK is finally out of the EU, and with the remain movement now confined to the history books following Boris Johnson's stonking election victory, Britain's post-Brexit future as a global free trade leader appears assured. Yet having laid down their weapons after winning the referendum in 2016, only to find themselves unarmed against a rebel alliance determined to stop Brexit, Eurosceptics are not waving the white flag quite as enthusiastically as the Government had hoped. The Prime Minister may have honoured his pledge to ""òget Brexit done', but with the negotiations over Britain's future relationship with Brussels only just beginning, it seems the battle lines are once again being drawn. The war may have been won, but the question Brexiteers are now asking themselves is who is going to win the peace? Although a number of Leave-supporting groups may be shutting up shop in light of Mr Johnson's commitment to the regulatory divergence they have been demanding for the past three-and-a-half years, the Brexit movement will continue - in both pressure group and think-tank form. Nigel Farage has already started talking about the Brexit Party morphing into a ""òforum for Brexit', while the Telegraph can reveal that a number of senior Tories have been working with Brexiteers from all parties on well-established plans for a new think-tank devoted to developing a post-Brexit policy agenda. Tentatively named the ""òCentre for Brexit Studies', the think-tank will work with policy experts, researchers and pro-Leave business figures to focus on identifying key areas where policy should change once Britain has fully left the EU after the transition period ends on Dec 31. Other Eurosceptic groups that plan to continue campaigning include Stand Up For Brexit, Briefings for Britain, and Global Vision, a new organisation being set up by trade expert Shanker Singham.

Will house prices fall after Brexit, and where will be the best places to buy?

Boris Johnson's Brexit day speech in full
",0,Neutral,"Tonight we are leaving the European Union. For many people this is an astonishing moment of hope, a moment they thought would never come.†And there are many of course who feel a sense of anxiety and loss. And then of course there is a third group - perhaps the biggest - who had started to worry that the whole political wrangle would never come to an end. I understand all those feelings, and our job as the government - my job - is to bring this country together now and take us forward. And the most important thing to say tonight is that this is not an end but a beginning.†This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act in our great national drama. And yes it is partly about using these new powers - this recaptured sovereignty - to deliver the changes people voted for. Whether that is by controlling immigration or creating freeports or liberating our fishing industry or doing free trade deals, or simply making our laws and rules for the benefit of the people of this country. And of course I think that is the right and healthy and democratic thing to do. Because for all its strengths and for all its admirable qualities, the EU has evolved over 50 years in a direction that no longer suits this country. And that is a judgment that you, the people, have now confirmed at the polls.†Not once but twice. And yet this moment is far bigger than that.†It is not just about some legal extrication. It is potentially a moment of real national renewal and change. This is the dawn of a new era in which we no longer accept that your life chances - your family's life chances - should depend on which part of the country you grow up in.†This is the moment when we really begin to unite and level up. Defeating crime, transforming our NHS, and with better education, with superb technology and with the biggest revival of our infrastructure since the Victorians. We will spread hope and opportunity to every part of the UK. And if we can get this right I believe that with every month that goes by we will grow in confidence, not just at home but abroad, and in our diplomacy, in our fight against climate change, in our campaigns for human rights or female education or free trade. We will rediscover muscles that we have not used for decades, the power of independent thought and action.† Not because we want to detract from anything done by our EU friends - of course not - we want this to be the beginning of a new era of friendly cooperation between the EU and an energetic Britain. A Britain that is simultaneously a great European power and truly global in our range and ambitions And when I look at this country's incredible assets our scientists, our engineers, our world-leading universities, our armed forces, when I look at the potential of this country waiting to be unleashed,†I know that we can turn this opportunity into a stunning success. And whatever the bumps in the road ahead†I know that we will succeed. We have obeyed the people, we have taken back the tools of self-government, now is the time to use those tools to unleash the full potential of this brilliant country and to make better the lives of everyone in every corner of our United Kingdom.

Brexit 'sad' and 'historic warning' to Europe that 'we haven't changed enough', warns Macron
",0,Neutral,"Brexit is a ""historic warning sign""ù for Europe that it must reform deeply, warned President Emmanuel Macron of France, calling Britain's official departure from the EU a sad shock but one that would not dent historic ties between the two nations. In a televised address aired shortly after meeting EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, the French president said: ""This departure is a shock. It's a historic warning sign which must... be heard by all of Europe and make us reflect. ""For the first time in 70 years, a country is leaving the EU.""ù Brexit arose, he said because ""we too often turned Europe into a scapegoat of our own problems""ù but also because ""we haven't changed Europe enough""ù. ""We need Europe more than ever, let's be lucid, faced with China and the United States,""ù†he said. ""I would be lying to you this evening if I said the future of our country lies in less Europe but I'm aware that Europe won't be able to move forward unless we reform it deeply to make it more sovereign, more democratic, closer to our fellow citizens and simpler.""ù The EU requires a clearer ""project""ù, he added, one that makes it more ""powerful and efficient"" so that ""the desire to leave Europe will no longer be the answer to today's difficulties because I think it is the wrong response""ù. The French leader, who has struggled to enact a promise to transform the EU, reiterated claims that the Brexit referendum campaign was mendacious, saying: ""ùWe must always remember where lies can lead our democracies.""ù He sent an upbeat message regarding the ""long history between France and Britain, one made of blood, freedom, courage and battles""ù, saying he would visit the UK soon and seek the ""closest, most solid, most enduring partnership possible""ù. However, looking forward, Mr Macron said that while little would change in the short term ""it won't be the same as the relationship we have had for several decades"". ""You cannot be both in and out.""ù France's interests would come first in the upcoming negotiations on the future relationship between Britain and the EU, added Mr Macron.

Poll: Wafer-thin majority for independence but Scots oppose Nicola Sturgeon demand for referendum this year
",0.125,Positive,"A wafer-thin majority of Scots support independence but they remain opposed to Nicola Sturgeon's plan for another referendum this year, according to a poll published on the eve of Brexit. The YouGov survey found 51 per cent now back breaking up the UK, with 49 per cent opposed, the first time the pollster has recorded a lead for the separatists since 2015. But 56 per cent oppose Ms Sturgeon's plan for a referendum later this year, with only 34 per cent in favour. Boris Johnson has already rejected giving her the legal powers. In a major blow to the First Minister, more Scots also oppose holding a separation vote next year even if the SNP wins an outright majority of seats in the Holyrood election. Scots also still think that separating from the UK - the destination of around 60 per cent of Scottish trade - would damage the economy. The results were published ahead of a keynote speech by Ms Sturgeon in Edinburgh on Friday morning in which she will set out her independence plans following Mr Johnson's rejection. She is not expected to drop her opposition to staging a 'wildcat' referendum, despite intense pressure from some senior SNP figures, and experts have warned a legal challenge to the Prime Minister's refusal would fail.

Utopias, Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, review: this vision of post-Brexit Britain feels like an undergraduate thesis†
",0.125,Positive,"Church bells may not, in the event, be ringing up and down the country, but as Leavers dream of a brave new world for Britain, freed from the shackles of the EU, the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester is marking Brexit Day with a new exhibition called Utopias. It begins with an edition of Thomas More's book Utopia†(1516), about an imaginary island in the New World: the sort of place, one suspects, with which the British government would love to strike a trade deal. Only bitter Remain voters, surely, would point out that More's title derives from the Greek ""ou-topos""ù, meaning ""no place""ù or ""nowhere""ù. More's book sets the tone for what is, in truth, more modest display than well-rounded exhibition. The subject is the historical construction by artists and writers of British identity - cue prints by Hogarth bashing the French, as well as vistas of white cliffs and England's green and pleasant land. The only thing missing is a swelling soundtrack by Elgar. The whole thing, drawn largely from the Whitworth's own collections, has a distinctly literary, ideas-driven feel. There are enough maps in the opening section to fill a floor at Stanfords, but - aside from a sweet, luminous little painting by Samuel Palmer and watercolours by Cotman, Constable, and Turner - not much even half-decent art.

Foreign boats will need licences to fish in British waters after Brexit under new legislation being brought before MPs†
",-0.125,Negative,"Foreign boats will require a licence to fish in British waters after Brexit under new legislation being brought before MPs today.† The Fisheries Bill means EU vessels will have to abide by UK law if they enter UK waters and will end any automatic right the boats formerly held. It will be the first time since 1973 that Britain will have been able to control which fishing vessels enter its waters. The new law also enshrines protections for threatened species, including dolphins, which currently suffer injury and death when they are caught as bycatch by EU-approved supertrawlers. Theresa Villiers, the Environment Secretary, said that the new bill ""takes back control of our waters"" and would enable the UK to create a fishing industry for coastal communities that is sustainable, profitable, while ""securing the long term health of British fisheries""ù. ""Leaving the EU's failed Common Fisheries Policy is one of the most important benefits of Brexit,""ù she said.† ""It means we can create a fairer system which will allow marine habitats to thrive, with new powers to support our fishing sector and conserve our wonderful Blue Belt at home and abroad.""ù The Telegraph understands that Defra ministers also plan to make new laws in order to expel the large nets responsible for this from UK waters. A Defra spokesperson said: ""There is an objective in the Bill to reduce bycatch. The UK is strongly committed to tackling the bycatch of vulnerable species in fisheries and has therefore explicitly referenced this. ""Leaving the EU and Common Fisheries Policy provides an opportunity to introduce new measures to prevent the bycatch of vulnerable species."" The Bill includes powers to stop these ecologically damaging fishing practices because of the UK's ""òmixed fisheries', which have lots of fish stocks swimming together, and where certain fishing practices can have a significant impact on the marine environment. Smaller-scale fishing means that bycatch can be reduced and only the intended fish species is lifted from the water. There was widespread outrage from conservation bodies last year after a ship 14 times the†size of UK fishing boats plundered British waters, despite being banned from Australia after campaigners accused it of causing ecological damage. The boat was complying with EU law. Now, boats which do not meet new British marine conservation laws will not be allowed to fish around our coast, and there are new†plans for every fish stock to be fished at sustainable limits. At the moment, there is no independent bycatch monitoring on many of the EU-approved supertrawlers. Campaigners have said that this means dolphin deaths are not recorded, but the Pelagis Observatory estimates that 11,000 dolphins are killed off the west of France every year. A spokesperson for the Blue Planet Society told The Telegraph that on the South Coast of England, there have been record dolphin deaths, suspected to be because of bycatch. He said: ""Most of these dolphins will have had interactions with fishing vessels but we can't prove it, the only way we can prove it is if we have independent observers on supertrawlers.

What does Boris Johnson's Brexit deal mean for Northern Ireland and trade with the EU?

Here we examine the new deal, and the differences with Theresa May.† Head here to read more on how this Brexit deal will affect UK citizens. The new Irish Protocol seeks to set out not a ""òbackstop' that will fall away when ""òalternative arrangements' can be shown to deliver an invisible border in Ireland, but an entirely new future for Northern Ireland. This will require a complex system of custom declarations for goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, effectively creating ""òred' channels and ""ògreen' channels depending on the type and final destination of the goods. Most significantly, the new protocol also contains a consent mechanism which would allow the Northern Ireland political parties to vote on whether to continue to remain in this specially aligned relationship with the EU.†† ARTICLE 4 - Northern Ireland in UK customs territory ",0,Neutral

How state aid could derail a Brexit deal
",-0.25,Negative,"This was first published in The Telegraph's Refresher newsletter. For more facts and explanation behind the week's biggest political stories,†sign up to the Refresher here†- straight to your inbox every Wednesday afternoon for free. Some have responded with shock that a Conservative Government would consider walking away from a trade deal over the issue of state aid. But as the deadline to agree a deal ticks ever closer, it appears the matter has become the main sticking point in negotiations. The EU is demanding Britain continue to accept rules that prevent the government from subsidising British companies at the expense of EU rivals. A source familiar with the negotiations said that the UK's chief negotiator, Lord Frost, had asked whether to soften the line on state aid, but Boris Johnson appears to be standing firm. So what is going on - has the Prime Minister had a Damascene conversion to Corbynomics? Boiled down, state aid amounts to extra financial support that governments hand out to businesses and industries, which take the form of cheap loans and tax breaks. The idea is to give homegrown corporations an edge over foreign competitors to drive economic growth. Given the inevitable economic struggles ahead in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, it's not hard to see why the issue has become ever more important. The Prime Minister's most senior aide, Dominic Cummings, is understood to believe that freedom on state aid is potentially one of the biggest benefits of Brexit. In particular, James Forsyth, the political editor of The Spectator, claims the Government sees state aid as ""critical if you are going to try and shape markets in technology""ù. There is a feeling that as the US and China use state powers to promote tech innovation, then we should do so too in order to compete. State aid also taps into one of the key ideological drivers of Brexit: sovereignty. Ahead of the latest round of talks this week, Lord Frost said his position derived ""from the fundamentals of being a sovereign state""ù. EU members have been banned from giving companies and industries special help since the treaty of Rome was signed in 1957. This means Governments cannot hand out subsidies ""unless it is justified by reasons of general economic development""ù. However, there are exemptions, with state aid thresholds recently relaxed for ""innovation clusters""ù such as broadband, culture and local infrastructure industries. The pandemic loosened the rules further. In light of the coronavirus, Brussels made it easier for the Government to provide cash injections and other support. Airlines around the world were rescued with offers of multi-billion dollar loans and job support packages. A fact that is no doubt raising eyebrows in Brussels is that as an EU member state, the UK took little advantage of the bloc's state aid flexibility. In 2018 the UK spent just 0.38 per cent of GDP on state aid, compared with 0.79 per cent in France, 1.45 per cent in Germany and 1.55 per cent in Denmark. Mr Johnson's position is at odds with the free-market economics of his prime ministerial predecessor Lady Thatcher, who questioned the government's ability to pick winners among private companies. ""Here we are 30 years out from when Thatcher left office and we have a government contemplating a no-deal final Brexit settlement so that it can subsidise companies and choose national champions,""ù said Tony Travers, a professor at the London School of Economics. In fact, the Prime Minister is more in line with Jeremy Corbyn, who once claimed that the EU's rules ""need to be looked at again, because quite clearly, if you want to regenerate an economy ""¶ then I don't want to be told by somebody else that we can't use state aid in order to be able to develop industry in this country""ù. So the British position is clear, but why is Brussels refusing to budge on state aid? The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has made it clear that Britain's proximity to the EU means it cannot be allowed to acquire a competitive advantage by bolstering key industries such as steel and car manufacturing. In their eyes, state aid is key to the ""level playing field""ù to ensure fair competition between businesses. EU negotiators budged a little on the issue in July, when Mr Barnier suggested the bloc could compromise on its insistence that it retains full control over the UK's state aid policy. ""We need consistency, or some kind of equivalence,""ù Mr Barnier said. Even if UK negotiators manage to get a win on the issue, it is likely there will be internal quarrels as well. This weekend the Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, admitted there was an ""economic debate""ù among ministers about the extent of state intervention. Talk of state aid will, for some, bring back memories of when the UK was the Sick Man of Europe and failing businesses could be bailed out with tax payers' cash. Thatcherism blew that away. Now Boris Johnson wants to unleash a so-called fourth industrial revolution in high tech and artificial intelligence to compete with the US and China. That means risky start-ups that could become the next tech giant being nurtured over time with investment. The EU fears a booming state aid-supported Silicon Island on its Western borders. It could yet be the stumbling block in efforts to sign a free trade deal. ",0,Neutral

Refusal to allow wide-ranging access for British lorries 'will harm EU more than UK'

It comes as a row erupted during the Brexit negotiations in Brussels, dampening expectations of a breakthrough this week. The UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, will tell Brussels that refusal to allow wide-ranging access for British lorries is likely to harm the EU more than the UK, a Government source close to the negotiations said. Europe's economies are struggling to emerge from the coronavirus crisis. ""If this is the outcome, then the intransigence of the EU means that they will be shooting themselves in the foot,"" said Road Haulage Association chief Richard Burnett. ""In terms of market access, the EUs position is far more damaging because of the balance, or imbalance, of trade. Eighty-five per cent of the volume of goods that come into the UK is moved by European hauliers - UK operators are responsible for the movement of only 15 per cent."" The UK wants its truckers to be allowed to make two drop-offs inside an EU member state, and three stops in total in the EU between member states, under industry rules known as ""cabotage"". The Government also wants hauliers to have transit rights when crossing into areas such as Turkey. EU officials argue that the plan is too close to the current arrangement British lorry drivers enjoy. They also want assurance that the UK will agree to ""level-playing field"" rules for the sector, which cover such areas as the working conditions of drivers and technical requirements for vehicles. Road haulage is one policy area that has repeatedly been singled out by the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, as ""single market-like benefits"". ""We are not asking for single market access,"" a Government source said. ""It's worth remembering that EU hauliers carry out seven times more cabotage in the UK than UK hauliers carry out in the EU."" ""It's a silly demand,"" said another UK source. ""If the EU does not give access to UK truckers, the UK won't give the EU truckers access. It pretty much stops all viable trade, as no one will be able to deliver anything."" A spokesman for Mr Barnier declined to comment. Some European governments, led by France, have long argued granting easy access to British lorries would create unfair competition within the bloc. Negotiations over a post-Brexit trade deal have stalled over recent months, leaving both sides just four months to seal an agreement before the transition period ends on December 31. Officials say fishing rights and state aid rules remain the two key sticking points.

""I will continue to push for a good solution, but we should also prepare for a possible no deal scenario,""†Mrs Merkel said in the European Parliament in Brussels. ""Progress in negotiations so far has been slim, to put it diplomatically,"" she said†as she set out plans for Germany's six-month EU presidency.† Mrs Merkel added: ""We've agreed with the United Kingdom to accelerate the pace of talks to reach an agreement by autumn, an agreement that could be ratified by the end of the year."" Mr Johnson has been adamant that he will not allow the discussions to drag on into the autumn, arguing that British businesses and citizens need certainty on the way forward before then. On Tuesday, the Prime Minister told Mrs Merkel that the UK ""would be ready"" to leave the transition period at the end of the year on Australian terms - the Government's preferred expression for leaving without a trade deal. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""On the future relationship, the Prime Minister underlined the UK's commitment to working hard to find an early agreement out of the intensified talks process. ""He also noted that the UK equally would be ready to leave the transition period on Australia terms if an agreement could not in the end be reached."" Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, told MEPs in Brussels: ""We will do our utmost to ensure that an agreement can be reached with the United Kingdom."" Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, is in London for talks this week during a month of intensified negotiations. Last week's round of negotiations in Brussels†broke up a day early with the sides unable to bridge their differences over fishing, the ""level playing field"" guarantees and the future role of the European Court of Justice. Mr Barnier met David Frost, his UK counterpart, for a dinner of halibut in Downing Street on Tuesday night.† He said on Wednesday that he had a ""nice dinner"" and ""useful discussion"" with Mr Frost, and that negotiators were ""working hard for a fair agreement"". In Brussels, Mrs Merkel said the coronavirus pandemic was the greatest challenge the EU†had†ever faced. ""We are all aware that my visit today is coming at a the time when the European Union is facing its greatest challenge, ever. The global pandemic has hit people hard in Europe. Over 100,000 lives have been lost in Europe alone,""ùshe said.† ""Many citizens were not able to visit loved ones because of strict quarantine rules or bid farewell to them as they passed. We†must bear that in mind when we commit to economic recovery.""ù Mrs Merkel said, ""We need to mourn our dead and recognise the pain of farewells that were not possible.""ù EU leaders will meet on July 18-19 for tough talks over a Ç¨750 bn recovery fund and Ç¨1.1 trillion EU budget, which the European Commission has called for to kickstart the economy after the pandemic.† ""Europe will only emerge from the crisis stronger than ever if†we are willing to overcome our differences and identify shared solutions,""ù Mrs Merkel said.

The EU and UK are divided over fishing rights, the future role of the European Court of Justice, Brussels' demands for ""level playing field"" guarantees and the governance of the future relationship treaty.† ""We want a deal but not at any price,"" said Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, during a press conference with Angela Merkel. The German Chancellor, whose country holds the presidency of the EU, warned the bloc needed to be prepared for a no deal exit.† ""Our goal was to get negotiations successfully and quickly on a trajectory to reach an agreement,"" Mr Barnier said. ""However, after four days of discussions, serious divergences remain.""† David Frost, the UK's chief negotiator, said: ""The negotiations have been comprehensive and useful. But they have also underlined the significant differences that still remain between us on a number of important issues."" Mr Barnier said the EU had ""listened carefully"" to Boris Johnson during his meeting with three EU presidents earlier this month.†The Prime Minister said there could be no obligation on the UK to follow EU law, or for the status quo on fisheries or a role for the EU's top court after the end of the transition period on December 31.† ",0,Neutral

Brussels wants the UK to sign up to commitments to not undercut EU standards on tax, state aid, labour rights and the environment.† London argues such guarantees are more stringent than those in the EU's trade deal with Canada and Japan and that they could restrict the UK's ability to diverge from Brussels rules after the end of the transition period on January 1.† ""The level playing field is not for sale,""ù†Mr Barnier said at the European Policy Centre think tank in Brussels after speculation the deadlock could be broken if the UK accepted some tariffs in return for looser commitments.†† ""Even if you were to maintain tariffs on some goods [...]the EU will still demand strong level playing field guarantees. It is a core part of our modern trade policy and we refuse to compromise our values to benefit the British economy.""ù ""Next week we are ready to work on operational and clever compromises but not at the price, never at the price, of any unravelling of the Single Market,""ù Mr Barnier added.† He admitted the coronavirus pandemic had slowed negotiations but blamed†Brexiteers for blocking progress in the talks. ""We have the Brexiteers and a good part of the Tory party keeping a very hard line on full sovereignty for the UK [...] and no concessions even if it means no deal,""ù he said.† Fishing is the other major obstacle to striking a deal before the no deal deadline of the end of the year. The EU wants a status quo agreement, while the UK wants annual negotiations on access to water based on a new system of calculating fish shares.† Mr Barnier said that EU member states had made† a fisheries agreement a condition for any trade deal. If both sides did not compromise, then there would be no fisheries or trade agreement.† ""That is the reality,""ù he said.† He said he and the European Commission's fisheries department were willing to work on ""the mix of parameters""ù to find a compromise during next month's talks.† He repeated his accusation that the UK was trying to ""cherry-pick""ù the advantages of EU membership, despite having left the bloc.† Mr Barnier said the EU would not agree to allow Britain to make cars from parts around the world before exporting them, tariff-free, to the EU as British. About 80% of UK car parts are sourced from the EU.† ""Nothing would justify us encouraging UK manufacturers to start sourcing their parts outside of the EU, nothing would justify us signing away tens of thousands of European jobs for the UK's benefit,""ù he said.† Mr Barnier said that the UK and EU were ""not far""ù from an agreement on continued police and judicial cooperation†such as intelligence sharing and extradition after the end of the Brexit transition period.† ",0,Neutral

European Parliament warns EU tariffs will hit British farmers first
",0,Neutral,"Beef†and lamb will be among the products†targeted first by EU tariffs if the UK refuses to stick to a level playing field guaranteed†in a trade deal with Brussels, the European Parliament has said. The warning to the nation's farmers emerged as France's Europe Minister said on Friday that Britain couldn't afford a no-trade deal exit because of the economic impact of coronavirus. ""Those who need the deal the most are the British, they cannot withstand a second shock after the epidemic,""ù Am√©lie de Montchalin said, ""they won't have access to the safety net of Europe""ù. The level playing field guarantees are a major obstacle to agreeing a UK-EU trade deal before the end of the transition period at the end of the year.† Reports have fuelled speculation that the two sides could agree that the UK could reserve the right to walk away from the commitments but only at the price of EU tariffs on its imports.† A European Parliament report, passed on Thursday by a large majority, said any EU tariffs would target agricultural† products such as Welsh lamb.† It ""highlights that agricultural goods would probably be most affected""ù as well as calling for any breach of a future fishing agreement to be punished with tariffs.† ""Farmers in the EU and UK rely on trade to support their businesses. The EU takes more than 70 per cent†of the UK's agri-food exports, and it is essential this relationship is maintained through a zero tariff, zero quota agreement,""ù said National Farmers Union President Minette Batters. Michael Gove has suggested to Brussels that Britain could accept some tariffs in order to have the freedom to diverge, moving away from the goal of a zero tariff trade deal. That was ruled out by Michel Barnier who said there was not enough time before the end of the transition period to do a line by line negotiation. The European Commission wants level playing field guarantees to prevent the UK undercutting EU standards on tax, labour rights, state aid and the environment to get an unfair competitive advantage.† Britain rejects the demand because the guarantees are more stringent than those in EU trade deals with Canada and Japan and the Government fears they could restrict the ability to diverge from EU rules.† ",-0.25,Negative

With EU leaders distracted by the coronavirus crisis, diplomatic sources said a breakthrough was more likely to come in October, which would give MEPs time to ratify the deal, but admit the real deadline is one minute to midnight on New Year's Eve. Mr Johnson said: ""I certainly don't want to see this going on into the Autumn and Winter as perhaps in Brussels they would like. I don't see any point in that so lets get it done.""

Britain not ready for full border controls on EU imports until six months after Brexit transition period, Government admits
",0,Neutral,"Britain will not be ready to impose full border controls on imported EU goods for at least six months after the Brexit transition period, the Government admitted on Friday. The humiliating climbdown was made as Michael Gove gave the EU formal notice that there would be no British request to extend the transition period beyond the end of the year to buy more time for deadlocked trade negotiations.† Businesses importing EU goods must keep records of what tariffs they should pay from January 1 next year but will not have to pay them until July. EU member states such as France and the Netherlands are expected to fully enforce their own customs code and border controls.† The Government blamed the coronavirus pandemic for the need for the light-touch regime which will see controls gradually increase over time. Logistics businesses welcomed the move as pragmatic.† The backtracking on promises to enforce full border controls on the EU emerged on the same day that Mr Gove held video talks with the European Commission in the joint committee on the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement.† The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster ""couldn't be clearer"" in his formal notice to the commission, Maros Sefcovic, a commission vice-president,†told reporters in Brussels.

Britain accuses the EU of trying to string Brexit talks out until the November deadline
",-0.125,Negative,"Britain has accused the EU of wanting to string out Brexit trade talks until the November deadline for an agreement in the hope of making the UK cave in to its demands. With the latest round of negotiations beginning on Tuesday, Boris Johnson wants to up the pace of the talks after making it clear that he will not extend the transition period and will not budge on sovereignty issues such as fishing rights. Ministers are anxious to ensure that businesses have as much time as possible to prepare for whatever trading regime is in place when the UK's current arrangements come to an end on December 31. Their aim is to make significant progress before Mr Johnson holds a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in July, at which the Prime Minister will formally reject an offer of an extension. But there are fears that EU leaders think that by running down the clock Britain will fold at the last minute. Mr Johnson has made clear he will not blink and is prepared to leave the EU without a trade deal if necessary. A trade deal must be negotiated, translated and presented to the European Parliament by November 26 in order for it to be ratified by the end of the year. The date coincides with MEPs' penultimate plenary session of the year in Strasbourg, with the final one in mid-December coming too late to sign off any deal with the UK. A UK source close to the negotiations said: ""We expect next week's round to be constructive and keep the process on track. But then we are going to need things to move forward faster. ""We recognise the EU have other important issues on their plate too, as we all do, but they can't just mark time on these talks. ""The EU seems to have finally understood we aren't going to move on fundamentals, so they now need to think quickly about how they can find an agreement that reflects this reality."" Until now, the talks have been deadlocked over issues including fishing rights, with the EU insisting its members must maintain similar access to British waters as they currently do, and Mr Johnson stating baldly that it will be up to Britain who fishes in its waters from Jan 1.

BBC to focus more on Brexit-voting towns in overhaul of local news
",0.125,Positive,"The BBC is to refocus its news programmes on towns and cities that voted Leave, after admitting it ""under-served""ù them during the EU referendum. The corporation will overhaul its regional news output and give more time to voices from the Midlands and the North of England, answering critics who have accused it of representing a metropolitan elite. In its annual plan, the BBC singled out Bradford, Sunderland, Wolverhampton, Blackpool and Peterborough. Bradford voted 54.2 per cent to leave the EU and the others voted at least 60 per cent in favour. The move comes two months after the Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, said the BBC had failed to understand the strength of pro-Brexit feeling and had provided a ""narrow urban outlook""ù in its news reporting. John Humphrys, the former presenter of Radio 4's Today programme, has said the referendum result took the BBC by surprise because the corporation was so out of touch with ordinary people. The plan states: ""We need to build around a definition of ""òlocal' determined by audience need and by a focus on an audience that is less well served by the BBC's current network portfolio. ""This is likely to involve a greater emphasis on serving audiences in the Midlands and North of England better, including focusing on areas the BBC has traditionally served less well, such as Bradford, Sunderland, Wolverhampton, Blackpool and Peterborough.""ù The change of approach is part of wider changes in the BBC's local news services in England, which are to undergo a ""profound transformation""ù amid budget cuts. ""Our current local strategy in England was effectively created in the 1960s and 1970s when local radio and regional TV transmitters set the pattern for how the BBC thinks about local and regional audiences and editorial output. But while little has changed in the BBC's editorial offer or geographical targeting, audiences have changed,""ù it said. Elsewhere in the plan, it was confirmed that BBC Four is to be downgraded to a repeats channel, with original arts programming and documentaries being squeezed into BBC Two. BBC Four could also become the first BBC channel available to foreign audiences, with plans under way to turn it into a subscription channel outside the UK as the corporation looks for new ways to generate commercial income.

Stilton cheese cannot be made in Cambridge village of same name because of 'EU bureaucracy'

Mr Vara is campaigning for the historic village of Stilton to be able to manufacture the world famous cheese, saying it will benefit local jobs and tourism.

However, Matthew O'Callaghan, chairman of the UK Protected Food Names Association, said it was the High Court of England in 1966 that restricted its production to the three English counties, ruling in favour of granting a trademark to the Stilton Cheese Makers Association.

Boris Johnson: I'll walk away from trade talks if EU tries to bind us to their rules

With negotiations over a trade deal due to start in a month, Mr Johnson and Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, made their opening gambits and exposed a chasm between what the two sides want. Mr Barnier said Britain must align with rules and regulations laid down in Brussels if it wants tariff-free, quota-free access to the EU single market, and must accept some European Court of Justice oversight in future - something Mr Johnson has categorically ruled out.

Then sterling clawed back its losses, rising to be up 0.4pc against the dollar at $1.2978, after a Financial Times reporter tweeted that officials in London saw the chance of a deal having risen from 30pc to 70pc. However, it sank again after an EU official was reported as saying there were ""no landing zones""ù yet in trade talks with Brussels.† ""It does seem like there are tentative signs of ""òprogress' despite all the chuntering around the Internal Market Bill, which looks increasingly like a sideshow to the main event of trade talks,""ù Neil Wilson of Markets.com said.

Lord Frost insists EU needs to work on more realistic policy positions on Brexit

Five ways businesses can prepare for Brexit
",0,Neutral,"With fewer than 100 days until the UK leaves the single market and customs union, business leaders up and down supply chains must concentrate on preparedness for Brexit. That was Michael Gove's†message†to industry groups in a leaked letter seen by The Telegraph†on Tuesday. Otherwise, the Cabinet Secretary warns, in a ""reasonable worst-case scenario""ù about 7,000 port-bound trucks in Kent could find themselves in two-day delays - or worse if there is†a winter spike in Covid-19, meaning†border staff are off sick. ""It is essential that traders act now and get ready for new formalities,""ù Mr Gove urged. While staying afloat amid the Covid†crisis has been the top priority for most firms, they also say unanswered questions - on issues such as rules of origin, the labelling of food and drink to be sold in the EU and Northern Ireland and goods moving west from Britain to Northern Ireland - are holding back their plans. So with the information available now, what can businesses do to prevent disruption and make a success of Brexit on Jan†1? To move goods into and out of the EU, from Jan†1 firms will need an economic operators registration and identification (EORI) number, and all goods imported to the UK will be subject to UK global tariffs, in addition to other new tariffs if there is no Brexit trade deal -†and possibly others even if there is an agreement. New duty rules will also apply to goods bound for the rest of the world that face EU-negotiated tariffs, although many of these have yet to be agreed. Sarah Gunton, commercial partner at Harper James solicitors, advises that firms should keep track of new foreign tariffs that may apply to their goods, review their commercial contracts to check how Brexit will affect them, consider hiring a customs agent to fill out customs declarations, and check whether they need to register for VAT in EU countries they work in. Companies should ask their suppliers if†they are stockpiling to cover potential border delays and check whether anyone in their supply chain will be raising prices to cover Brexit costs. ""Where any links in the supply chain are found to be ill-prepared for Brexit, look for alternate suppliers,""ù Gunton says. From Jan 1, a new points-based system for sponsored workers will come into effect, covering both EU and non-EU migrants. UK-based workers who are citizens of the EU, the European Economic Area or Switzerland will need to register for settled status to remain living in the UK six months after the end of the transition period. Firms should check their staff can continue to live and work legally post-Brexit - in the UK and the EU. Gunton advises that it is especially important that companies needing to replace staff with particular skill sets, such as in consultancy services and computing, should be recruited in plenty of time.

Five stocks that will benefit if there's a no-deal Brexit
",0,Neutral,"The risk of a no-deal Brexit†came back with a bang earlier this month and investors need to plan ahead to get their portfolio ready. Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a deadline to get a trade deal done with the EU by October 15 despite the two sides seemingly far apart. The†effects of political decisions can†cause swings in†financial markets. Picking stocks that can weather uncertainty that the new deadline will bring is likely to be difficult, but crucial. Since the referendum in 2016, shares that rely heavily on the British economy have significantly lagged behind the wider world. A main reasons for this was the pound weakened against other currencies meaning international firms benefitted from a boost to revenues. Chris Beckett, at wealth manager Quilter Cheviot, said: ""We fully expect that the pound would weaken†again [in a no-deal scenario] and as companies with strong international earnings stand to benefit."" The key for investors if†a deal was not reached would be to buy businesses that generate the majority of their earnings from overseas. One company is Diageo, the world's largest alcoholic beverages†company. Despite being listed in Britain, its most profitable market is America, accounting for 40pc of sales last year. It has large market share for whisky (23pc) and gin (5pc) that are predominantly manufactured in Britain and sold globally.†A fall in the pound therefore would make goods exported from Britain cheaper to the rest of the world and in theory should increase demand. Sam Dickens, at stockbroker IG backed the dollar-earner theory. He said: ""One stock that has repeatedly shrugged off Brexit concerns is consumer goods giant Reckitt Benckiser.""ù The firm behind brands such as Dettol and Nurofen has grown its sales by an average 5.2pc per year over the past decade whilst maintaining a healthy profit margin. Crucially, just 13.5pc of revenue was generated in Britain last year†with the majority from America. A†weaker pound-to-dollar exchange rate would see these sales translated back into pounds at a more attractive rate, boosting revenue, he said. ",1.5,Positive

Lord Keen resigns over Boris Johnson's Internal Market Bill
",0,Neutral,"Lord Keen, the Scottish advocate general and justice minister, has resigned over the Internal Market Bill, which would allow the Government to break international law. The lawyer was finding it ""increasingly difficult"" to reconcile Mr Johnson's bill with the law, the BBC reported. Although his resignation was offered on Wednesday morning, Downing Street took until 5.30pm to confirm it had been accepted. Asked at Wednesday afternoon's Liaison Committee whether Lord Keen had resigned, Mr Johnson said: ""As far as I know, conversations on that matter are still continuing."" It was later confimed by No10. Lord Keen rose to prominence when he defended Mr Johnson in the Supreme Court last year when the triggering of Article 50 was challenged by campaigners. He†became the spokesperson for Ministry of Justice business in the House of Lords in July 2016. The news comes after Lord Keen said Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland Secretary, had misspoken when he said the UK was willing to break international law ""in a limited and specific way"". Mr Lewis told MPs the justice minister had been wrong to dispute his statement, which he said had been signed off by the Government's law officers. Labour said that Lord Keen's authority was ""shot""ù because of the apparent division between him and other ministers. Tory backbenchers have already rebelled over the bill, which breaks parts of the Withdrawal Agreement with the European Union signed earlier this year. Former Cabinet ministers including Theresa May and Sajid Javid have opposed the bill, alongside former attorneys general Geoffrey Cox and Jeremy Wright. Qualified lawyers in the Commons and Lords are said to be reluctant to support the bill in case it prevents them from practicing law after leaving politics.

UK could surrender control over Channel Islands' fishing in bid to pass Brexit deal
",0,Neutral,"Britain could surrender control over fishing waters around the Channel Islands in an attempt to resolve a key dispute in Brexit negotiations with the European Union, it has been claimed. The EU has floated the possibility of instating different fishing rights around the Channel Islands to those around the UK, allowing more access for French and Dutch vessels, the Telegraph understands. The proposal would likely involve less EU access to the Channel Islands' waters than it currently has, but more than if Britain had sole control. Government sources on Wednesday insisted there would be ""no departure from our fundamental position that we will have control of our waters around there [the Channel Islands]."" Jersey and Guernsey are not part of the United Kingdom, although defence of the islands and most foreign relations are handled by the British Government.

Letters: The PM is standing up to Brussels - and MPs should stand behind him
",0,Neutral,"SIR - After four years of Britain caving in to EU demands following the Brexit vote, it is uplifting to see a change in strategy and attitude under this Government. Unlike his predecessor, Boris Johnson has taken Brexit seriously. He is determined to deliver what we voted for: a clean break from the EU. If Brussels is content with its current trading terms with Canada, why can't we have the same? The EU has tried its best to humiliate Britain since the referendum, and to turn us into a satellite state. It is now vitally important that MPs support our Prime Minister in passing the Internal Market Bill to protect our sovereignty. If this happens, the EU will have no cards left - and the referendum result can be honoured. Dr Alistair A Donald
Watlington, Oxfordshire † SIR - I voted Remain in the referendum, but I believe that we should all be supporting the Prime Minister in his efforts to uphold the integrity of our country. For the EU to impose tariffs or restrictions on goods or services between London and Londonderry would be ridiculous.

Tory MPs urge Boris Johnson to use Brexit to impose tougher sanctions on Iran

Likening the nuclear deal Brussels signed with Iran to ""appeasement"", they claim ""the erratic and provocative conduct of Tehran"" is justification for Britain to take a tougher stance like the US. Former Brexit minister David Jones and Bob Blackman, the executive secretary of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, are leading the calls amid growing concerns over human rights abuses by Tehran's totalitarian regime. Writing for The Telegraph, Mr Jones, a former Welsh Secretary, said: ""While still a member of the EU, Britain helped to negotiate the nuclear deal with Iran, which resulted in the suspension of all United Nations sanctions on the Islamist regime. ""Despite the erratic and provocative conduct of Tehran since the deal was concluded, Britain has, with the other European powers, continued to support it. ""Sadly, this has been the case for decades where policy on Iran is concerned. Even before the nuclear deal, Europe has generally pursued conciliation and arguably outright appeasement, to the extent of† even overlooking vile crimes against humanity in order to avoid undermining relations with the Islamic Republic. ""Why is the UK continuing to support EU foreign policy when we have already relinquished our membership of the club? Why are we standing by while Iran continues to demonstrate an undiminished commitment to malign activities, including aggressive regional destabilisation in the Middle East and the development and testing of ballistic missiles that could one day carry a nuclear warhead?"" Supporting US President Donald Trump's decision not to recognise the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran, he added: ""The White House has been urging its closest allies to apply 'maximum pressure' to the Islamic Republic.

Calls for all fishermen to land catch in UK
",-0.5,Negative,"A win†in the Brexit trade talks on fisheries would be meaningless without new legislation to encourage fishermen to land their catches in the UK, according to the British Ports Association. Richard Ballantyne, chief executive of the BPA, said unless more fish was caught and landed in UK - even if by EU vessels - deprived coastal communities that depend on businesses offering services such as processing and packaging would not benefit, undermining government policies such as free ports and levelling up that are aimed at reducing regional inequality. The BPA estimates that every £1m of seafood landed in the UK creates up to 76 jobs in the wider economy. However, it claims that 40pc of the UK's seafood quota is currently landed abroad. In 2017, £260m of the UK quota was landed elsewhere, which could have supported 20,000 jobs, the BPA said. Meanwhile, £850m of seafood was caught by foreign boats in UK waters in 2016. The BPA said if Britain ""took full control of its waters as an independent coastal state""ù, this extra quota would create 60,000 jobs if landed in the UK, even if it was caught by foreign vessels. A survey of fishing ports by the BPA found 40pc did not consider their current income sufficient to meet their long-term needs. Currently, under the ""economic link""ù conditions of UK fishing licenses, at least half of landings must be made at UK ports and half of crews must be UK residents. The BPA wants the Fisheries Bill, which will enter the committee stage in the House of Commons tomorrow, to make it mandatory for as close to all of the fish caught in UK waters to be landed in UK ports.

Boris Johnson set to opt out of human rights laws
",0.125,Positive,"Britain is preparing to opt out of major parts of European human rights laws, risking an explosive new row with the EU. Boris Johnson's aides and ministers are drawing up proposals to severely curb the use of human rights laws in areas in which judges have ""overreached"". The plans under discussion include opt-outs from the Human Rights Act, which could prevent many migrants and asylum seekers from using the legislation to avoid deportation and protect British soldiers against claims relating to overseas operations.†The Act allows British courts to apply the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The move sets up a major new confrontation with the EU, which has been demanding that the UK commits to remaining signed up to the ECHR and keep the Human Rights Act in place as the price of future ""law enforcement co-operation"" between the bloc and Britain.

He†also believes the UK will still ""prosper mightily"" under a narrower, Australia-style trade deal.

How a no-deal Brexit will affect travel bookings, currency exchange and insurance
",0.125,Positive,"Travellers may be facing further disruption come January when Britain's transition period leaving the European Union comes to an end.† Until then Britons travelling abroad will continue to have the same rights and benefits as when the country was still part of the bloc. What happens after that will depend on what kind of agreement - if any - is reached between the two sides.†Ministers had hoped to come up with a deal by now but, as coronavirus continues to wreak havoc, a disorderly exit†is looking increasingly likely.† So what will the departure mean for your travel plans? Even in a no-deal the British government has suggested that flights, ferries and rail services will continue to operate and you won't immediately need a visa to travel to the EU - however this is far from guaranteed.† Sarah Coles of stock broker Hargreaves Lansdown said: ""The longer we wait for an agreement, the higher the risk of disruption as airlines rush to adapt to any new rules.""ù Airlines are obliged to refund passengers if the flight is unable to go ahead because of Brexit-related issues unless they have terms and conditions stating otherwise. It's important to remember that any separate bookings (including hotels and car rentals) will not be covered by this refund policy. Once Britain leaves Europe, new air service agreements might have to be negotiated, competition could be reduced and fares could rise. The British government has confirmed that ferries, cruises and Eurostar services will continue to run if Britain leaves Europe without a deal. It has also said that British drivers will be able to pass through the Eurotunnel.† Bus and coach services between Britain and the EU should still run, however there may be disruption to services to non-EU countries, such as Switzerland or Andorra.† The process of travelling to Europe is likely to get more complicated and involve more checks at the border. However Ms Coles said it was unlikely travellers would need a visa if they were planning to stay for no more than 90 days in any 180 day period. They should ensure they have at least six months' validity left on their passport. Those who need to renew should do so soon, as the Passport Office is already facing backlogs.† Those with holiday homes in the EU who plan to stay longer will likely need a visa. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket and that you have enough money for your stay when passing through EU border control.† You'll need an international driving permit, which cost £5.50. The exact permit will depend on the country you're travelling to. † For some EU countries drivers may need to apply a ""green card""ù permit, which acts as proof of insurance. A GB sticker or GB logo on your license plate may be required. The amount of compensation that British passengers can receive is currently dictated by an EU directive that sets out relatively generous terms. For flights you are entitled to compensation of up to Ç¨600 (£521) for delays of more than three hours, cancellations or not being allowed onto flights due to overbooking by the airline.† If the Government wishes to water down these protections it will have to change the law, which seems unlikely.† EHIC cards will become invalid from 1 January. ""Brexit negotiators have been working towards agreeing some kind of replacement, which would allow access to healthcare for travellers, but nothing has been set up yet,""ù Ms Coles said.† That means it is more important than ever to buy insurance before you travel to cover the cost of any medical emergencies.† † For people with a pre-existing medical condition, cover is even more vital. While the EHIC scheme covers pre-existing conditions, many insurance policies do not. Many insurers have stopped selling policies that would cover you if you had to cancel your holiday because of Covid-19. Even so it is still important to buy insurance before travelling, particularly after 1 January 2021. The Government has advised people to buy comprehensive cover.† Antony Martin of Insurefor.com, an policy provider, warned that prices†could rise by 15pc after Brexit. ""It's hard to know exactly at this stage because we don't know by how much the costs will change,""ù he said.† † Currencies tend to react badly to uncertainty and the value of the pound plummeted following the announcement that Britain had voted to leave the EU in 2016.† ""Recent concerns of a no-deal Brexit have seen the value of the pound drop again, and if we get to the end of the year with no deal at all, we can expect further falls. ""However, we've seen the pound respond positively to any kind of a deal, so if anything at all can be negotiated, it should help to support the currency,""ù Ms Coles said.† A fall in the value of the pound will be bad news for travellers, as their money will have less spending power abroad. It may be worth staggering purchases of holiday currency to ensure you are not buying all of it at the worst possible time. † Since 2017 Britons have not had to pay roaming charges when using their phone in the EU. If no agreement is reached to continue this, it is likely that charges will return. The cost will depend on your phone network provider and its overseas data plan. Some have said they will not reintroduce fees even if no deal is agreed.† † The Government has said†it will cap automatic data charges at £45 a month for operators that do not continue free roaming. However if your provider charges a high rate that could mean you reach the limit quickly and have to stop using your phone or purchase more data.† In the event of a no-deal current EU pet passports issued in Britain will no longer be valid.† † If you plan to travel with a pet to Europe in 2021 make sure to contact your vet at least four months beforehand to get the latest advice. You will also need to get a health certificate for each animal you travel with.† Since 1999 Britons have no longer had the right to buy duty-free goods when travelling to or from another EU country. The Government has not said whether this will change after Brexit.† However until now we have been able to bring back almost unlimited amounts of alcohol and cigarettes from Europe without having to pay tax.†New rules will be introduced in 2021 limiting Britons returning from abroad to 42 litres of beer, 18 litres of still wine and four litres of spirits or nine litres of sparkling†wine or any other alcoholic beverage less than 22pc ABV.† These limits are higher than current non-EU allowances but fall well short of current ones which allow people to bring back 110 litres of beer, 90 litres of wine and 10 litres of spirits.

The Withdrawal Agreement will still be place, so issues like the Irish border and the so-called ""divorce bill"" will be settled under its terms, but other matters will not have been so summarily nailed down. In other words, the original ""no deal"" may not be possible, but what is now known as ""no deal"" might better be viewed as a ""no trade deal"" exit.† The European Union is adamant that there is no such thing as a ""managed"" no deal†- †fearful that making a no deal†look too comfortable risks turning it into a self-fulfilling prophecy.

New post-Brexit travel rules will be a blow to second home owners
",0.625,Positive,"As the travel headlines are dominated by ever-tightening restrictions on British holidaymakers, there has been a further blow to our liberties - one which has nothing to do with the pandemic.† On Monday, just as the UK's travel media were consumed with the Government's new approach to quarantine rules, the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) ushered in another update on its website - to enshrine the post-Brexit EU travel restrictions. From January 1 2021, when the UK leaves the EU for good, British citizens may only travel visa-free to Schengen area countries for up to 90 days at a time. If, in any 180-day period, they choose to stay longer, they must apply for a visa - which would entail red tape, border queues, and perhaps a fee. This impending change has, of course, been well aired throughout Brexit debates - but it was only yesterday, while attention was elsewhere, that the FCDO's online guidelines were updated on its official website. Its country-by-country guides, and ""òLiving In' advice pages - which detail regulations for British citizens who live abroad - now include full details of the 90-day limit for visitors to EU countries, as well as Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. It advises: ""òFrom 1 January 2021, you will be able to travel to Schengen area countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period. ""òTo stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by the country to which you are travelling. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You may also need to get a visa if your visit would take you over the 90 days in 180 days limit.' The website also decrees that from January 1, holidaymakers must have at least six months left on their passport when travelling to most countries in Europe. For trips shorter than 90 days, Britons will not require a visa to visit Schengen area countries. But for those who own second homes in Europe - or travel to the continent for long periods of time - this update will be a frustration. And now, at a time when holidays feel increasingly out-of-reach, it's yet another knock to a travel industry which is already on its knees.†  ",0,Neutral

Brexit: What changes could be made to Withdrawal Agreement?
",-0.125,Negative,"A: Ministers are planning legislation to clarify - or override - key parts of the Withdrawal Agreement Boris Johnson signed up to last year. In provisions due to be put before Parliament, the Government seeks to clear up grey areas that exist in the Northern Ireland Protocol, which was established to ensure there was no hard border on the island of Ireland. While critics claim the unilateral move risks breaching commitments the UK signed up to, No 10 insists the changes are needed to end legal confusion and provide certainty for businesses in the event of no deal. A: These relate to three areas: state aid, paperwork and customs checks and tariffs. Under the Northern Ireland protocol, the UK must notify the EU of any subsidies that could affect trade between Northern Ireland and the Single Market. However, Brexiteers believe that ambiguity in the protocol could be exploited by Brussels to interfere with subsidies for businesses in Great Britain which have only a limited link to Northern Ireland. Ministers intend to address this by making clear that EU state aid rules will only apply in Northern Ireland. The second issue relates to the requirement that Northern Ireland businesses must complete export summary declarations when they send goods to Great Britain, which Brexiteers argue is incompatible with the promise that the province will enjoy ""unfettered access"" to the UK internal market. The Government therefore intends to legislate to waive this requirement. The third relates to a list of ""at risk"" goods heading into Northern Ireland from Great Britain, which could enter the EU Single Market (via the Republic of Ireland) and must therefore be subject to tariffs. Goods shown to have been consumed in Northern Ireland can have the tariff rebated, but businesses warn that this will be an administrative nightmare that will add to their costs. To lessen the impact, the Government intends to hand ministers the power to determine which goods will be considered ""at risk"" if no agreement is reached. A: The Government insists it is merely attempting to define ambiguous parts of the protocol and intends to honour its commitments set out in the withdrawal agreement. But the EU says the UK must fully implement the Withdrawal Agreement if a trade deal is to be reached. In particular, the UK seeking to determine which goods heading into Northern Ireland are liable for EU tariffs is seen as highly contentious. Brussels is also concerned about the prospect of the UK using state aid to give its businesses an unfair advantage, and is likely to object to UK attempts to dilute its obligations. If it believes the UK has reneged on its commitments, that could collapse the talks and trigger no deal. ",0,Neutral

What the UK could learn from the US on state aid rules
",0,Neutral,"Three years ago, former prime minister Theresa May backed the idea of stringent state aid rules. ""Trying to beat other countries' industries by unfairly subsidising one's own is a serious mistake,""ù she said during a speech in Florence. Today those rules, once common ground between London and Brussels, could extinguish any hope of a Brexit deal. Prime Minister Boris Johnson - a once outspoken advocate of the EU's state aid efforts - is pushing to override the rules that were agreed as part of the Withdrawal Agreement. Mr Johnson and his aide Dominic Cummings are hoping his internal market bill will free the UK from its European state aid obligations, allowing more investment in promising British tech companies. Allowing politicians to choose UK tech champions has been described as an ""extraordinary punt""ù by David Gauke, former Lord Chancellor. But this isn't about picking winners, according to Rohan Silva, a former adviser to David Cameron. Instead, he says it is about introducing subsidies and setting up incentives - something that already happens in the US. ""In America, heralded as a kind of paragon of free market capitalism, the real drivers in investment in technology are the government but also public sector pensions and other university endowments,""ù he told the Today programme.† ""The truth is that EU state aid rules, designed for another era altogether, do make it much more difficult that they ought to do the right thing and channel investment into startups.""ù ",-0.25,Negative

Once the UK has left the Customs Union and Single Market at the end of the year, it will be treated as a non-EU country. Before introducing travel restrictions, the commission wants EU countries to consider how many new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people in an area there are over two weeks, the percentage of positive tests carried out over seven days and the number of tests per 100,000 people carried out over seven days.† ",0.25,Positive

Could we yet be heading for a last-ditch Brexit breakthrough?
",0.25,Positive,"It was the day before Boris Johnson made a rare Saturday statement in the House of Commons announcing his new Brexit deal that he congratulated Sir Bill Cash for what he described at the time as the ""vindication of your entire political career"". The compliment had been preceded by a mammoth eight-hour meeting in Number 10 last October, when the Tory veteran and lifelong Eurosceptic had successfully managed to persuade the Prime Minister that he needed a ""get out of jail free card"" should future trade talks with the EU end in stalemate. Mindful that Mr Johnson's hastily-renegotiated withdrawal agreement was viewed by most Brexiteers as ""Theresa May's deal in a blonde wig"", the indefatigable MP for Stone, a constitutional lawyer, resolved to find a solution to a mounting problem. Without the deal, and amid a growing remainer rebellion, Brexit faced being lost altogether. But with it, Britain would be tied into a Northern Ireland Protocol that left it exposed to exploitation by Brussels. Maastricht rebel Sir Bill, who at 80 is the oldest sitting MP, suggested that a clause be inserted into the Withdrawal Agreement Bill insisting that ""the Parliament of the United Kingdom is sovereign... notwithstanding the withdrawal agreement"". Section 38 was duly created, specifying that ""nothing in this Act derogates from the sovereignty of the Parliament of the United Kingdom"".

Twilight of Democracy by Anne Applebaum, review: a querulous and flawed analysis of Europe
",-0.75,Negative,"Such attitudes are, indeed, perverse but I am not sure these personal vignettes, drawn from Applebaum's circle, tell us much about a breakdown in Western democracy. Poland and Hungary do not exactly have a long history as beacons of enlightened thinking, and it is a stretch to read across, as Applebaum does, from her broken friendships to a crisis of modern Western liberalism. She takes a similar approach to the UK, another country she knows well since she has written for many of its publications, including The Daily Telegraph and The Spectator. This time it is Brexit that has caused the falling out with friends, among them Boris Johnson, who was at Oxford at the same time as her husband. She trots out the hoary old criticisms of Johnson for writing stories detrimental to the aggrandising ambitions of the bloc while working in Brussels for this newspaper. These included articles like the ""Threat to British Pink Sausages""ù and other ""half-true stories built around a grain of fact that poked fun at the EU and inevitably portrayed it as a font of regulatory madness""ù. Through his pernicious journalism, apparently, Johnson single-handedly created Euroscepticism and laid the foundations for Brexit delivered by way of another set of lies, falsehoods and phoney nostalgia. To my mind, one big flaw in this set of observations is that they imply that a common thread runs through these political developments beyond the fact Applebaum does not like them. Yet they are not similar. For instance, while Poland and Hungary cling to attitudes that many in this country might find unsavoury, even though they were commonplace a generation ago, Boris Johnson leads the most socially liberal Conservative government ever. It is in favour of taking three million Hong Kong residents to rescue them from Chinese despotism, has top Cabinet posts in the hands of second-generation immigrants, promotes gay rights and excoriates racism. What is it that Applebaum finds so offensive? The only answer is Brexit because that involves the UK turning its back on the sort of supranational, rules-imposed world that she sees as a benign dispensation. Many of us do not think it is benign, and have expressed that view in a referendum and two general elections, which seems democratic enough. This is a personal, somewhat querulous book, whose jaundiced assessment of current politics will be lapped up by those who despise Boris, loathe Brexit, decry Trump, fear populism and find it impossible to come to terms with what is happening in the world. But its prognosis is far too bleak - or at least it was until the world Applebaum set out to describe changed utterly with the arrival of the coronavirus. Pandemics, like wars, may bring people together in common purpose, but they also fuel nationalism and suppress liberalism. She may fall out with a few more people yet.

Britain looks to Berlin to break Brexit deadlock
",-0.375,Negative,"British negotiators are banking on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to unblock Brexit talks after Michel Barnier accused the UK of wrecking the chances of a trade deal with the EU.

A senior UK source close to the negotiations said Mrs Merkel's reputation as a dealmaker on the European stage could be key to end the impasse. ""It is definitely possible now with the (EU budget) wrapped up that member states will become more engaged in this process in Brussels and get them moving forwards politically,"" the source said. ""The German presidency, obviously, should pay more attention to what's going on, which I think has got to be helpful. ""Michel Barnier, in the final phase, hopefully ought to have some political guidance,"" the source added. Talks broke up in London on Thursday with Mr Barnier using a press conference to accuse the UK of rendering a deal ""unlikely"" in light of the Government's refusal to back down on its red lines. Barnier said the EU wants ""a balanced, sustainable and long-term solution"" on access to the UK's fishing stocks to protect ""the many men and women whose livelihoods depend on it.""† Brussels also wants the Government to commit to a so-called level playing field with oversight by the European Court of Justice. It wants the UK to apply its state aid rules after the end of the transition phase on December 31; EU officials want British legislation to evolve in line with regulations from Brussels.

Sir Ian Botham earns peerage for his Brexit campaigning
",0,Neutral,"Sir Ian Botham is to be handed a peerage by Boris Johnson along with a group of Brexit loyalists to mark his first anniversary as Prime Minister. The former England cricketer is one of approximately 30 new peers due to be announced later this month. Widely regarded as one of the greatest all-rounders, Sir Ian campaigned for Brexit in the 2016 referendum and appeared alongside Mr Johnson at a Vote Leave event in Durham. Speaking several weeks before polling day, he suggested that predictions of a Remain victory were overstated and urged people to vote to return powers to the UK that had been ""eroded by Brussels"". According to†The Times, the list of new peers also includes four former Labour MPs: Frank Field and Gisela Stuart, who backed the Leave side in 2016, and John Woodcock and Ian Austin, who later supported the Prime Minister's Brexit deal. Mr Field, Mr Woodcock and Mr Austin also quit the Labour Party during Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. However, in a move likely to surprise Brexiteers, the Prime Minister is also believed to have awarded peerages to the former chancellors Ken Clarke and Philip Hammond, as well as former minister Ed Vaizey. All three were stripped of the Conservative whip last year after voting against the Government in a crunch Brexit vote and their inclusion suggests Mr Johnson is attempting to heal any lingering divisions with ""One Nation"" Tory MPs. Shortly before his victory in the Tory leadership contest last year, Mr Johnson likened his approach to that of Sir Ian, an all-rounder, when asked how he would deal with Brexit. Contrasting his style to that of his predecessor Theresa May, whose hero was Sir Geoffrey Boycott, a cautious opening batsman, Mr Johnson said at the time: ""If I may venture a cricketing metaphor, I think we've had quite a lot of Boycott on the wicket and it is time for Botham to come in ... particularly in the EU negotiations, we cannot have the same old, same old.""

The pound has been volatile when Brexit is at the fore, is now the time to 'hedge' your investments?
",0,Neutral,"The deadline to complete a Brexit deal by the end of the year is edging closer. Investors should be making plans on where to put their savings - and making the right call on currency could make a huge difference to returns. Since the Brexit referendum the pound has fallen from $1.50 to $1.25, a 17pc decline. Investors who buy funds sometimes have the option to shield their investments from currency movements through ""hedged""ù share classes. These cancel out the exposure to the local currency of the underlying investments by ""hedging""ù the money back into pounds. When the pound rises, investors in these funds make better returns but if it falls they lose out. The opposite is true for an ""unhedged""ù fund, which provides full exposure to both the currency and the underlying assets of an overseas market. Rob Morgan of Charles Stanley, a fund shop, said over the past few years a weaker pound had significantly reduced returns for British investors who used hedged units for their overseas funds. If negotiations prove difficult investors should own unhedged versions of their funds, which will provide better returns if the pound falls. ",-0.625,Negative

Chlorinated chicken 'alarmism' must end, says head of post-Brexit advisory body for trade deals
",0,Neutral,"The ""alarmism""ù over chlorinated chicken must end, the head of a new body advising the Government over trade deals has said, as he called for a ""clear-eyed perspective""ù on what works for consumers. Tim Smith, a former Tesco executive who has been appointed chairman of the Trade and Agriculture Commission, said policy over trade deals with the US and other countries must be ""informed by evidence and expert opinion""ù. In an article for†The Telegraph, Mr Smith does not explicitly rule out the possibility of chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef being allowed into the country as part of a US trade deal. But he insists he will fight to ""ensure UK farmers do not face unfair competition and that their high animal welfare and production standards are not undermined""ù. Liz Truss, the International Trade Secretary, announced the membership and scope of the Commission on Friday, saying it will advise the Government on how to protect farmers as well as maximising export opportunities for them. The Commission was set up partly to diffuse the ongoing row over the potential for cheap animal products to be imported into the UK that are farmed using methods banned in Britain. The US wants the freedom to sell products such as chlorine-washed chicken to the UK, and hardline Brexiteers have argued that there is no health risk and British consumers should get the benefit of cheaper food on the shelves. Chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef are currently banned in the UK because they are produced using methods that fall well below British animal welfare standards. Farmers insist it should stay that way, and Ms Truss insisted on Friday that ""our high food and animal welfare standards won't be compromised""ù. Mr Smith, a former chief executive of the Food Standards Agency and former group technical director of Tesco, said: ""The UK's arrival as an independent trading nation was always going to be accompanied by a solid public debate about where our food comes from and how it is produced. ""Our trade policy ... should be informed by evidence, expert opinion and crafted in close consultation with the whole supply chain. There is no reason why it cannot be debated in a sensible and level-headed way. ""The alarmism recently around issues like imports of chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef - both of which are banned in the UK - do neither the industry nor the public any favours. ""Having a clear-eyed perspective on what is fair and works for consumers, farmers, food producers and animals is important. This is a time for cool heads and thoughtful discussion.""ù The new commission, which can only advise the Government, rather than instruct it to do anything, includes representatives of the NFU and the British Retail Consortium. Minette Batters, President of the NFU, said the establishment of the Commission was ""a hugely important development in ensuring UK farming's high standards of animal welfare and environmental protection are not undermined in future trade deals""ù. Mr Smith said the ""landscape has changed""ù for the entire food sector but he believes there are ""more opportunities than risks""ù, such as opening new beef and lamb markets in the US or increasing cheese exports to Japan and Asia-Pacific. He said part of the Commission's role would be to make the most of such opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses ""who have been hardest hit by coronavirus""ù.

Brussels backs down over London clearing houses in win for the City

It will kick in if the UK and the European Union fail to reach a Brexit deal. The decision is likely to be seen as a climbdown by EU chiefs,†who have long resented Britain's dominance in clearing. A power grab was launched shortly after the Brexit vote to try and force Continental firms to clear trades through hubs within the bloc, but this stalled when it became clear no other financial centre could handle the volume of activity done in the City. Clearing houses such as LCH, ICE Clear Europe and LME Clear perform a vital role in greasing the wheels of international finance, standing between buyers and sellers to settle trades and ensure sellers get paid. Access to London's clearing houses for financial contracts such as swaps and futures is a key issue for European firms because the UK dominates the continent's Ç¨735 trillion (£658 trillion) annual market.

Electoral Commission must be abolished and handed back to councils, says Vote Leave as director speaks out
",0,Neutral,"The electoral watchdog should be abolished and its powers handed back to local councils, the three remaining board members of the Vote Leave campaign group have said. The call came as Alan Halsall, one of the directors, spoke out for the first time to lay bare the toll taken by the Electoral Commission's pursuit of him in the years following the 2016 referendum. MPs on the public administration and constitutional affairs committee are due to grill senior officials from the Commission about its work on Thursday. Earlier this month, the Government said it was considering whether to allow the Electoral Commission to have beefed-up powers to undertake its own prosecutions. A review by the committee for standards in public life said it would ""consider whether the commission should play a role in criminal prosecutions for breaches of election finance laws"". This came despite, in May, police dropping an investigation into Mr Halsall†and Darren Grimes, the founder of pro-Brexit†youth group BeLeave, for failing to declare a payment related to the campaign. The watchdog said BeLeave ""spent more than £675,000 with [Canadian data firm] Aggregate IQ under a common plan with Vote Leave"". This spending took Vote Leave over its £7 million legal spending limit by almost £500,000. Vote Leave had said they were given the go-ahead to give the money to BeLeave and had acted within the rules. As large legal costs mounted, Vote Leave paid a £61,000 fine last year but denied any wrongdoing, while Mr Grimes won an appeal against his £20,000 fine. Vote Leave is currently being wound up by its directors Mr Halsall, Jon Moynihan and Daniel Hodson, a legal process that can take months. In a statement to The Telegraph, the trio said: ""The Board of Vote Leave is firmly of the belief that the Electoral Commission should be abolished, and its functions returned to the various institutions that have traditionally occupied those roles."" Mr Moynihan has suggested that the commission's powers are divided between existing bodies, with Companies House keeping a register of candidates or campaigners. He added that a group of senior council returning officers should regulate referendums and check donations†and expenses against the law, while the police would investigate and prosecute infractions. In a submission to the committee, entitled Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes? (Who will guard us from the guardians?) Mr Moynihan said the commission was ""an experiment that has failed"". Mr Moynihan said the commission was set up by Tony Blair's Labour Government in 2000 ""as a solution to a perceived problem that all agreed was at worst only a small one - and which in reality didn't exist at all"". He added: ""The commission's recent actions have created a situation where honest citizens will now understandably fear to engage in the democratic process for elections or referenda, especially if the EC is allowed to continue. ""Who, having behaved blamelessly, will want to expose themselves to having years of their life taken away, having to defend themselves against financial sanctions and worse, their reputations attemptedly brought into disrepute?"" Writing for The Telegraph, Mr Halsall said: ""I am an honest, innocent man who volunteered to help in a campaign that went to the heart of the future of our country. ""You may not agree with my opinions, but I got involved with the best of intentions and a desire to play†my part in contributing to a democratic debate around†Brexit. I ask you, having read this story, would any of you now volunteer to do the same?"" An Electoral Commission spokesman said on Saturday: ""The Electoral Commission was created to provide integrity and transparency of party and election finance; well-run elections and referendums which produce results that are accepted; and to develop public understanding of the way our democracy works. ""These are vital functions, which our democracy cannot be without."" Sources pointed out that the commission imposed fines on Vote Leave for breaking electoral law, which†have been paid. They added that the commission referred Vote Leave to the police so that potential offences that lie outside oits remit could be properly investigated. These were separate and additional offences to those the commission found Vote Leave had committed. It is right that potential electoral offences are properly investigated by the appropriate authority, they said. ",-0.25,Negative

Car production flatlines again in worst May since 1946
",-0.625,Negative,"Car production fell by 95pc†in May, with just 5,314 vehicles built at UK factories, according to new figures. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said output was a slight improvement on April, when only 197 cars were built, but with factories still closed or running at reduced capacity, it still marked the worst May since 1946. Around two-thirds of the UK's automotive plants started getting back to business last month, but capacity was severely held back by social distancing requirements and reduced demand. The trade body said that with key global markets only just beginning to reopen, and the UK remaining in lockdown, just 4,260 cars were exported in May, most into the EU, the US and China. Only slightly more than 1,000 cars were built for domestic buyers. In the first five months of the year, UK factories built 324,763 cars, a decline of 41.7pc†on the same period in 2019 and a loss of more than 230,000, with the full year outlook now expected to be fewer than one million units. The SMMT said its latest research showed that liquidity was still a major issue for automotive businesses despite the ""lifeline"" provided by the Government's support schemes. Up to one in six jobs is at risk of redundancy when the furlough scheme comes to an end in November, the SMMT warned. Chief executive Mike Hawes said: ""May's figures are yet more evidence of why the UK industry, like its global rivals, needs dedicated support to drive a successful restart. ""Government assistance so far has been vital in keeping many businesses afloat, but the job isn't done. Measures to boost cashflow, including additional and tailored finance schemes, tax relief and business rates deferral would deliver immediate results when liquidity is most acute. ""We have to retain the highly skilled jobs the sector provides but also ensure the business conditions are competitive so we can unlock the investment that will drive long-term recovery - a green recovery - which is inextricably linked to the sector's success."" The SMMT added that with the automotive industry†already hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, it cannot withstand a second shock of a hard Brexit.

Markets dropped around the world as jitters over a new trade war combined with fears of a second wave of Covid-19 after infections jumped in the US. The FTSE 100 dropped 3.1pc while the Dow Jones was down 2.9pc in early trade. Speaking to MPs on the International Trade Committee, Mrs Truss said:†""The US talks a good game about free trade and low tariffs but the reality is that many UK products have been kept unfairly out of their markets.†We're not going to rush into a deal and there is no deadline.""ù She cited 25pc American tariffs on British steel and threats of further levies on cars, adding that a US ban on lamb imports amounted to protectionism.

EU says 'sovereign' UK has taken back control of its fishing waters

The week's negotiations ended with no significant progress on fishing, which is one of the major obstacles to agreeing a free trade deal with Brussels before the end of the transition period at the end of the year.

Britain ready to allow import of chlorinated chicken from US

The latest Government proposal for a trade deal with the US is for a ""dual tariff"" regime that imposes different levels of duty on imported foods, depending on whether they comply with UK animal welfare standards. Hormone-fed beef, chlorinated chicken and other foods that use techniques banned in Britain will be allowed across the Atlantic, but ministers want to use tariffs to make it uneconomical for US producers to export them to the UK. High-quality foods, such as organically-reared free range meat, would be subject to lower tariffs in order to encourage foreign producers to lift their animal welfare to British levels. The National Farmers' Union described the scheme as ""a significant step forwards"" because it would prevent the US from flooding the UK market with cheap food produced using techniques banned in Britain.

British ski instructor wins years-long fight to teach in France

Simon Butler, 57, was fined a total of 42,000 euros ($45,500) in 2013 and 2014 for repeatedly taking out clients at his ski school in the upmarket†Alps resort of Megeve, despite lacking French certification. Local instructors who joined the case as plaintiffs accused him of unfair competition, implying that securing a license from the British Association of Snowsport Instructors was easier than meeting the French requirements. Butler appealed the fines, which also came with a suspended prison sentence, arguing that under EU law his British ski training licence allowed him to operate across the bloc. The dispute took on a political dimension when Butler appeared for a 2014 hearing accompanied by a spokesman for UKIP, who denounced ""a blatant display of national discrimination by the French government"". In 2016, Butler filed a counterclaim against the Sports Ministry at the administrative court in Lyon, southeast France. Although he won that case, a criminal appeals court in Chambery upheld the original fines.

The Brexit boost: Government to axe tariffs on 60 per cent of global imports next year†

Longer Brexit transition period will spark more delays, poll finds
",0,Neutral,"Almost half of Britons believe extending the transition period would lead to further delays, according to a poll, as Downing Street warned that Michel Barnier's mandate was ""totally unnegotiable"" on the issues that stalled post-Brexit trade talks last week. A survey published by a new pro-Brexit think tank suggests the public believes extending the transition period beyond December 31 would be likely to leave the UK locked into the EU's orbit for the foreseeable future. †The poll is contained in a report by the Centre for Brexit Policy which claims that opting for an extension within the coming months could cost up to £378 billion. With talks between the UK and the EU over the future trade agreement now at an impasse, Boris Johnson has faced calls to extend the transition period before the July deadline to do so, in order to focus on the Covid-19 pandemic. But Downing Street has ruled out an extension, instead suggesting the UK could simply leave the EU's customs union and single market without a comprehensive trade deal in place. On Saturday night, a No10 source insisted that ""no government"" would agree to some of the demands currently being made by the EU, through Mr Barnier, its chief negotiator, including that the bloc would effectively have ""oversight"" of UK legislation in order to maintain a ""level playing field"" on tax and regulation. ""We've made very clear that such conditions would be unacceptable and can never form the basis of an agreement,"" the source said. ""Michel Barnier is doing his best. He must know that he has an impossible job with a mandate that in certain areas is totally unnegotiable with us and gives him no flexibility where he needs it.""ù UK sources have called for a ""political injection"" from EU leaders to break the impasse.

UK bans PPE exports to countries outside the EU, unless on humanitarian grounds
",0.625,Positive,"Britain has imposed a ban on the sale of personal protective equipment (PPE) to countries outside of the European Union, as a result of a rule drawn up in Brussels.

The regulation is embarrassing for ministers, who have criticised other countries for imposing export bans on PPE amid a global shortage of the protective clothing being used to shield medics from Covid-19. The Government has insisted that reciprocal trade is needed with countries such as China to help ensure that overseas governments provide the UK with equipment that it needs during the course of the pandemic. But the Government has been left with ""no choice"" but to accept the rule under the terms of the Brexit transition period, which is due to end on December 31.

Michel Barnier accuses UK of wasting time in Brexit trade negotiations
",0.125,Positive,"Michel Barnier accused Britain of wasting precious time in the UK-EU trade negotiations on Thursday, before warning London that the price of any trade deal with Brussels was an agreement on fisheries.† The EU's chief negotiator attacked the UK for ruling out any extension of the Brexit transition period to buy time for more talks, at the same time as failing to engage on key issues during this week's negotiations. ""The UK cannot refuse to extend the position, and at the same time, slow down discussions on important areas,"" Mr Barnier said in Brussels as he implied Britain was running down the clock on the talks.† ""Limited progress was made in bridging the gaps between us and the EU,""ù a UK government spokesman said. ""We do not recognise the suggestion that we have not engaged seriously with the EU."" ""We are ready to keep talking but that will not make us any more likely to agree to the EU's proposals in these areas, which are unprecedented and do not take account of the fact that we have left the EU as an independent state."" The agreement must be finalised by the end of the year, if there is no extension, or Britain will trade with the EU, its major trading partner, on WTO terms.†Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, reiterated the government's position at the daily coronavirus press conference, claiming the general election result proved voters wanted no further delays with Brexit. ""Time is short, more than ever, the clock is ticking, more than ever. We have eight months, scarcely eight months, before us,""ù Mr Barnier said after the week's round of negotiations, which were carried out by videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic. He criticised the UK† for failing to ""commit seriously""ù on fishing, level playing field guarantees† on tax, state aid, labour rights and the environment† and the governance of the future trading relationship. He said there were ""legitimate questions"" over whether trade talks should proceed. David Frost, the UK's chief negotiator, said, ""We are ready to work to agree a fisheries agreement which reflects our rights under international law to control our own waters and†provides for annual negotiations over access based on scientific principles. We won't agree to continuing the Common Fisheries Policy."" He added, ""We support high standards. But there is no need for novel and unprecedented 'level playing field' rules, for example tying us to EU laws, or a role for the EU Court."" ""At the moment the British listen politely but they don't engage in the areas where they don't have an interest to find an agreement,""ù a senior EU official said. Britain did not bring forward a legal text to be negotiated on fisheries because it felt the divides were too stark, which angered Mr Barnier, who said there had been ""no tangible progress""ù† on the emotive issue. The EU wants an agreement that replicates the status quo, guaranteeing EU boats access to UK waters under existing conditions. The UK insists fisheries should be separate from the trade agreement and access to waters be negotiated on an annual basis, as it is with Norway.† ""The EU will not agree to any future economic partnership that does not include a balanced, sustainable and long term solution on fisheries. That should be crystal clear to the UK,""ù Mr Barnier said.† Under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement, Britain has until July to request a one off extension to the transition period of up to two years. A membership fee in return for membership of the Single Market would need to be negotiated with the EU.† The British remain bullish that the negotiations could be finished by December 31, despite the coronavirus forcing talks to be held online and the cancellation of the last two planned rounds.† There were also deep divides over the future role for the European Court of Justice and around judicial cooperation and security, Mr Barnier said.†† Mr Barnier said that, despite the UK talk of ""sovereign equals""ù, the† reality of the negotiations was that the EU's market of 450 million customers was far bigger than the 66 million in Britain.† He also demanded ""clear evidence""ù that Britain was making progress in preparing for customs checks in the Irish sea as part of the implementation of the Irish border deal in the Withdrawal Agreement.† ""A new partnership with the UK can only be built on trust. And this requires that already agreed commitments are applied,""ù he said.

Fishing industry reeling from coronavirus restaurant shutdown
",0,Neutral,"Last week whispers from Brussels that the EU may cave on the UK's Brexit fishing demands were welcomed by many in the UK's fishing communities. But now, even in the event that French trawlers are held at bay, the British fishing industry faces a graver threat. With restaurants and pubs forced to close their doors to halt the spread of coronavirus, fish prices at markets across the south-west have slumped. Harbours all along Cornwall and Devon's coastline are packed with moored fishing boats. ""This is a dire situation for us,""ù says Paul Trebilcock, CEO of the Cornish Fish Producers' Organisation. The impact has been sudden. Just two weeks ago, fish sales were holding relatively well. But at the start of last week, prices and demand tumbled. ""Exports went first,""ù explains Trebilcock, ""it was big blow for shellfish catchers, whose produce goes almost exclusively to export markets in Europe and Asia.""ù As the week went on, advice from government about restaurants then turned off UK demand overnight. ""By midweek the shellfish market had stopped completely;†the merchants just couldn't take any at all because they couldn't pass it on to retailers or restaurants.""ù Prices for white fish were also slashed as demand plummeted. ""The price for pollock went from £4 a kilo to 80 pence on Plymouth market,""ù says Dave Bond, a 62-year-old fisherman from Looe, Cornwall, ""from a fishermen's point of view, it's a disaster.""ù Adversity is not new to the UK fishing industry. ""We've had a tough time for several years now, mostly because of fishing quotas""ù says Joe Clive, who owns Newlyn Fish Company, ""but we've been feeling more optimistic about the future because of Brexit.""ù EU documents leaked a few weeks ago added to this optimism. These indicated that the draft free trade agreement being negotiated between the EU and the UK would soften the language regarding EU access to British fishing water, from ""upholding""ù the status quo to ""respecting""ù it. †""After last week, some of the expectations that had been built up [by Brexit] seemed more likely,""ù says Trebilcock.

Harry Broadman, a trade negotiator in the Bush and Clinton administrations and managing director of the California-based Berkeley Research Group, attacked the decision and said the Treasury could even be forced to abandon the move in the face of opposition in Washington. ""The Chancellor's move, while widely expected, will almost certainly be strongly opposed by Washington and be a serious impediment to the UK successfully negotiating an FTA with the US.

UK travellers 'will have to get passports stamped every time they enter EU'
",0.125,Positive,"British travellers will need to have their passports stamped each time they enter the EU after the Brexit transition period expires, The Telegraph understands. British negotiators had requested that UK nationals should be allowed to use ""EU citizens""†lanes after January 1 next year but were told that was not possible, according to two sources with knowledge of the negotiations. As a result, UK travellers will need to join the same queue as other non-EU citizens, submitting to a physical passport inspection and receiving a passport stamp. It is understood that a UK request for nationals to use electronic e-gates was rejected because the EU's borderless Schengen zone does not currently have the technology to accommodate ""third country"" nationals. ""The technology is being developed in the next couple of years†and, when it is available, it should be possible for UK nationals to use it - but until then they will have to queue for a stamp in their passports,"" said a source with knowledge of the talks. Currently, non-EU nationals from pre-cleared countries including Japan, South Korea, Australia and the United States are able to use e-gates at British airports, but this is not yet technically possible in the Schengen zone. EU officials said that, once the capacity had been built, it was a reasonable assumption that UK nationals would be able to use Schengen zone e-gates. Separately, EU officials confirmed last week that the bloc's plans to introduce a US-style visa waiver scheme had been delayed until 2023. The European Travel Information and Authorisation System scheme will require non-EU nationals from around 60 ""visa exempt"" countries, including the UK, to pay a Ç¨7 fee to obtain authorisation that will enable them to travel visa-free to the EU. The scheme had initially been planned for roll-out by the end of 2021, with full implementation by the end of the following year, but it has now been put back. The UK government's advice for travel to Europe after January 1 next year says tourists will have visa-free travel to EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. Subject to the outcome of negotiations, longer stays or business travel may require a visa, with the government warning that business travellers should check that their professional qualifications are recognised in different EU countries. As well as using separate lanes to those used by EU citizens, the advice also warns that travellers may need to show a ""return or onward ticket"" and demonstrate that they have enough money for their stay in the EU country.

Pygmy goats, Brexit and Mrs Brown's Boys: read an extract from Jan Morris's diary

It was exhilaratingly full of life - not crowded life exactly, but speckled life. Ours is a pebble beach, so there were no jam-packed sunseekers and sandcastlers, but clumps of people were scattered all across the foreshore, celebrating the sunshine in different ways. There were bathers, of course, and solitary scavengers I took to be fossil-hunters, and children at rock pools who were almost certainly looking for crabs, and lovers, of course, in the secluded lee of the promenade. Far away, almost out of sight, I could see bravos wading in twos and threes, and many dogs running towards the blue-green tide, and brilliantly across the whole waterscape a solitary windsurfer was storming and swishing and showing off his skills among the waves of the bay.† I thought it was all just wonderful, and to engage myself with that happy concourse I used a few brazen techniques that have served me well during a writer's lifetime. For instance, ""I could do that once,""ù I might like to remark of a child precariously wobbling along a parapet, and instantly I am en rapport with its parents - ""Couldn't we all! Those were the days!""ù Or if, passing a woman with an ice cream, I appeal that she give me a lick, we often end with her and her friends in hilarious comity. And so on. The thing is that nearly all of us, old and young, on such a day, on such a beach, in such shared exhilaration, only want to be at one with the world, and welcome even the tiresome conversational devices of elderly literati.

Boris Johnson now backs tunnel, not bridge to Northern Ireland, Scottish Secretary discloses
",0,Neutral,"Boris Johnson now wants to press ahead with a tunnel to link the British mainland with Northern Ireland rather than a bridge, the Scottish Secretary has announced. Alister Jack said he and the Prime Minister both favour examining a tunnel from Portpatrick in Dumfries and Galloway to Larne in the province. He said a tunnel would be cheaper to build than Mr Johnson's previous plan for a bridge, which he warned may have to close up to 100 days a year thanks to high winds. It would also avoid a World War Two munitions dump in an area known as Beaufort's Dyke and could be built by 2030, he said. Mr Jack argued the project would strengthen the Union by joining the four home nations together with a physical link. He said other options would be examined, including a crossing that incorporates both a bridge and tunnel, but he and the Prime Minister were ""on exactly the same page"" about the tunnel proposal.

Boris Johnson rejects EU demands to bind UK to European human rights laws
",-0.75,Negative,"Boris Johnson is preparing to reject EU demands to guarantee that the UK will continue to be bound by European human rights laws once the country becomes fully independent, The Telegraph can disclose. This newspaper understands that British negotiators will refuse to accept proposed clauses in a post-Brexit trade agreement that would require the UK to remain signed up to the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) - leaving the door open to break away from the treaty as soon as next year. The move is threatening to cause a major row within the Government, with some figures strongly opposed to the country leaving the convention, which was signed after the Second World War to safeguard rights across the continent. Several Cabinet ministers, including Priti Patel and Dominic Raab, have previously warned that the ECHR has been repeatedly ""abused"" by European judges. Dominic Cummings, who is now the Prime Minister's most senior adviser, has previously attacked the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg for judgments, based on the ECHR, requiring the UK to give prisoners the right to vote, and blocking the deportation of ""dangerous"" foreign criminals. Writing in 2018, Mr Cummings said: ""If I get involved in politics again, then a referendum on the ECHR should be high on the agenda ""î and bear in mind most people probably think we're already leaving it because of the 2016 referendum, so imagine how mad they'll be when they realise we're still in it."" The European Commission's formal negotiating mandate, published last week, revealed that the EU is seeking clauses in the bloc's trade agreement with the UK that would automatically end all ""law enforcement cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters"" if the UK were to ""denounce the ECHR"". It also wants provisions requiring the suspension of cooperation between EU and UK authorities if Britain repeals the Human Rights Act - the legislation allowing British courts to apply the ECHR. The††Telegraph understands that Mr Johnson's negotiating team, led by David Frost, his EU adviser, will reject demands for the clauses, so that the UK can be free to leave the ECHR or repeal the Human Rights Act at a later date. A Tory source described the demands as ""inappropriate"", stating: ""We will uphold human rights in our way."" The UK's mandate contained no reference to upholding the convention in the future. Mr Raab, now the Foreign Secretary, and Ms Patel, the Home Secretary have previously called for the Human Rights Act to be replaced with a British Bill of Rights, which Mr Raab said would ""reform our relationship with the Strasbourg court."" The Bill of Rights was pledged by David Cameron in 2010 but blocked by the Liberal Democrats. Martin Howe, a QC who helped draw up Mr Cameron's proposals, said: ""It is extremely important that we keep our options open for the future."" Mr Cummings has stated that simply repealing the Act would simply ""tweak"" the current situation. ""Provided we are still committed under international law to the Strasbourg court, then we will continue to suffer from the often abysmal judgements made there,"" he wrote in a blog in 2015, in the run-up to the referendum. Mr Johnson's election manifesto pledged to ""update"" the Human Rights Act to ensure ""a proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security and effective government."" Meanwhile, the UK is due to start separate trade talks with the US later this month - putting further pressure on Brussels to reach an agreement.

Revealed: UK's red lines for Brexit trade deal
",0,Neutral,"The UK has today set out its mandate for the next stage of the Brexit trade negotiations with the EU, warning†that if an agreement cannot be reached within four months, no deal is back on the table. Britain wants ""liberalised market access for trade in goods""ù with no tariffs, fees, charges or quotas on manufactured or agricultural goods. The Government accepts that traders must stick to rules of origin to ensure Britain does not become an assembly hub for goods coming from other parts of the world. The agreement should protect both sides from dumping or subsidised goods and should reduce ""technical barriers to trade""ù by agreeing mutual recognition of standards. Britain does not accept the EU's demands for a level playing field on standards and regulations, as the UK must be free to diverge from the EU if it wishes. It should ""address regulatory barriers to trade between the UK and EU, while preserving each party's right to regulate, as is standard in free trade agreements""ù. The mandate calls for the EU to make it as simple as possible for regulations and standards to be mutually recognised without either side being allowed to dictate rules to the other. It says it should ""establish a framework for either party to request that the other consider its technical regulation to be equivalent to its own regulation""ù. Individual arrangements should cover cross-border compliance on drugs and medical products; motor vehicles and parts; organic products; chemicals and marine equipment. The UK will maintain a ""robust""ù regime on food standards in line with its ""existing high standards""ù and wants an agreement on mutual recognition of standards in individual food groups in line with the EU's trade agreement with Canada. Services make up 80 per cent of Britain's exports to the EU, and the mandate calls for mutual recognition of professional qualifications to ease the trade in services. The mandate also rules out limitations on market access, such as economic needs tests, and calls for Britain to be given ""most favoured nation""ù status to provide for ""ongoing liberalisation""ù on the trade in services. Britain will have its ""own regime of subsidy control""ù but will agree to notify the EU every two years of any subsidies given to British firms, which the EU would also have to do. The agreement should include ""reciprocal commitments not to weaken or reduce the level of protection afforded by labour laws and standards in order to encourage trade or investment""ù. It means Britain will agree not to lower workers' rights in order to gain a competitive advantage, and expects the EU to do the same. Britain will be free to set its own environmental laws, but the agreement should include ""reciprocal commitments not to weaken or reduce the level of protection afforded by environmental laws in order to encourage trade or investment""ù, meaning environmental standards must not be diminished. Britain is ready to consider an agreement on fishing but only in the context that the UK will be an independent coastal state at the end of this year. Existing EU quotas will end, with Britain able to decide who has access to its fishing waters and what they can catch. Britain will negotiate separate deals on fishing with other coastal states such as Norway. The UK and EU should agree a ""comprehensive air transport agreement""ù to ensure flights continue as normal, regardless of any other trade agreements. There should no restrictions on frequency or capacity of flights. This would run in tandem with a Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement (BASA), meaning each side recognises the other's safety standards. Britain is seeking a standalone agreement on law and order, which should ""facilitate police and judicial cooperation between the UK and EU member states; equip operational partners on both sides with capabilities that help protect the public and bring criminals to justice; and promote the security of all our citizens""ù. Britain's intelligence and policing regime is one of its trump cards in the negotiations, and it is offering a status-quo deal on sharing information, cooperating over arrest warrants and DNA database sharing in return for the trade deal it wants.† Arrangements over trade crossing the Irish border are covered by the Withdrawal Agreement and will be discussed separately from the overall trade talks.

A week before the first round of formal talks in Brussels, a source close to the negotiations claimed that EU countries appeared ""divided"" and were ""distracted"" by issues such as securing the return of the Elgin Marbles to Greece, rather than focusing on the ""important decisions"". The claim escalates a propaganda war between Downing Street and Brussels, which saw the two sides engage in a public row last week over the type of trade deal that the UK could strike with the EU. This week, senior ministers will sign off on the UK's list of demands for the negotiations in a meeting of the Cabinet's ""exit strategy"", or XS, committee on Tuesday, with the paper due to be published online on Thursday. During the following week, the Government will publish its negotiating mandate for a free trade agreement with the US, in a move that will put further pressure on EU negotiators. The mandate for the EU talks is likely to spark fresh rows with Brussels. Last week David Frost, Boris Johnson's chief negotiator, issued a public rebuke over the EU's own draft list of demands, which insists that a trade deal must include onerous ""level playing field"" requirements to prevent the UK from becoming an ultra-competitive competitive ""low tax, low regulation"" economy on its doorstep. Mr Frost now leads a 40-strong unit, called Taskforce Europe, which is dedicated to the talks. The first round of negotiations is due to take place in Brussels during the week beginning March 2.

British airlines could be banned from stopping off in EU airports
",0,Neutral,"European Union governments want the power to suspend any future agreement made with the UK after the negotiation of a new free trade deal as part of its ""toolbox""ù of punitive measures against Britain after Brexit.† The move could give Brussels the power to prevent British airlines landing in EU airports on their way to non-EU destinations or restrict cabotage rights, if deals on those issues are struck after the end of this year and if Britain ignores rulings by a dispute panel overseeing the future partnership. The push is designed to stiffen the European Commission's resolve in the face of British resistance to any form of dispute resolution that cuts across different sectors.†The British government is understood to prefer a series of sector-specific deals rather than an umbrella structure covering all deals and allowing for cross-sectoral retaliation. EU member states widened the scope of the draft system for dispute resolution to include the future supplementary deals, as well as the powers to impose fines and freeze parts of the association agreement that Brussels wants to form the basis of the future trading agreement.† The commission has already said it will reserve the right to issue fines and suspend parts of the overarching legal framework for the future relationship if a UK-EU dispute escalates in an earlier draft of the EU negotiating mandate for trade talks.† ""The other Party would be entitled to request financial compensation or take proportionate and temporary measures, including suspension of its obligations within the scope of the envisaged partnership as well as any supplementing agreements,""ù a leaked draft of the revised negotiating mandate said.

While airline and freight connectivity is part of the EU's negotiating strategy for this year, the goal is a bare bones agreement, which would need to be fleshed out later.† EU diplomatic sources said that areas that could be ""plugged in""ù to the association agreement would include rules allowing UK airlines to land in†EU airports before travelling onto another non-EU destination.† Brexit meant the loss of cabotage rights to UK transport companies, meaning they cannot deliver freight between† or inside EU member states but only from the UK to a single EU member states and back.† EU governments moved to toughen demands over fisheries and the level playing field originally set out by the European Commission, which will lead negotiations for the EU.†† France appears to have suffered a setback in its bid to demand ""dynamic alignment""ù on all EU standards involving state aid, tax, the environment and social standards in return for the trade deal.† Dynamic alignment would mean UK law would change to mirror EU standards over time, despite Britain having no say in the drafting of the new rules.† Most member states agree with France that the commission should ask for tougher safeguards to prevent Britain gaining an unfair competitive advantage over the bloc by undercutting EU standards after Brexit.† Rather than demand total alignment, the current draft reads, ""these commitments should prevent distortions of trade and unfair competitive advantages over time to ensure a sustainable and long lasting relationship.""ù Some governments fear that failure to future-proof the new trade deal against regulatory changes in tax, the environment and social standards would not protect their businesses and mean the free trade deal would have to be renegotiated in the future.† But they also recognise that dynamic alignment is politically explosive in Britain and have told the commission to investigate ""mechanisms""ù that could allow UK standards to be updated to stay in date with those in the EU.† Boris Johnson has ruled out alignment on standards as part of the new trade deal, arguing countries such as Canada do not have to adhere to such stringent demands in their agreements with the EU.

The Premier League wants to keep the number of homegrown players at eight and be given license to recruit the remainder from anywhere in the world.

EU mulls carbon tariffs in climate trade war warning shot to Brexit Britain
",0,Neutral,"A new European Union carbon border tax could lead to tariffs being slapped on British imports of steel, cement and aluminium in a climate change trade war after Brexit. The tax will give the European Commission the power to impose levies of† imports on goods with a heavy carbon footprint. The tariff would target countries where the carbon emissions price is lower than in the EU. If Britain was to diverge too far from the EU's green policies, the trade defence measures would prove a powerful weapon as the EU toughens its global climate diplomacy. Energy intensive industries such as steel are likely to be targeted. Half of all UK steel exports are to the EU, which remains Britain's major trading partner. Sources in Brussels said the tax, which is in the early stages of drafting, was aimed principally at unfair competition from polluting non-EU countries such as the US, China and Russia. Experts said it was as yet undecided whether the levy would make up the difference in the carbon price or be much higher.† But diplomats admitted the plan could also be levelled against Britain, which left the EU on January 31. The tax is likely to gain support as a way of protecting European businesses after the commission launched its plan to cut the EU's net carbon emissions to zero by 2050.

Households could save billions from post-Brexit plan to slash tariffs
",0.5,Positive,"Ministers say they will reclaim Britain's mantle as the world's foremost free trade champion with a radical overhaul of tariffs. The Government has pledged to slash thousands of tariffs and strike deals with the US and other countries as the nation sets its own trade policy for the first time in almost 50 years. The Department of International Trade (DIT) is consulting on a new post-Brexit UK Global Tariff, cutting the cost of a swathe of goods ranging from fridges to bricks, burglar alarms and some food products. Many tariffs will fall sharply, with ""nuisance""ù charges of less than 2.5pc cut to zero in a bid to slash costs for families and manufacturers. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss promised radically simpler rules once the UK is free from the European Union's tariff system. This will replace the EU's Common External Tariff, which has long been criticised for its complexity and protectionism. For example, there are more than 13,000 different duties on 27 types of items classed as biscuits and confectionery under Brussels rules. The plans came alongside a move to open trade talks with the US. Ms Truss told Parliament that the UK will ""drive a hard bargain"" in its trade negotiations and is ""prepared to walk away if that is in the national interest"". She added: ""The UK has left the EU and it is time for us to look forward to our future as an independent, global champion of free trade. It is vitally important that we now move away from the complex tariff schedule imposed on us by the European Union. ""High tariffs impinge on businesses and raise costs for consumers. This is our opportunity to set our own tariff strategy that is right for UK consumers and businesses across our country.""ù Special arrangements would apply to goods entering Northern Ireland, she said.†† The DIT has launched a consultation on the new ""most favoured nation""ù tariff system, which will be enforced from 2021 and will apply to goods from other countries that do not currently have a trade deal with the UK. The Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), a Westminster think tank which endorses free markets,†expects households to make savings potentially amounting to billions of pounds as a result of lower taxes as the initial levy on goods cuts prices, and the economy responds to the injection of competition.

Albion, strongly indebted to Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard, remains the only play in recent years to properly probe the competing visions of Britain that make up our fractured isle. The absence of new works grappling with the seismic ramifications of Brexit is becoming deafening. Still, any chance to see Victoria Hamilton reprise her role as the savagely entertaining Audrey, who has put aside her London interiors business to restore the once famous gardens of a country house, is only to be welcomed. With more than a touch of the regal hauteur she deployed so magnificently as the Queen Mother in The Crown, she hauls her genially pliant husband Paul (a highly enjoyable Nicholas Rowe) and decidedly less pliant, ambitious publisher daughter Zara (cast newcomer Daisy Edgar-Jones) out of the metropolis and sets about asserting her inflexible vision of a lost Eden in chic wellies and cashmere coat with nary a thought for how that Eden might accommodate everyone else. Ferociously driven, frostily aloof, she's convinced that restoring an English idyll initially conceived as a garden of remembrance for the†Great War dead is for the good of the nation. Yet she fails to see that the two old duffers who have worked in the house and gardens for 20 years, the villagers who used to use the gardens for their annual fair, and Donal Finn's young Gabriel, a nervy, aspiring writer destined to end up working in Costa, are part of the very same rural England she's hell-bent on mythologising.

",0,Neutral,"When Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016 it felt to many observers that the bloc's economic and political foundations were crumbling before their eyes. The world's fifth-largest economy and the EU's dominant financial centre had decided to quit just as the 2015 immigration crisis provided fresh impetus to populist politicians the length and breadth of the continent. When Donald Trump won the White House the following November, the first question the new US president asked the European Council president Donald Tusk when he called to congratulate him on his victory was ""how Brexit is going and who is next in line to leave?""ù It wasn't just newly elected populist presidents who thought they could foresee the end of Europe as a coherent political entity; the renowned Bulgarian political scientist Ivan Krastev even wrote a best-seller on the subject gloomily titled After Europe. Four years later, the European Union has built a powerful counter-narrative to that story of imminent decline, arguing that Brexit has proved that their political construct is a great deal more durable than the ""òdoomsters', to borrow a phrase, had predicted. As it turned out, Emmanuel Macron, not Marine Le Pen was elected to the French Presidency in 2017 and as the UK found itself dithering and divided over what Brexit really meant, it was the other 27 EU states that successfully circled the wagons in the first phase of the negotiations. At same time, dirty deals with Turkey and Libya halted the flow of migrants into Europe, and after some grudging internal fudges in Brussels the lid was put back on the migrant crisis. Europe's east-west culture war, which had threatened to boil over, returned to a simmer.† At the same, despite a manufacturing recession in Germany and continued anaemic growth, the Eurozone plodded on, its own internal contradictions unresolved and its banking union incomplete but nowhere near the existential crisis eurosceptics have long predicted.† ",0.125,Positive

Letters:†Post-Brexit responsibility will improve the calibre of British politicians
",1,Positive,"SIR - I have immense respect for Dame Esther Rantzen and her work, but, in stating that Brexit is an ""act of national self-harm""ù (Letters, January 31), she is completely wrong. That view is still evident among a number of disappointed Remainers, and is symptomatic of the idea that the London elite knew best. In fact, given the right political climate, it is usually the general population that knows best: it is almost a form of natural selection at work. The woefully obstructive and ineffective performance of our MPs in recent years had its very genesis in our membership of the EU. With so many important decisions taken in Brussels, British MPs became emasculated, and there was little stimulation for great British politicians to emerge. Now that we have left the EU, and will be totally responsible for our own decisions, I anticipate that our politicians will sharpen their game; indeed, there are signs of that already. This will be good for the UK, but also for the wider world, which often looks to Britain (among others) for leadership. Serious international problems such as climate change or terrorism will be more effectively addressed by the concerted efforts of powerful democratic nations, including a re-energised UK. By contrast, I sadly expect the EU, hampered by the often divergent views of its 27 member states, to continue to prove unequal to dealing with issues and problems effectively. Peter de la Nougerede

The transition period was originally agreed with the expectation that it would come into force for a punctual Brexit from March 29 2019, lasting 21 months until the end of December 2020.

Boris Johnson tells Cabinet to go 'full steam ahead' in Britain's 'new chapter' in its history

The Prime Minister is expected to begin talks with Washington during a visit in February. On Friday the Cabinet discussed its plans to secure a Canada-style Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the EU.

All the remaining 27 EU member states and the European Parliament have to be in agreement before beginning the formal process.

The European states were democratic, I felt there was common cause between us, we had a shared interest in an enduring peace between us, and nationalism seemed an unmitigated evil, especially when combined with an ideology. My own comfort gradually disappeared as it became clearer that our lives were increasingly being shaped by officials whom we had not elected. We had joined the ""Common Market""ù and been told that it was all about free trade, which always sounds like a good thing.† Half the Labour Party was opposed to it, however.

In the UK,†Brexit-day front pages expressed both joy at the country's imminent departure from the European Union and remorse and trepidation. Here's how Europe's media reacted as Brexit Day arrived and†the UK prepares to go it alone after nearly half a century as part of the bloc. Across the Channel, Aujourd'hui en France dedicates its first seven pages to Brexit, calling it a ""historic divorce"" and has interviews with French citizens living in the UK who are ""between weariness and worry"" at what might happen next.

The 20 funniest moments of Brexit†
",0,Neutral,"A month before the referendum, Nigel Farage issued a stern warning: if his side lost narrowly, he would still carry on campaigning for the outcome he wanted. ""In a 52-48 referendum,""ù he declared, ""this would be unfinished business by a long way.""ù In other words: he wouldn't accept the result, or respect the will of the people. Instead, he would insist that the public keep on voting, until he got the result he wanted. As it turned out, of course, the result was 52-48 the other way. At which point, he decided that the will of the people must be respected after all. When John Bercow announced his decision both to retire as Speaker and quit Parliament, many Brexiteers were delighted. They were slightly less amused, however, by the Niagara-like gushing that followed. On September 12,†the day he made his announcement, an hour and a half of Commons time was taken up with damp-eyed eulogies; and on October 31, his final day in the chair, there came†another three hours of them. One MP - Richard Harrington (Con, Watford) - even told the Commons that his mother keeps ""a large photograph""ù of Mr Bercow on her mantelpiece, and ""continually""ù asks her son: ""Why can't you be like John Bercow?""ù Presumably she isn't referring to†the bullying allegations.

How Boris got Brexit done: Three years of bust-ups, backstabbing, tears and turmoil
",-0.375,Negative,"When Britain woke to the news that the country had made a historic decision to leave the European Union, very few people could have predicted just how difficult and tortuous the mere act of departure would become. While Nigel Farage jubilantly declared June 23 2016 as ""òIndependence Day', it was ironically Boris Johnson's rather ashen face, caught on camera immediately after the result became clear, that hinted at the profound changes that the ""òvote to leave' actually portended. ""òBrexit means Brexit', said Theresa May as she succeeded David Cameron, but the calculated vacuity of that phrase only served to highlight, not conceal, the Brexit battles that lay ahead - both with the European Union, but even more importantly, within the British body politic itself. Over the last three years and seven months, the UK has collectively spent many tens of thousands of hours and countless millions of words collectively arguing over what kind of Brexit the country should pursue. And yet, thanks to the accident of history that left a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - a border that would become an external EU frontier on Brexit Day - there only ever were two possible outcomes from the UK's decision to leave the EU. As soon as Mrs May declared that the UK's intention to take back control of its money, laws and borders by leaving the EU's customs union and single market - all while not putting a hard border back in Northern Ireland - the country was presented with a clear choice. Either the UK left Northern Ireland behind in a kind of ""òspecial status' with the EU that avoided the need for border controls - or the entire UK adopted that same, closer relationship so the entire UK could Brexit together. In truth, there never was anything much in between. The story of the Brexit process is therefore actually the story of how the British government and the Conservative Party came to decide between these two conflicting outcomes. ",0,Neutral

UK must come to terms with being a 'small country' after Brexit, says Leo Varadkar

The Taoiseach's comments, which come before trade talks begin in March, appeared to be deliberately provocative in a week which will end with Britain celebrating its new-found freedom from the EU. One former Brexit minister suggested he would serve the Irish people by trying to ""work in harmony""ù with Ireland's biggest trading partner ""rather than trying to provoke it""ù. It came as Downing Street announced that ministers would be bypassed in the Brexit trade negotiations, with a team of civil servants called Taskforce Europe, headed by Mr Johnson's chief Brexit adviser David Frost, carrying out the talks. It means there will be no role for the International Trade Secretary Liz Truss, raising question marks about her future ahead of an impending Cabinet reshuffle.

""We hope it works out for them. But if it does not, there will always be a seat kept for them at the table."" David Jones, the former Brexit minister, said: ""He is saying that for a domestic audience, because he has an election coming up, but the fact is that Ireland shares far more with Britain than it does with continental Europe. ""Rather than trying to provoke its most important trading partner, it would do well to work in harmony with it.""ù Speaking in London, Mr Johnson again insisted it should be possible to ""wrap all this up"" by the end of the year. He said: ""We will be doing things very fast, (in a) very friendly and respectful way, and in a way also, I think it's important to stress, that really ensures we look after the interests of the Republic of Ireland as well.""ù Downing Street confirmed on Monday that Steve Barclay, the Brexit Secretary, will be out of a Government job on Friday night, as his department will be abolished as soon as Britain leaves the EU at 11pm. He will have to wait for a reshuffle expected within days of Brexit to find out if Mr Johnson has another ministerial role for him. Liz Truss, the International Trade Secretary, will play no part in the Brexit negotiations after Number 10 said Mr Frost would be in charge of the Taskforce Europe team of negotiators, reporting directly to the Prime Minister. A source close to Ms Truss said: ""This was always the plan, that DIT would concentrate on the rest of the world while David Frost dealt with the EU.""ù Mr Barnier said in a speech in Belfast that he hoped Britain was ""reflecting carefully"" on how much it wanted to diverge from EU standards, because it was central to defining the future trading relationship. Separately, Brussels reaffirmed its intention for the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to enforce regulations on fishing, trade and security after Brexit. Downing Street insisted that the ECJ could not be a neutral arbiter, but an internal Brussels memo called for the court to be involved to try to ""secure consistent interpretation"" of a deal.

The EU has warned that successfully concluding a fishing deal with the UK - ideally by July 1 this year - is a prerequisite for any future trade deal, which Mr Johnson wants done by the end of this year. Britain is understood to be willing to accept only a one-year agreement on quotas and fishing rights, setting up the first big showdown of negotiations that will start in March. On a day of huge ceremonial significance, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission President, and Charles Michel, the European Council President, signed the Withdrawal Agreement document in the same room in Brussels in which Britain's permanent representative to the EU handed over Theresa May's letter triggering Article 50 almost three years ago.

Secondly, every judicial appointee should have been in full-time practice as a barrister or solicitor for a significant and set number of years before being appointed to any office. Thirdly, a law degree should cover only core subjects such as criminal and contract law. Other politicised topics - for example, criminology and diversity law - should only be studied as part of a graduate degree or for the professional qualification. I suspect that the present problems have deep roots and in some cases go back to politically motivated teaching at universities. My suggestions might not eradicate all such problems but they would deal with some. His Honour Judge Nicholas Webb Birmingham † ",0,Neutral

Britain's economic growth to take off in 2020 - once final Brexit deal is complete
",0,Neutral,"Economic growth is set to take off from almost nothing in the final few months of this year to a solid rate at the end of 2020 and potentially a faster pace in the years ahead once the final Brexit deal is complete. However, a sharp boom is unlikely as businesses and traders await full details of the post-Brexit deal with the EU, preparing the way for a pickup in growth in 2021 and beyond. The new year should get an immediate boost from extra government spending, firstly on day-to-day consumption and then on investment once more money is ploughed into infrastructure, analysts predict. Paul Dales at Capital Economics estimates this could drag the quarterly growth rate up from as little as zero in the final three months of 2019 to 0.5pc by the fourth quarter of 2020.

How a hung parliament could lead to a 2020 general election
",0.125,Positive,"The polls were tightening in the general election and CCHQ were nervous. Britain's electoral system means that, even with a substantial Tory lead, a hung parliament was entirely possible. So what happens if Boris Johnson's gamble fails? Where does Britain end up next and who heads into Downing Street?† There are multiple potential outcomes, but only one that seems fairly certain not to happen: a formal coalition. 2010 was unusual in producing a stable and long-lasting coalition. It's highly unlikely that whatever government emerges over the coming days will take such a form. In all likelihood - barring an extraordinary failure of the polls - the Conservatives will win a substantial majority. In a hung parliament, the variables that matter are how many seats the SNP, the Liberal Democrats and the DUP can take. The received wisdom is that in a hung parliament Jeremy Corbyn will be in the better position by default, regardless of whether Mr Johnson has won more seats. The logic being that he has more potential allies in the Commons. The Tories might have the most seats, but the DUP are the only other explicitly pro-Brexit party and Mr Johnson burnt that bridge and blasted the ashes into space when he betrayed the party to secure his Brexit deal.

Brexit: what could it mean for your savings?
",0.5,Positive,"Britain is careering ever closer towards to a complete withdrawal from the European Union. On December 31 2020 the transition period, during which British banks and financial firms have continued to operate under European rules, will end.† This has temporarily held off any significant Brexit-related changes for savers, who have instead been battered by interest rate cuts following the coronavirus outbreak. Ministers had hoped to reach an agreement on what future relations with Europe would look like by now but the prospect of a ""no-deal""†is still very real.† Economic disruption caused by a no-deal Brexit could pile more pressure on already squeezed banks, forcing savings rates down. Interest rates have already fallen this year after the Bank of England slashed its base rate twice in March 2020 to a record low level of just 0.1pc. Further cuts could push rates into negative territory, meaning savers could end up having to pay banks to look after their cash. Even now there is only one easy-access account on the market that beats inflation and savers are already struggling to protect their cash from losing value. Rachel Springall of Moneyfacts, a data provider, warned that Brexit could also lead some financial firms without a British banking licence to leave the savings market entirely. ""That would be bad for competition and could push rates down further,""ù she said. ""As it stands the Government is prioritising support for people impacted by coronavirus and in the upcoming Budget the focus may be on potential tax hikes to pay off some of the deficit rather than supporting savers.""ù Anna Bowes of Savings Champion, a comparison site, said: ""It's impossible to know what will happen with savings rates due to the current pandemic - never mind with the approaching date for Brexit.""ù She added that rates had recovered slightly in recent weeks and savers may therefore want to lock away their money in case this trend is reversed following a disorderly exit from the EU.† The best three and five-year fixed-rate bonds are with the bank UBL UK.

With the second round of negotiations due to commence in the fourth week of September, Ms Truss will hail a trade deal with Australia as a ""critical step""ù to fulfilling the UK's ambition of joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).† The trade bloc, comprising 11 nations including Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, accounts for 13 per cent of global commerce, with 95 per cent of goods traded between members tariff-free. † The UK is said to be particularly drawn to the bloc due to huge growth potential as well its high standards in areas such as digital and data.† On Saturday night Ms Truss said: ""We want a gold standard deal with Australia that pushes new frontiers in trade and delivers for the whole country.† ""We are intensifying talks over the next few weeks, and fighting hard for British interests in areas like financial services, telecoms, tech, and food and drink. ""Together with our great friend Australia, we will stand up for rules-based free trade and help advance it globally. Strategically, a deal is an important step towards British membership of the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) - which will open up new opportunities for our †businesses and hitch Britain to one of the world's biggest free trade areas.""ù The UK intends to secure zero-tariffs on UK exports including whisky, gin, sausages and cars, currently set at five per cent, as well as simplifying customs processes, and making it easier for professional and financial services companies to operate in Australia.† The Government believes the deal would boost the UK economy by £500m, increase UK wages by £400m, and drive up exports by £900m in the long-term.

UK sets October deadline for post-Brexit trade deal as Michel Barnier warns agreement 'unlikely'

David Frost, Britain's chief negotiator, said a deal could still be reached if the EU was prepared to give ground - but Mr Barnier said Britain's current position was ""completely unacceptable"" to Brussels. Government figures had previously suggested that Mr Johnson could walk away from the talks if there was no outline agreement by the end of this month.

Free ports: post-Brexit triumph or the emperor's new clothes?
",1.125,Positive,"Typically of a government led by an admirer of the ancient world, its consultation paper on free ports opened with a classical image: ""Greek and Roman ships, piled high with traders'†wines and olive oils, found safe harbour in the freeport of Delos, a small Greek island in the waters of the Aegean. ""Offering respite from import taxes in the hope of attracting the patronage of merchants, the Delosian model of a freeport has rarely been out of use since."" The idea of free ports has†been dormant in Britain, however. since the seven created from 1984 to 2012 were quietly dropped by David Cameron. Now it is being revived as a central plank of the Johnson government's twin strategies to ""level up""†left-behind regions and boost ""Global Britain""†post-Brexit. A consultation on the policy, which was extended due to Covid-19, closed last week. The towns, ≠cities and regions to become free ports will be announced in the Chancellor's autumn Budget and are expected to be fully operational within 18 months of the UK leaving the customs union and single market at the end of this year. It helps that, as a backbencher, Rishi Sunak put his name to a 2016 paper by the conservative†Centre for Policy Studies think tank, which advocated for free trade zones as opportunities to ""increase manufacturing output, create employment regionally where it is most needed and promote trade"". According to the British Ports Association, more than 30 ports are interested in being selected to be one of up to 10 sites into which goods can enter with zero tariff, be manufactured to add value, then leave for export or enter the domestic market.† ",-1,Negative

Subsidies to help firms in Northern Ireland cope with post-Brexit red tape
",0.5,Positive,"Firms in Northern Ireland could get direct subsidies from the taxpayer to prevent them from collapsing under a deluge of Brexit customs red tape, The Telegraph has learned.

It comes in addition to the £50m fund for companies across the UK to help train staff in customs skills and to upgrade their IT systems to be compatible with the Goods Vehicle Movement Service (GVMS), HMRC's own new platform, ahead of the end of the transition period at the end of the year. The Northern Ireland Retail Consortium had expressed concern that some businesses may struggle to deal with the complexity of the new system, which requires them to enter goods' safety, security, transit and export declarations to generate a single code. The ""goods movement reference""ù would then be submitted by lorry drivers before arriving at ports to prevent queues. A survey by the Institute of Directors†in January also found that 41pc of about 1,000 members trade goods across the Irish Sea. Of those, almost two thirds said new costs, paperwork and delays to trade would have a negative impact on their business and 34pc said they would change their commercial terms with suppliers to compensate.† The new scheme is intended to address this by funding businesses to hire intermediaries to complete the electronic paperwork on their behalf. However, John Martin, Northern Ireland policy manager of the Road Haulage Association, warned the system would be open to abuse if intermediaries in turn increased their rates. ",-0.125,Negative

CBI goes back to basics with new boss Tony Danker after years of Brexit wrangling
",0.25,Positive,"Tony Danker took a gamble when he left his established media industry career†to head up a business ""òmovement' back in 2017.

Morrissey, I Am Not a Dog on a Chain, review: as great as anything he has ever written
",0.125,Positive,"I do not read newspapers/ They are troublemakers,""ù Morrissey croons on the title track of his 13th solo album, I Am Not a Dog on†a Chain. I guess he won't be perusing the pages of The Telegraph to see how many stars have been awarded to his latest offering. Yet you don't have to agree with his views on the media to applaud the passion with which he expresses them. What starts out like a sweet nursery-rhyme ditty builds to a spluttering explosion of†righteous rage: ""I raise my voice/ I have no choice/ I raise my hand, I hammer twice/ I see no point in being nice.""ù It is bracing stuff, beautifully delivered. At the age of 60, he is still making music as if his life depended upon it. The underlying assertion of the†album title, of course, is Morrissey's right to express himself as he sees fit, and damn the†begrudgers. His support for Right-wing political causes has created tension with fans who idealised his Eighties indie band the Smiths as liberal champions of the oppressed. Yet a streak of politically incorrect provocation has existed in Morrissey's work since his earliest days and there is a†suspicion that what might have seemed iconoclastic in a young man has come to be viewed as misanthropic for a mature artist. Perhaps one of the reasons Morrissey gets into trouble is that he dares to embrace subjects rarely tackled in pop music. There are songs here that touch on: suicide (Jim Jim Falls); transsexualism (The Truth About Ruth); chastity (Darling, I Hug a Pillow); political despair (Love Is on Its Way Out); repressed homosexuality (Bobby, Don't You Think They Know?); deeply personal family memories (I Saw the River Clean); and music as an antidote to depression (The Secret of Music). It is an album bursting with epigrammatic phrases, ridiculous rhymes, huge melodies and provocative opinions. The sound is brash and arresting. American producer Joe Chiccarelli (with whom Morrissey has worked since 2015) dials up the electronica, fusing synths with more familiar gothic rock and baroque elements, while Morrissey's assured, inimitable voice glides airily above the mayhem. Knockabout World is an anthem for the bullied that ends with a cheerful singalong of ""You're OK by me!""ù Yet he can switch from empathetic humanity to the mean-spirited trolling of What Kind of People Live in These Houses?, a jangling guitar romp delivered with the sneery judgmentalism of†an angry prig (""What carpet chewer lights up this sewer?/ What dented gent bends over in this tent?""ù). Morrissey remains a deeply complicated character, parading his brittle psychology in song; you don't have to like everything he creates to respect such absolute commitment to his art. The album ends beautifully with My Hurling Days Are Done, a song as great as any he has ever written. ""Time is no friend of mine,""ù he sings, sadly. Erstwhile fans who might prefer Morrissey to shut up and go away should be careful what they wish for. I†Am Not a Dog on a Chain is†released by†BMG on March 20 ",-0.375,Negative

Coronavirus shows future access post-Brexit to the EU's health security system remains vital†
",0.875,Positive,"As the number of cases of coronavirus in the UK passed 51, the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, addressed the nation from 10 Downing Street. He set out some fairly gloomy possibilities. The coronavirus could mean that up to a fifth of workers will be off work at the same time. People may be expected to stay at home, avoiding workplaces and anywhere else that people congregate in large numbers. Non-urgent hospital appointments could be delayed and the emergency services will only respond to the most serious problems. If the incidence of infection continues to grow, the police may be required to maintain public order and the military may be called in to support the NHS and emergency services. All this is occurring just as UK has left the EU. The emergence of the latest coronavirus, now named 2019-nCoV, began with reports by health authorities in Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019, of a cluster of cases of pneumonia. Its subsequent spread to every continent (except Antarctica) serves as a reminder, if one is needed, that viruses and bacteria do not respect national boundaries. Closer to home, a woman who travelled by plane from northern Italy, via Dublin, to Belfast was confirmed as the first case in Northern Ireland. Passengers sitting close to her on the flight were contacted, by now dispersed across the island of Ireland. The permeability of borders - particularly along the UK's only land border with the EU - highlights the necessity of cross-border cooperation and coordination when faced with an outbreak. Yet, incredibly, the UK government effectively plans to self-isolate from the EU-wide Early Warning and Response System (EWRS), a critical link in the UK's preparedness and response to the coronavirus.

Free ports: will investment drivers for 'Global Britain' secure the Tories' new northern strongholds?
",0.375,Positive,"Little known Shannon Airport on the west coast of Ireland unknowingly started a trade revolution back in 1959 when it became the world's first free trade zone. Skip forward six decades and Brexiteers are holding up this small town in County Clare as a symbol of the opportunities the UK's new-found freedom could offer. The Government on Monday†kicked off a 10-week consultation on plans to create up to 10 free ports as it looks to level up the UK economy and attract investment into post-industrial coastal areas. After the success in Shannon, they have been used across the world to create global trading hubs in Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai. ""You cannot do the proper free ports we're talking about inside the European Union,""ù says Ben Houchen, Tees Valley Mayor and a member of the Government's Free Ports advisory panel. He believes the benefits of Shannon's transformative free port were gradually eroded by Ireland's membership of the EU. ""Look at what happened at Shannon Airport. They joined the European Union and were allowed to keep it and then if you look over time because of their membership of the single market, state-aid laws and the customs union that's been eroded. ""They had a zero percent corporate tax when Shannon was first set up, it's now back to the Irish average of 12pc.""ù The basic principle of a free port is an area where goods do not face a tariff or other taxes typically slapped on imports. This means goods can be shipped in without facing a tariff, made into higher value products before being exported again. The Government hopes this idea can lure much-needed investment into deprived coastal areas and create thousands of jobs. ",-0.625,Negative

Coronavirus will dampen 'Boris bounce', economists warn
",0.125,Positive,"The ""Boris bounce""ù will be dampened by the disruption caused to the global economy from the coronavirus outbreak, economists have warned.

The coronavirus could cost the world economy more than $280bn in the first quarter and break a 43-quarter growth streak, predicted Simon MacAdam, economist at Capital Economics. The impact to growth will depend on when the virus is contained and how quick Beijing relax the lockdowns paralysing business in parts of the country, he said.†""Assuming the economic disruption comes to an end soon, the coronavirus will probably end up just delaying the global economic recovery in 2020, rather than cancelling it altogether.""ù Goldman predicted that the first quarter blip would cause annual growth in the UK to reach an anaemic 1pc.

Britain handed £1 billion bill by European Commission on Brexit Day
",0.5,Positive,"The European Commission has issued Britain with a bill for £1.09†billion on the very evening that it finally left the EU. Every year Brussels recalculates the contributions member states make to the EU Budget. This year, due to an increase in Gross National Income and VAT contributions, EU officials believe Britain owes an extra Ç¨1.3†billion. The demand for payment was sent to the UK embassy to the EU and has been notified to the British government. EU sources said the bill was for the period of 2019-20. Britain's payment to Brussels for 2019 was nearly £9billion pounds. If the figure is similar in 2020, it could mean Britain pays†up to £10billion in what could be its final†payment to the EU Budget. The†bill will only add weight to Brexiteers' argument that Britain is right to leave the EU because it is effectively being punished for the strength of its economy with demands for more cash to be sent to Brussels. Britain gets a rebate on its EU budget payments. The amount for the rebate, which was secured by Margaret Thatcher, is revised according to EU economic data. Sources believe the £1.09billion bill could be halved once those revisions take effect. In 2018, the budget rebate was worth about £4billion, meaning the final bill was around £9billion rather than £13 billion. ""This bill will come down in negotiations. But the point is that we need to be in control of our own money. That's why we're leaving, "" said a UK government source.

Brexit: what could it mean for your savings?
",0.5,Positive,"Britain is careering ever closer towards to a complete withdrawal from the European Union. On December 31 2020 the transition period, during which British banks and financial firms have continued to operate under European rules, will end.† This has temporarily held off any significant Brexit-related changes for savers, who have instead been battered by interest rate cuts following the coronavirus outbreak. Ministers had hoped to reach an agreement on what future relations with Europe would look like by now but the prospect of a ""no-deal""†is still very real.† Economic disruption caused by a no-deal Brexit could pile more pressure on already squeezed banks, forcing savings rates down. Interest rates have already fallen this year after the Bank of England slashed its base rate twice in March 2020 to a record low level of just 0.1pc. Further cuts could push rates into negative territory, meaning savers could end up having to pay banks to look after their cash. Even now there is only one easy-access account on the market that beats inflation and savers are already struggling to protect their cash from losing value. Rachel Springall of Moneyfacts, a data provider, warned that Brexit could also lead some financial firms without a British banking licence to leave the savings market entirely. ""That would be bad for competition and could push rates down further,""ù she said. ""As it stands the Government is prioritising support for people impacted by coronavirus and in the upcoming Budget the focus may be on potential tax hikes to pay off some of the deficit rather than supporting savers.""ù Anna Bowes of Savings Champion, a comparison site, said: ""It's impossible to know what will happen with savings rates due to the current pandemic - never mind with the approaching date for Brexit.""ù She added that rates had recovered slightly in recent weeks and savers may therefore want to lock away their money in case this trend is reversed following a disorderly exit from the EU.† The best three and five-year fixed-rate bonds are with the bank UBL UK. The former pays 1.4pc while the latter pays 1.5pc. Paragon Bank pays the next best rates on both of these terms.

Plan your own Brexit: The 10 easiest countries for securing EU residency
",0.375,Positive,"Britain might be leaving the EU imminently - but that doesn't mean you have to. Various countries on the continent have programmes that allow foreign citizens to invest their way to residency. So where best to buy into? A study by the citizenship consultancy firm Henley & Partners analysed various programmes around the world, ranking them by value and quality, among other metrics. Here are the 10 European nations that performed best overall. Warning: you'll need to have plenty of spare cash to gain residency in most of these places. But these permits allow visa-free travel across the Schengen Area, which includes most EU nations. Topping the list is Austria, which, according to Henley & Partners is ""one of the most attractive countries in the world; an ideal combination of economic stability, a clean and safe environment, and an excellent infrastructure."" It offers a number of residence and citizenship permits, including a non-work related one for ""persons of independent means"" provided you have liquid assets worth at least Ç¨40,000 (£33,760) and a university degree.† Vienna, its capital, has also been ranked by Mercer as the world's most liveable city nine years in a row. Take a look at our†expert guide to a weekend in Vienna. The minimum you can get away with in Portugal, one of the oldest countries in Europe, is Ç¨500,000 (£450,000); buy a house for that price and you're in. Alternatively, transfer Ç¨1 million (£846,000) into a Portuguese bank account or create 10 jobs in the country.† The regions are distinctive, each having their own architecture, cuisine and wine. Curious? Here are 10 amazing ways to explore Portugal. Invest, invest, invest. Italy's latest visa program, which launched in 2017, requires that you either put Ç¨2 million (£1.6 million) into government bonds, donate Ç¨1 million to a philanthropic cause, invest Ç¨1 million in a private limited company, or, the budget option: a Ç¨500,000 investment into an ""innovative"" Italian start-up. Italy is also well known for its rural regeneration drives, whereby homes in ghost town villages†are sold for as little as Ç¨1. Low tax rates (permanent residents pay just 15 per cent) and a sunny climate make Malta an attractive destination for those seeking EU citizenship. Buying a Ç¨275,000 (£232,000) property is enough to get your foot in the door. And could this country be Europe's most underrated culinary destination? Our expert thinks so. Easy peasy. Here, merely securing a job in Belgium can be enough to qualify for residency, thus negating the need to invest. The process is on a case-by-case basis and takes from three months to complete. Fancy a visit? Don't make like the masses and head to Bruges, says Chris Leadbeater - who has unearthed†10 surprising travel options in Belgium. Get a job offer from a Swiss employer and you're in, provided you can prove you are ""indispensable"". Otherwise, you simply have to show that you're financially independent with sufficient income or wealth to cover your living costs. This figure varies hugely (it's a complex system) but you can be sure it's high. Zurich is also currently ranked the second best city to live in by Mercer; stylish, thriving and very clean. A country crying out for investment, Greece offers residency to anyone purchasing properties with a total value of at least Ç¨250,000 (£211,000), which can get you a nice little bolthole somewhere hot. And you don't even need to live there full time; subletting is allowed, as are timeshares. This visa also allows the owner to establish a Greek business. Very attractive indeed. Take the test: Which is the right Greek island for you? Like neighbouring Portugal, resident permits for Spain can be obtained by purchasing a house worth Ç¨500,000, which will get you a lot of bricks and mortar in some parts of the country. Alternatively, aspiring residents could opt to invest Ç¨2 million in government debt. See our pick of the†14 best places to visit in Spain - and where to stay. Property again, this time to the tune of Ç¨250,000 (plus a five per cent government fee), which should be enough to get you a temporary residence permit. Like forests? You'll be spoiled in Latvia, nearly half of which is covered in trees. Here are another†25 amazing things you probably didn't know about Latvia. As well as benefiting from visa-free travel across the Schengen Area, residents of Monaco are not obliged to pay income tax, capital gains tax or wealth tax. To secure residency foreigners must deposit a minimum of Ç¨500,000 into a bank account, which must stay with the bank during the residency period. What is it like to live there?

Pound endures worst week since March as Brexit trade talks falter
",-0.75,Negative,"Investors are racing to insure themselves against a plunge in sterling as fractious Brexit trade talks with the European Union threaten to collapse. The pound has endured its worst week since the onset of the coronavirus crisis in March, falling 3.5pc amid fears of a cliff-edge end to the transition period, which expires on Dec 31. Currency experts said the biggest moves had been seen in sterling options expiring at the end of the year after a potential failure to agree a deal before October's summit or any last-ditch effort in November. Jordan Rochester, a currency analyst at Nomura, said the price of hedging against the pound moving in either direction, known as implied volatility, ""has risen to levels only seen during periods of Brexit stress or Covid-19 market madness""ù. He added the market focus had ""shifted very much to hedging in the event of further falls in the pound""ù, with the price of options to sell at a guaranteed price now at levels seen in previous periods of Brexit turmoil in late 2018 and October 2019. Erik Norland, the chief economist at derivatives exchange CME, said data from the group's $82bn (£64bn) a day currency options market signalled traders hunting ""downside protection""ù in November and December. He added: ""We can see that investors are clearly concerned that much larger movements could be in store.""ù The rush for protection comes as experts warn the pound will sink to $1.20 against the dollar and close to parity against the euro after a no-deal Brexit. The currency could also be buffeted by the ratings agencies this autumn as Moody's is poised to review its sovereign rating for Britain immediately after the October summit. In July the company warned ""departure from the EU without a deal would be strongly credit negative""ù. The Chancellor's ""eat out to help out""ù initiative is meanwhile set to drag inflation to just 0.3pc, its lowest since January 2016, while the Bank of England holds interest rates at their all-time low of 0.1pc. But members of the Bank's rate-setting committee, including Michael Saunders, have voiced their unease at darkening prospects.

Should investors 'buy, hold or fold' Edinburgh Investment Trust after Mark Barnett's dismissal?
",-0.375,Negative,"Fund manager Mark Barnett has been sacked from running the £1.3bn Edinburgh Investment Trust leaving thousands of investors with a decision on what to do with their money. Invesco Perpetual's Mr Barnett took over from former colleague Neil Woodford in 2014. Next year the trust will be handed to James de Uphaugh of Majedie Asset Management. The portfolio currently consists of ""value""ù stocks - cheap British companies believed to be undervalued but provide a growing dividend. This style of investing has been out of favour for some time. Mr Barnett has also relied on smaller companies, whose fortunes are heavily reliant on the British economy. These have suffered heavily since the Brexit referendum due to economic uncertainty. Mr de Uphaugh runs three funds at Majedie with a similar value style and, like Mr Barnett, has failed to beat the British market over the past five years. This leaves investors with a conundrum.

Exclusive: British fishermen unprepared to take full advantage of extra quota when UK reclaims its waters, Scottish Tory leader says
",-1,Negative,"British fishermen are not ready to take full advantage of the additional stocks the country stands to reclaim from the EU, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives has said. In an interview with The Telegraph, Douglas Ross said the UK's fishing industry did not yet have the ""capacity"" to reap the full benefits of leaving the Common Fisheries Policy at the end of this year. Mr Ross's remarks came after Nigel Farage accused Boris Johnson of ""backing down"" on fish in the post-Brexit trade talks. On Sunday, Mr Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president agreed to ""intensify"" negotiations this week. In a joint statement the two sides said that ""progress had been made in recent weeks"" but that ""significant gaps remained"", including on the issue of fishing rights in UK waters. Mr Johnson is understood to have insisted that the UK was prepared to end the post-Brexit transition period without a formal trade agreement, as he warned that time was short to agree a deal. The UK has said it needs ""clarity"" by Oct 15 on whether a deal is possible. Last week it emerged that the UK had proposed a new three-year transition period for fisheries, in a bid to help unlock the talks.

The constantly capitulating Tories have no one to blame but themselves for their Brexit woes

But then suddenly, even the Tories realise that for all the aforesaid reasons #CapitulationThree might not actually be a victory after all so they devise the Internal Market Bill which they now say is a real victory because it gets rid of the last victory.† The problem is, mainly due to a large contingent of Remainers voicing outrage at the prospect of anyone other than the EU being allowed to break international law, the bill proves deeply controversial. So the Tories hammer out #CapitulationFour by conspiring to delay the Internal Market Bill's Lords readings and giving Parliament a veto on preserving #CapitulationThree even though #CapitulationOne and #CapitulationTwo were only ever agreed to because the May government said that #CapitulationThree would be a capitulation too far.† Still with me?

Given the EU's bad faith, it cannot bring to heel a sovereign Britain
",-0.75,Negative,"There are good arguments that the Government's clauses will not breach international law, contrary to the EU's contentions. First, the clauses as such do not breach anything. Even if passed into law, they simply authorise action in the future. Second, there is a general principle of international law that treaty powers should be exercised in good faith. The EU's blocking of†reasonable†""goods at risk""ù rules, threatening to use†treaty machinery to impose tariffs on trade between Britain and Northern Ireland,†could be classed as a bad faith exercise of treaty powers. The Government's clauses, in turn, would allow the UK to protect itself from abusive exercise of treaty powers by the EU and on that basis can be justified under international law. Third, the Government would be acting in defence of a fundamental aspect of the United Kingdom's constitution which is built upon internal free trade between the different parts of the UK. However there is a problem. When the UK was an EU member, the ECJ was a multi-national court in which the UK participated - helping to†frame†its rules, and†appoint†a judge and an Advocate General. After we ceased to be an EU member in February, it became an entirely foreign court which owes its allegiance wholly to the EU, and none whatsoever†to an ex-member state like the UK. Under universal international treaty practice, sovereign states simply do not subject themselves to binding rulings by the courts of another treaty party. They insist on strictly neutral adjudication. But not so in Theresa May's atrociously negotiated Withdrawal Agreement. She accepted clauses giving wide ranging and long term jurisdiction over the UK to a wholly foreign court, in complete disregard for normal international treaty practice. Boris Johnson in his renegotiation was unable to remove these clauses. This is now about to become not a chicken but rather a giant flying ostrich coming home to roost. This is because the Northern Ireland Protocol says that the ECJ and the EU Commission have direct jurisdiction over the parts of the Protocol to which the government's clause would apply. Practising lawyers have to learn early in our careers that clients need to be told what the actual court which will deal with their case will decide, rather than what we think in theory it ought to decide. We assess the chances of the ECJ accepting a UK government argument that its clauses are justified under international law as somewhere between 0 per cent†and a snowflake's chance in a very hot place. This means that the government must get ready for the next step, which is how it would deal with an adverse ECJ ruling. Two things can be said. First, there is no actual means by which an ECJ judgment can be enforced against a sovereign state which defies it. Secondly, there are credible international law arguments that the UK's obligations under the WA and its Protocol as a whole - including the egregious and one-sided ECJ jurisdiction clauses - have been vitiated by the EU's bad faith behaviour over the course of the negotiations. What happens ultimately will be decided by the political reality. Martin Howe QC and Clive Thorne are chairman and vice-chairman of Lawyers for Britain ",1,Positive

Fur sales face post-Brexit ban under ministers' proposals

State visit secrets: Why only a bed at Buckingham Palace would do when Donald Trump came to the UK

The offer, passed on by Theresa May during her Washington visit, was considered a masterstroke in Whitehall, playing to the new US president's love of royalty inherited from his Scottish mother Mary, born on the Isle of Lewis. But as months turned to years without taking place the trip had morphed from the crowning glory of the renewed special relationship to an albatross around its necks. The prospect of a hostile British public, inevitable protests and the possibility of Mr Trump reacting to both had, White House sources believed, resulted in the UK dragging its heels. Now though, in the summer of 2019 - some two and a half years after the invitation was made - the state visit was on. There was, however, a snag. † As planning for the trip intensified, the White House aides repeatedly pressed upon their Downing Street colleagues that one element was apparently critically important - a stay in Buckingham Palace.

Global Britain urged to open doors for developing world

In a new report, James Sproule calls on Mr Johnson to allow a new generation of start-ups to operate within UK company law from abroad - beginning with Commonwealth countries such as Nigeria, Uganda and Zambia.  The report, published by the Centre for Policy Studies think tank, says the move would help entrepreneurs in developing countries to draw investment to countries where the ""start-up spirit"" is currently ""stifled"", including, in some cases, by corruption and maladministration. It would also give British investors an opportunity to gain the ""higher returns"" available in developing countries, knowing that their investments would be protected by UK law, Mr Sproule states. Speaking earlier this year, Mr Johnson said that Brexit gave the UK the opportunity to ""go ... out into the world"", adding that free trade ""has done more than any other single economic idea to raise billions out of poverty and incredibly fast."" Mr Sproule, who is now †UK Chief Economist at Sweden's Handelsbanken, said his proposals were intended to ""help flesh out that vision"" by putting the UK ""at the heart of the global trade in services ideas"" and supporting entrepreneurship across the world. Under the proposals, the UK would introduce ""e-citizenship"" akin to a scheme set up in Estonia in 2014 to allow entrepreneurs to set up Estonian firms from anywhere in the world. The scheme was originally targeted at nearby countries where red tape and problems with the rule of law acted as impediments to those seeking to set up new firms. The criteria for e-citizenship would be more stringent than for a business visa application, allowing those who are approved to also qualify for working visas. E-citizens would be able to set up UK-registered ""e-businesses"" and open an international British bank account, under the report's proposals.

Britain close to abandoning hope of Brexit trade deal
",-0.25,Negative,"Ministers now believe that Britain and the EU will fail to sign a post-Brexit trade deal, with just days remaining until Boris Johnson's July deadline for an outline agreement passes. The Telegraph has learnt that the Government's central working assumption is that Britain will trade with Europe on World Trade Organisation terms when the transition period ends on December 31. UK and EU negotiators began the latest round of negotiations in London on Monday,†but remain deadlocked on the stumbling blocks of fishing rights, so-called ""level playing field"" guarantees, governance of the deal and the role of the European Court of Justice. Senior sources said there was now an assumption that ""there won't be a deal"", though it remains possible that a ""basic"" agreement could be reached if the EU gives ground in the autumn. Businesses have already been told to start preparing for a no trade deal exit from the transition period, a scenario that comes closer with each day of failed negotiations. The current round of formal talks between David Frost, the UK's chief negotiator, and the EU's Michel Barnier is due to finish on Thursday, with no expectation on either side of a breakthrough.

Traders fear chaos on Brexit front line over the long haul
",-1.125,Negative,"Brexit got done, but the new bureaucracy it demands remains uncertain. Traders and hauliers in Northern Ireland are in the front line of an avalanche of customs paperwork which threatens to bury them when the transition period ends on Dec 31. Get it wrong, and profit margins already eroded by Covid-19 will diminish further as lorries languish for hours at ports or are turned away altogether. A 170-page document setting out the new plans for the UK's only land border with the European Union will be published on Monday, and is expected to offer much-needed clarity on what customs procedures businesses will need to prepare for. But business groups warn that many small and medium-sized businesses do not have the bandwidth to deal with the new paperwork they will be expected to complete. As Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing Northern Ireland, explains: ""We only have about six large manufacturers in Northern Ireland with more than 250 employees. For the rest, the guy who does the customs is the same guy who pays the wages, places orders and looks after HR.""ù Despite requests from industry, a spokesman for HMRC told sources it would not be possible for safety and security declarations to be streamlined with customs declarations and cut the administrative burden in time for Jan 1.

Unseen and untested Brexit IT system risks customs chaos†

However, sources said the system was intended to cope with only 60 million customs declarations per year.

Britain heading for Brexit 'customs chaos'

Boris Johnson wants Brexiteer to replace ousted Sir Mark Sedwill
",-0.75,Negative,"Boris Johnson will on Monday begin the search for a Brexiteer to run the Civil Service after its current head was ousted ahead of a wholesale reform of Whitehall. Sir Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary, will stand down in September after losing a power struggle with Mr Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings. The civil service union responded by accusing Downing Street of spending months undermining Sir Mark with ""corrosive and cowardly""ù anonymous briefings. Mr Johnson intends to reform Whitehall by recruiting more Brexiteers and relocating Government departments to the regions, and made it clear to Sir Mark that he was not the man to drive the revolution. As first reported by The Telegraph, Sir Mark will also lose his joint role as national security adviser, which will be handed to Mr Johnson's chief Brexit trade deal negotiator David Frost. Mr Frost is considered one of the Prime Minister's most loyal officials, and Downing Street said his appointment means that for the first time the role of national security adviser is classed as a political role, tying it even closer to the aims of Number 10. Mr Frost has been appointed to the national security role despite having little experience in the field. He will also have little time to prepare for the role, as he will remain in charge of Brexit trade negotiations throughout July and could be called upon if negotiations run beyond then, currently the Government's deadline for reaching an agreement. In his letter to Mr Johnson, Sir Mark diplomatically said ""we have agreed that I will stand down and leave Government service""ù, while Mr Johnson said he had ""earned the gratitude of the nation""ù. But Sir Mark, who was appointed by Theresa May and does not share the Prime Minister's zeal for Brexit or for reform, had been the subject of constant negative briefings which were blamed on Number 10. He was also sidelined when Mr Johnson appointed the Duke of Cambridge's private secretary Simon Case as his permanent secretary and gave him the task of leading the Government review into the two metre social distancing restrictions. Mr Case is now a front-runner to replace Sir Mark. ",0.125,Positive

IT chaos as clock ticks down to Brexit

""If HMRC were to buy a licence for the French system that would be a very simple thing to do and traders would like it.""ù MPs were also told that 30,000 to 50,000 customs agents would be needed from January 1 to cope with new border procedures. Lars Karlsson, a former Swedish customs official and chief executive of KGH Border Services, said this would provide an opportunity for people who had lost their jobs due to the coronavirus crisis to retrain.† Nonetheless, he agreed that a lack of clarity from the Government about future customs arrangements has held preparations back.† Mr Karlsson said: ""Before we know what the border procedure will look like, specifically on the UK side, it's very difficult to test it. ""We need to know [where and how many] inspections are going to take place. Will they be done by the companies before they enter into the process of exporting and coming in for import or not?""ù Meanwhile, a key car industry body warned that manufacturing volumes will sink to historic†lows if no†Brexit trade deal is reached.

Boris Johnson to hold video meeting with EU leaders to push through Brexit trade talks

He will discuss the progress of trade negotiations in the meeting, ahead of Thursday's EU summit. The UK hopes that the Prime Minister will be able to secure commitments from the EU to intensify the talks in what is effectively his last chance to ask for an extension to the Brexit transition period. EU sources claim that Britain wants to enter ""tunnel"" talks - Brussels jargon for secret discussions carried out under media blackout - in July, which Michel Barnier has ruled out, and UK sources deny. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator said on Wednesday that he hoped the ""high-level meeting"" would bring fresh political impetus to the trade talks, which are deadlocked over fishing rights and EU demands for level playing field guarantees. Rather than tunnel talks, the UK and EU have agreed to intensify negotiations in July after the high-level meeting. A UK spokesman said: ""This new process will involve a mix of formal negotiating rounds and smaller group meetings, both in London and Brussels, assuming public health guidelines enable this."" There will be talks every week between June 29 and July 27. UK officials said Britain wanted intensified talks in July, but not tunnel negotiations. ""It remains to be seen if the EU is serious about making real progress next month,"" one source said. No 10 insists it will not ask for an extension, despite the risk of the UK leaving transition without a trade deal at the end of the year.

Michel Barnier blocks UK plan for secret 'tunnel' talks on Brexit trade deal

""It remains to be seen if the EU is serious about making real progress next month,"" a British source said. ""The Tunnel"" is Brussels jargon for secret talks carried out under media blackout and without regular briefings of EU ambassadors.

The UK and EU entered the ""tunnel"" before compromises were found over the Irish border during negotiations over the Withdrawal Agreement.† Mr Barnier told ambassadors of the 27 member states in Brussels that the two sides were too far apart on fishing rights, the ""level playing field"" and the European Court of Justice to go into the ""tunnel"". He said the UK had to show willingness to compromise on its red lines first.† ""The UK wants the negotiating tunnel with constant bargaining over the summer, but it is totally unclear on what as the positions are so far apart at this stage,"" an EU diplomat said, before suggesting any ""tunnel"" talks would only happen in September or October.† ""The wish to have a 'tunnel' when there†are no grounds to build it is blocking progress on the high-level meeting,"" a diplomat told The Telegraph.†""The UK request is only meant to justify not asking for a extension to transition.""

'British people just
don't want these jobs': what will happen to the restaurant industry under new immigration laws?†
",-0.125,Negative,"I used to buy my station coffee from a woman with a master's degree from Warsaw University. Marta made a good long black and filled me in on the latest hot anthropology topics, while she simultaneously kept an eye out for light-fingered passengers pinching newspapers from outside the kiosk. I enjoyed my daily hit of coffee culture, despite my discomfiting awareness that Marta might prefer more intellectually challenging work. Marta's gone back to Poland now, I hope to a career where she'll put her degree to good use. She is one of many European workers who have been helping the British restaurant, bar and caf√© industry flourish since 2004, when the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia joined the EU, and a flood of new immigrants arrived on our shores. As Ravinder Bhogal, chef patron of London's Jikoni restaurant points out: ""Our country has been run on the strong work ethic of immigrants from all over the world.""ù These days, the British hospitality industry is dependant on staff from the EU and further afield. The sector, which also includes hotels, nightclubs, visitor attractions and ""other leisure venues""ù, is the third-biggest employer in the UK. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that accommodation and food service account for nearly 5 per cent of all the full-time employed in the UK and 13 per cent of part-time employees. In a survey by the Food and Drink Federation after the Brexit vote, a third of companies stated that without EU nationals on the workforce, their business would not be viable. Pret a Manger has said that only one in 50 of its job applicants is from the UK, while two thirds of restaurant chain Carluccio's employees are EU nationals. According to British Hospitality Association figures, one in 10 bar staff and a quarter of chefs are EU nationals, along with a whopping 75 per cent of all waiting staff. But with the new government plans for a points-based system to†control immigration announced earlier this month, there may be far fewer workers from across the Channel to fill these roles. The magic number of points is 70, and under the new system spelt out by Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, all immigrants will need a job†offer as well as an adequate grasp of English to get to 50 points. The extra points can be bagged if the salary is above £25,600, well above the remuneration of most hospitality jobs (the average waiting staff salary in the UK is just over £16,000 a year, and for a commis chef†it is £18,000), or by having a PhD in a Stem subject - sorry Marta, that master's won't do. Another point scorer is having an offer of a job in which the UK has a shortage of workers. A shortage you say? All over the country, and particularly London, there is a chronic lack of chefs and waiters. The most recent Employer Skills Survey found there were more vacancies for chefs than any other skilled job. But while there are plans to fast-track NHS workers and quadruple the number of agricultural workers, no such scheme exists for kitchen or front-of-house staff. The Government may implement one if things get desperate - say, God forbid, the House of Commons dining room is short-staffed - but it will take months for results to kick in, perhaps too long for struggling outlets. In the industry, the feeling is that things began to change after the referendum result, leaving EU workers here feeling vulnerable and unwelcome. David Moore, owner of London's Michelin-starred Pied √† Terre restaurant, which opened in 1991, recalls: ""From week one [after the referendum result] I have felt it has been more tricky to find people. There were always bright young sparks who wanted to come to perfect their English, but they started to dry up really quickly.""ù His observations are echoed by other restaurateurs, and government statistics show a fall in numbers coming from the EU since 2016. One of the issues with the new scheme, according to Moore, is the need for EU immigrants to have a job in place before they arrive. ""You can't employ most waiting staff, assistant managers, sommeliers, from a distance,""ù as picking the right person is not about a good CV, but ""spirit, drive, personality and work ethic. They need to come for a day or two for a trial first.""ù ",0.25,Positive

Global chief executives back post-Brexit Britain as driver of growth
",-0.125,Negative,"Chief executives†are preparing a wave of investment in Britain as the country becomes seen as an increasingly stable place to do business in a world beset by political and economic turmoil. The UK is the fourth most important nation for business growth plans behind only the US, China and Germany, according to a PwC report†launched at the World Economic Forum's annual conference in Davos. The UK holds fourt place jointly with India and Australia. It ranks ahead of France and Japan, indicating the economy is once more punching above its weight after a spell of nervousness following the Brexit referendum in 2016. Britain is now as attractive as it was in 2015, before an EU†referendum was on the cards. Kevin Ellis, chairman of PwC UK, said: ""The findings provide timely perspective on the UK's standing as a place to invest and do business. Viewed against the turbulent global backdrop, the UK is a beacon of relative stability. ""You can't replicate natural advantages like our timezone and location between the US, Asia and the rest of Europe, but more than that the UK is a fair and trusted place to do business. ""Developing infrastructure and skills will enhance the UK's position, and ensure its increased popularity among CEOs translates to more inbound business and investment.

Letters:†The EU's intransigence over free movement puts a trade deal at risk
",-0.625,Negative,"SIR - Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has said that to have free trade there must be free movement and regulatory alignment. Where is the free movement and regulatory alignment between Canada or Japan and the European Union? Both of these countries have comprehensive free-trade agreements with the bloc. Mrs von der Leyen still does not get it: Britain does not want to be in the EU, in part because we do not want free movement or the regulatory regime. If that means no free-trade agreement, then so be it.

US-UK trade talks begin as pressure mounts on Brussels to strike deal this year
",-0.25,Negative,"Trade Secretary Liz Truss has kicked off talks with the US ambassador as Britain†scrambles to fast-track a†deal with America†that would pile pressure on Brussels. Ms Truss is understood to have this week made the case against further American tariffs on UK exports†including Scotch whisky†to ambassador Woody Johnson, in their first meeting on the matter. It follows†six working groups between policy experts to discuss a free trade agreement, insiders said. Both sides are hoping a deal to slash tariffs can be reached rapidly - cutting the cost of US goods for British consumers and opening new opportunities for British firms in the American market. If talks progress well, it is hoped the European Union will move faster in its own discussions on a post-Brexit trade agreement to avoid being left behind. A spokesman for the Department for International Trade (DIT) said: ""Retaliatory tariffs cause harm to British businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.

EU tells Boris Johnson: We cannot be close if you want to diverge
",-0.25,Negative,"A new year, a new round of Brexit negotiations - only this time it is for real. That was the message from Ursula von der Leyen, the new European Commission president as she held her first meetings with Boris Johnson. The former German defence minister was not unfriendly, not at all, but she exuded none of the bibulous, backslapping bonhomie of her predecessor Jean-Claude Juncker.† If the previous rounds of negotiations have always been an act of deferral then, Ms Von der Leyen made clear, the next phase requires a series of real-world choices, with real-world impacts for both sides. Her speech, entitled ""òOld Friends, New Beginnings""ù was very precisely calibrated - generous about the UK's contribution to the European Union; earnest about the need to forge a new relationship, but utterly unflinching about the trade-offs implicit in Brexit. ""The truth is that our partnership cannot and will not be the same as before. And it cannot and will not be as close as before - because with every choice comes a consequence. With every decision comes a trade-off,""ù she said, quietly schooling the British prime minister. There is talk in Downing Street of a sector-by-sector deal, but with less than seven months to rewire 47 years of EU membership, Ms Von der Leyen was very clear about the need for prioritisation, starting (quelle surprise) with the twin EU offensive interests of fishing rights and tariff-free goods trade.

The numbers we'll be talking about in 2030
",-0.5,Negative,"Summing up an entire decade in a few digits is no mean feat, but the number-crunchers of the Royal Statistical Society did just that in December with their ""statistic of the decade"". Ever since Benjamin Disraeli's ""damn lies""ù slur, statistics have provoked mistrust. But it is hard to argue with the Society's choice of 0.3pc: that is, the barely there average annual growth in productivity seen throughout the 2010s, and a mere fraction of the 2pc average seen before the financial crisis. The average punter might shrug, but may pay more attention after recognising the impact the figure will have had on†pay packets over the past decade.† Lacklustre growth in productivity -†the fountain from which wages, wealth and rising living standards spring -†has been the economic story of the past decade, thanks to factors like falling business investment, or rock-bottom interest rates keeping alive ""zombie""†companies that should have gone to the wall.† But when we look back in 2030, what will be the statistic that tells the story of the 2020s -†the era of Brexit, artificial intelligence and a less certain global order? We examine five contenders: One possible contender for statistic of the new decade is 19.6pc. That's the share of the UK population likely to be over the age of 67 -†the state pension age in 2030 -†in 10 years' time. The Office for National Statistics' forecasts for the 2014-2039 period show the share of the UK population above the age of 67 increasing to one in five people in a decade, compared to one in six or 16.6pc now. An ageing workforce is part of the UK's weak productivity story, even before the potential impact of Brexit on the economy's labour supply. But the phenomenon of the retirement of the ""baby boomer""†post-war generation will bring increasing pressure to bear on the public finances, as the burden of looking after a greying population falls on fewer shoulders.† In the lead-up to the Conservatives' general election win, there were plenty of promises on spending. But there was also a deafening silence on social care,†despite the prime minister saying on taking office that he had a plan to deal with a potential crisis in funding care of the elderly. The Office for Budget Responsibility put it bluntly in its 2018 assessment†of public finances, which are†""likely to come under significant pressure""ù due to ageing and† health spending and could add an extra £172bn to government outlays by 2068. The second half of the last century was spent worrying about the Soviet Union -†but the rise of China dominated the start of this one.

After months of delay and deadlock over Brexit, the Prime Minister said that it was now the time to act and forge a new relationship with the rest of Europe and ""begin the healing for which the whole people of this country yearn"". MPs on Friday overwhelmingly passed the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill at its second reading, formally starting process of the UK leaving the EU. MPs voted by a majority by 358 votes to 234, a majority of 124.† MPs also backed the Government's three-day timetable by a majority for the remaining stages of the Bill in the Commons which means peers should start to scrutinise the legislation in mid-January, in time for the Jan 31 deadline. It was the first chance MPs had to vote on the deal since last week's General Election which handed the Conservatives a commanding Commons majority. The Prime Minister told MPs that the Bill must not be seen as a victory for one party or faction before adding: ""This is the time when we move on and discard the old labels of Leave and Remain. ""In fact, the very words seem tired to me - as defunct as Big-enders and Little-enders, or Montagues and Capulets at the end of the play. ""Now is the time to act together as one reinvigorated nation, one United Kingdom, filled with renewed confidence in our national destiny and determined at last to take advantage of the opportunities that now lie before us."" The new Bill has been tightened up to stop campaigners trying to scupper its progress in the courts ahead of the UK's expected exit from the EU on Jan 31. Mr Johnson said: ""We will be able to move forward together. The Bill ensures that the implementation period must end on January 31 with no possibility of an extension. ""And it paves the path for a new agreement on our future relationship with our European neighbours based on an ambitious free-trade agreement, with no alignment... on EU rules, but instead control of our own laws and close and friendly relations. ""This vision of the United Kingdom's independence, a vision that inspires so many, is now if this Parliament, this new Parliament allows, only hours from our grasp. ""The oven is on, so to speak, it is set at gas mark four, we can have it done by lunchtime, or late lunch.""

He said: ""This deal will not protect or strengthen our rights, or support our manufacturing industry and vital trading relationships, or protect our natural world in a time of unprecedented climate crisis. "" However Mr Corbyn said that his party ""recognises the clear message"" from voters at the election but confirmed he would instruct Labour MPs not to support the Bill on its passage through the Commons.
